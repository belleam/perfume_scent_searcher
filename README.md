## Scent Searcher

The Scent Searcher explores search functions that allow users to find perfumes that match their desired scents.

The functions created in the notebook include:
* TF-IDF-based search function
* USE-based search function

The TF-IDF function has been implemented in a [Streamlit app](fill in later).

Please note this is an extension to a [fragrance recommendation system project](https://github.com/belleam/perfume). Full details of data cleaning can be found in [this notebook](https://github.com/belleam/perfume/blob/main/perfume.ipynb).

The dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nandini1999/perfume-recommendation-dataset) and was scraped from the fragrance retailer Luckyscent's e-commerce website.
