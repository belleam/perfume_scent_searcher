Tihota Eau de Parfum,Indult,"Rapa Nui for sugar, Tihota is, quite simply, The One. The One that will call to you every moment you're not smelling it, The One that you've only had hints of in other vanilla perfumes, The One that lasts and lasts, The One that has perfectly captured the essence of the pure nature of fresh vanilla beans and has harnessed it beyond your wildest dreams.

The result is the pure magic, an unbridled vanilla, sweet, raw and achingly desirable. Of course, Tihota isn't the first perfume to focus on the dark sweetness of vanilla... perfumery is filled with vanillas, but this smells like the dream of a master perfumer who was obsessed with vanilla and was finally given free rein to worship the note with no apologies.

Lavender is so connected to Provence that often farmers don't realize that it was introduced during the Roman invasion which gave this region the designation of â Provincia Romana' from which its name derives..

Celestial Eau de Parfum,Electimuss,"Heavenly, divine and of the gods. Gazing to the stars, the Romans were keen astronomers naming the planets after gods, and such was their belief in the power and influence of the skies over their destiny that they were also keen devotees of astrology.

Thurible Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes,"The best kept secret about incense in perfumery is how magically versatile it is- it can be smoky, of course, but also resinous and animalic, or sparkling and fresh, or opulent and narcotic. Thurible is the rare incense scent that seems to contain it all, a wonderfully complex ode to this beloved material that still coalesces into a beautifully wearable and stylish signature. A sweet, clove-forward spice and herb blend supplements the church-ier aspects of the incense- cool, smoky, and sheer- while warmer, more resinous facets intertwine with rich, earthy labdanum and patchouli. A third chord- clean, sparkling incense with fresh rose and oakmoss- pulls everything together with a timeless twinkle.

Suede Eau de Parfum,Rook Perfumes,"Polarizing and provocative, Rook's take on leather is perhaps not as smooth as the name Suede might suggest, but for those who love animalic, realistically raw leather, there's nothing else like it. Smoky, rugged, untanned leather is the star, still recognizably charred and fleshy, harkening back to times where leather was still made by hand. It weaves in a rich tobacco leaf, earthy, sweet, and natural, like the leathermaker was sitting at his tanning bench with a rolled cigarette dangling from his lips. While a delicate undercurrent of smooth suede makes the name more than just playful irony, those who only love the most delicate leather scents may want to look elsewhere. But for those who love raw, animalic, smoky leather, this is a magic potion not to be missed.","suede, tobacco leaf, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/859005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,polarizing provocative rook's take leather perhaps smooth name suede might suggest love animalic realistically raw leather there's nothing else like smoky rugged untanned leather star still recognizably charred fleshy harkening back times leather still made hand weaves rich tobacco leaf earthy sweet natural like leathermaker sitting tanning bench rolled cigarette dangling lips delicate undercurrent smooth suede makes name playful irony love delicate leather scents may want look elsewhere love raw animalic smoky leather magic potion missed,"suede, tobacco leaf, leather"

Interlude Black Iris Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Inspired by a 1926 close-up painting of an Iris flower by Georgia O'Keeffe, Interlude Black Iris is a deeply seductive and wickedly clever re-imagining of a regal men's classic. Just as with the original Interlude Man, a initially imposing burst of almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals a wondrously harmonious interior life as it develops; but whereas the original Interlude carried the effusive, spice-laden warmth of the baking desert sun, Black Iris is a dispatch from the inky midnight sky, stars illuminating a mouthwatering smorgasbord of rare delights. The intense aromatic oregano and rosemary of the original is toned down here, leaving the opening relatively cool, sparkling, and wet, which in turn unlocks the narcotic smoothness of buttery orris and violet leaf. Richly smoky agarwood and frankincense still carry their royal splendor, but the base leans more towards sandalwood and cedar, creamy and robust. If Interlude Man is a blinding crown of polished jewels, Interlude Black Iris is a flowing, impossibly soft velvet robe- and what king doesn't need both?","bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41899.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired close painting iris flower georgia o'keeffe interlude black iris deeply seductive wickedly clever imagining regal men's classic original interlude man initially imposing burst almost majestically powerful frankincense reveals wondrously harmonious interior life develops whereas original interlude carried effusive spice laden warmth baking desert sun black iris dispatch inky midnight sky stars illuminating mouthwatering smorgasbord rare delights intense aromatic oregano rosemary original toned leaving opening relatively cool sparkling wet turn unlocks narcotic smoothness buttery orris violet leaf richly smoky agarwood frankincense still carry royal splendor base leans towards sandalwood cedar creamy robust interlude man blinding crown polished jewels interlude black iris flowing impossibly soft velvet robe king need,"bergamot, rosemary, violet leaves, orris, amber, frankincense, cistus, myrrh, vanilla, leather, agarwood smoke, patchouli, sandalwood, cedar"
Escale En Haiti Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables,"Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables transports us to the bustling and beautiful Les Cayes region of Haiti, and their signature crop- vetiver, considered by many to be the best in all the world. Les Cayes vetiver is renowned for its richness and depth- allowed to mature beneath the soil for up to 2 years before harvesting, it develops uniquely bright, sweet citrus tones in addition to the expected earthy and woody properties. And for Escale En Haiti, Les Indemodables uses a 22% concentration of the absolute finest vetiver Les Cayes has to offer: a ""Grand Cru"" distillation hand-selected from unique terroir, carefully root-harvested, and painstakingly distilled at atmospheric pressure, a slower and more expensive process that provides a richer, longer-lasting extract. The results are a stunning natural vetiver cologne with real depth, each ingredient carefully chosen to highlight an element of the extraordinary main ingredient. Electric pink pepper from Reunion Island and aromatic juniper oil from Macedonia bring a spicy, fresh burst, while rich Venezuelan tonka and Somalian myrrh essential oil add a touch of creamy, powdered elegance to the subtle but long-lasting base. Vetiver lovers looking for both freshness and disctinction- this is one you won't want to miss.","pink pepper, juniper, vetiver, tonka bean, myrhh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perhaps classic scents l'eau de cologne style stays perpetually fashion wonderful simplicity featuring lighter concentration puts emphasis freshness wearability edc actually ideal format showcase exquisite natural materials high concentrations might feel overwhelming part richer busy perfume escale en haiti les indemodables transports us bustling beautiful les cayes region haiti signature crop vetiver considered many best world les cayes vetiver renowned richness depth allowed mature beneath soil years harvesting develops uniquely bright sweet citrus tones addition expected earthy woody properties escale en haiti les indemodables uses concentration absolute finest vetiver les cayes offer grand cru distillation hand selected unique terroir carefully root harvested painstakingly distilled atmospheric pressure slower expensive process provides richer longer lasting extract results stunning natural vetiver cologne real depth ingredient carefully chosen highlight element extraordinary main ingredient electric pink pepper reunion island aromatic juniper oil macedonia bring spicy fresh burst rich venezuelan tonka somalian myrrh essential oil add touch creamy powdered elegance subtle long lasting base vetiver lovers looking freshness disctinction one want miss,"pink pepper, juniper, vetiver, tonka bean, myrhh"
Escale En Indonesie Eau De Cologne,Les Indemodables,"Perhaps the most classic of all scents, the ""L'eau de Cologne"" style stays perpetually in fashion because of its wonderful simplicity. Featuring a lighter concentration that puts its emphasis on freshness and wearability, an EDC can actually be an ideal format to showcase exquisite natural materials in high concentrations that might feel overwhelming as part of a richer, more busy perfume. With Escale En Indonesie, Les Indemodables has chosen to showcase a spectacular specimen of one of the most precious materials in all of perfumery- ambergris. Recovered from the paradise of Sumatra, Indonesia, this top-graded white ambergris was painstakingly distilled into a ""Grand Cru"" tincture, broken down with state-of-the-art ultrasound and then carefully tinctured for over six months to achieve a sublime level of complexity. Every possible facet of this fabled material- vivid ozonic tones, sensual animalics, and electric saltiness- are fully presented, delivering a depth and longevity that are rare for an eau de cologne. And a suite of carefully chosen complementary notes add more EDC freshness- a sunny sparkle of Calabrian bergamot and Sicilian lemon combine with a green, floral freshness from Moroccan neroli oil. Each note teases out even more complexity from the ambergris, which feels as bright and refreshing as the citrus opening but soon gains creamy, seductive tonality from a smooth jasmine and sandalwood base. Don't worry if this sounds a bit heavy for an EDC, as it's delivered with a wonderfully light touch that makes it oh so wearable. But if you've ever wanted a scent that harnessed the true power of ambergris while also maintaining delightful everyday wearability, don't let this hidden gem pass you by.","bergamot, lemon, neroli, ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perhaps classic scents l'eau de cologne style stays perpetually fashion wonderful simplicity featuring lighter concentration puts emphasis freshness wearability edc actually ideal format showcase exquisite natural materials high concentrations might feel overwhelming part richer busy perfume escale en indonesie les indemodables chosen showcase spectacular specimen one precious materials perfumery ambergris recovered paradise sumatra indonesia top graded white ambergris painstakingly distilled grand cru tincture broken state art ultrasound carefully tinctured six months achieve sublime level complexity every possible facet fabled material vivid ozonic tones sensual animalics electric saltiness fully presented delivering depth longevity rare eau de cologne suite carefully chosen complementary notes add edc freshness sunny sparkle calabrian bergamot sicilian lemon combine green floral freshness moroccan neroli oil note teases even complexity ambergris feels bright refreshing citrus opening soon gains creamy seductive tonality smooth jasmine sandalwood base worry sounds bit heavy edc delivered wonderfully light touch makes oh wearable ever wanted scent harnessed true power ambergris also maintaining delightful everyday wearability let hidden gem pass,"bergamot, lemon, neroli, ambergris, jasmine, sandalwood"
Zeste de Gingembre Eau de Parfum,HEELEY,"A mouthwateringly electric cocktail of pure ginger refreshment, Zeste de Gingembre is the best showcase yet of James Heeley's talent for creating sophisticated fresh scents that truly energize and delight. There's nothing over-complicated about the structure here- Zeste opens with, appropriately, an eye-poppingly vivid burst of orange zest, sharp, bright lemon, and crisp, tart lime.

Escentric 05 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza Schoen
Cashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees.
Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules.","fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30861.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,escentric wanted create different kind summer fragrance instead usual aqueous notes inspired walking sea hot afternoon dry aromatic mediterranean herbs trees geza schoen cashmeran molecule heart series dry radiant warm woody unexpected touch pine resin vibrant quality caused geza schoen flash back mediterranean spent childhood summers result escentric truly different kind summer scent infused vivid glowing warmth contrast sun baked plants trees escentric opens wonderfully simply top light fresh bergamot bright happy orange note chosen represent orange groves hypothetical island destination laurel rosemary carry signature freshness spiciness herbal character juniper plays dry pungent woodiness cypress drydown features two classic mediterranean ingredients cistus labdanum sweet leathery balsamic richness mastic tree based resin clean sharp scent newly cut branches they're layered signature series ingredient cashmeran intoxicating concentration within formula provides sensual woodsy warmth far typically freshie summer scent escentric captures emotional warmth summer memories scent signature stylishness escentric molecules,"fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super"
1979 New Wave Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois,"As the seventies turned to the eighties, the nightlife at Bains Douches turned from the glitzy excess of disco to a new sound that was both melodic and modern, but also rawer and more emotionally intense than what had come before. As an ode to this New Romanticism and its dark and cheerful contradictions, 1979 New Wave is a truly intriguing combination of exceptionally bright, aldehydic herbaceous notes contrasted against a rich base of gorgeous, woodsy orris. The cool, bracing freshness of a mint bouquet explodes off the skin, the aldehydes providing a modern, gently soapy sparkle, which lifts up the (dare we say gloomy?) sensuality of the buttery orris heart, which otherwise might sink under its own complex richness. The smoothly musky base supports both the lighter and darker aspects of the scent, as crisp, aromatic cedarwood keeps the energy up while creamy sandalwood and warm amber coax warmer aspects from the orris.

We have to admit, we've been feeling a bit lost lately amongst all these challenging, avant-garde conceptual pieces- every now and again, don't you just want to wear something unapologetically luxurious?

Magnolia Grandiflora - Michel Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora,"Michel Roudnitska's expressive, sensuous compositions are few and far between. An accomplished photographer and fervent traveler, he has all but given up commercial perfumery to dedicate himself to other pursuits. But when he met Saskia Havekes, a renowned Australian floral designer, he offered her â and perfume lovers â a priceless gift: the formula of a magnolia fragrance inspired by the magnolia tree in his parents', now his, garden near Grasse. The scent he had worked on for his own pleasure had found a home at Grandiflora.
Magnolia Grandiflora Michel is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by the late Sandrine Videault, whose mentors were Michel's parents Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se Roudnitska.
While Sandrine's magnolia is fresh and shimmering, Michel's interpretation expresses the flower in its full bloom, with its lush waxy petals. As spectacular as a blossom-heavy magnolia tree, with a dark woody undercurrent boosting the heady floral bouquet. An exceptional and truly special offering.","lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, magnolia, vetiver, patchouli musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,michel roudnitska's expressive sensuous compositions far accomplished photographer fervent traveler given commercial perfumery dedicate pursuits met saskia havekes renowned australian floral designer offered perfume lovers priceless gift formula magnolia fragrance inspired magnolia tree parents' garden near grasse scent worked pleasure found home grandiflora magnolia grandiflora michel part pair fragrances dedicated grandiflora's namesake blossom unusual debut fledgling brand vibrant emotional tribute story behind scents since magnolia composed late sandrine videault whose mentors michel's parents edmond th r se roudnitska sandrine's magnolia fresh shimmering michel's interpretation expresses flower full bloom lush waxy petals spectacular blossom heavy magnolia tree dark woody undercurrent boosting heady floral bouquet exceptional truly special offering,"lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, magnolia, vetiver, patchouli musk"

Anti-Blues,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection,"""In the paintings of Jacques Monory, blue forgives everything. It makes the crime aesthetic, the threat fascination. Bathed in shades of highly desirable blue, urban and contemporary violence paradoxically becomes hypnotic.""
Anti-Blues, the first in Pierre Guillaume's new Confidentiel series, is a dark gourmand that, like the paintings of Monory, bathes warm mineral and woody gourmand notes in a cool blue wash of frankincense, combining the dangerous and the delicious. The frankincense is stark and cold, mixed with an almost alien vetiver, disguising the imposing woody bitterness coming from cacao, saffron, and amyris. Touches of hay and dark chocolate coax out the animal nuances of vanilla, already dirtied with leather and tobacco. It's a fragrance of olfactory illusion, enticing edible notes and seductive woods painting a distinctly tinted portrait of delectable darkness.","dark chocolate, saffron, grapefruit, incense, resin, amyris, cacao wood, hay, tobacco, vetiver, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/545018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,paintings jacques monory blue forgives everything makes crime aesthetic threat fascination bathed shades highly desirable blue urban contemporary violence paradoxically becomes hypnotic anti blues first pierre guillaume's new confidentiel series dark gourmand like paintings monory bathes warm mineral woody gourmand notes cool blue wash frankincense combining dangerous delicious frankincense stark cold mixed almost alien vetiver disguising imposing woody bitterness coming cacao saffron amyris touches hay dark chocolate coax animal nuances vanilla already dirtied leather tobacco fragrance olfactory illusion enticing edible notes seductive woods painting distinctly tinted portrait delectable darkness,"dark chocolate, saffron, grapefruit, incense, resin, amyris, cacao wood, hay, tobacco, vetiver, leather, vanilla"

Douleur means ""pain"", which is a seemingly appropriate name for a fragrance created in collaboration with UK tattoo artist and bondage master Freddie Albrighton. But fear not- Douleur understands the intersection of pleasure and pain, and this uniquely bright, sweet, minty metallic rose is as utterly compelling as it is unexpected, blending modern and gothic influences to feel both wholly Bogue, and yet also like a departure from Gardoni's typical vintage-influenced animalic florals.

Ambre Stone Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus,"In Ambre Stone, a juicy burst of bergamot takes an autumnal and sensual turn with the earthy addition of patchouli, rich sandalwood with a hint of indolic jasmine. But itâs real ambergris that takes this scent to a whole new level, sprinkling the composition with that ingredientâs inimitable fairy dust, adding warmth, coziness, and sensuality like the golden light of an autumn sun on a picturesque summer scene.
Due to its rarity and cost, ambergris (grey amber), the aged and oxidized exudate from a whaleâat once sweet, earthy, marine and animalicâis largely found in synthetic form in perfume. But this almost mythic ingredient is in a 5% dose in Ambre Stone, adding a dreamy sensuousness to the edges of the fragrance's brightness.
As with all ingredients sourced by LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res, the lump of ambergris is first selected from a trusted partner. Then, Jean Philippe Paris, AFDMâs scientific director, processes the ambergris for around six months into a tincture or infusion, until it is deemed, along with the evaluation of perfumer Antoine Lie, to be ready to use. Ambre Stone, by the time it dries down, is a skin scent of voluptuous beauty that will have you inhaling yourself with abandon.","ambergris infusion, patchouli oil, jasmine absolute late crop, neroli oil, sandalwood oil, bergamot oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambre stone juicy burst bergamot takes autumnal sensual turn earthy addition patchouli rich sandalwood hint indolic jasmine real ambergris takes scent whole new level sprinkling composition ingredient inimitable fairy dust adding warmth coziness sensuality like golden light autumn sun picturesque summer scene due rarity cost ambergris grey amber aged oxidized exudate whale sweet earthy marine animalic largely found synthetic form perfume almost mythic ingredient dose ambre stone adding dreamy sensuousness edges fragrance's brightness ingredients sourced l atelier fran ais des mati res lump ambergris first selected trusted partner jean philippe paris afdm scientific director processes ambergris around six months tincture infusion deemed along evaluation perfumer antoine lie ready use ambre stone time dries skin scent voluptuous beauty inhaling abandon,"ambergris infusion, patchouli oil, jasmine absolute late crop, neroli oil, sandalwood oil, bergamot oil"

Smelling Vanille dâAmine for the first time is like opening a leather-bound vintage book in a library impregnated with the scent of pipe smoke from dayâs long gone by.
Named in homage to Amine Kalfane, LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨resâ partner in Comoros/Madagascar who provides both the vanilla and clove for the fragrance, Vanille dâAmine uses an oleoresin extraction whose olfactive profile of vanilla planifolia is quite different from the standard, with dark chocolate and plum facets.

Bergamote de G. Franco Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus,"In a tiny area of Reggio in Calabria Italy, around the strait of Messina, crops provide the bergamot oil so crucial to perfumery, lending its bright, luscious, aromatic citrus qualities to untold number of fragrances. In Bergamote de G. Franco, named after LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨resâ Italian partner Gianfranco, itâs given star billing.
Using both early and late-harvested crops of bergamot, the former imparting a very green quality and the latter a confectionary sweetness, Bergamote de G. Franco is combined with the sun-drenched honeyed mimosa flower, along with delicately sweet osmanthus, with its tea and apricot facets. In addition to the creaminess mimosa imparts, Kashmirin saffron gives Bergamote de G. Franco a leathery note, adding to the scentâs subtle complexity.

Vetiver de Pierre Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus,"In Les Cayes, Haiti, vetiver roots with their dry, earthy notes are laid out in front of LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res partner Pierre LÃ©gerâs factory where the prized ingredient will be distilled. That earthy scent quality is amplified in Vetiver de Pierre in one of its two acts. You see, there are at least two acts in this stunning and unusual fragrance that amplifies vetiverâs natural complexity, which is a perfume in and of itself.

Jasmin de Cherifa Eau de Parfum,Anthologie de Grands Crus,"Just over an hourâs drive north of Cairo, thereâs a botanical garden where LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res Egyptian partner Cherifa Fakhry and his family cultivate an array of aromatic plants, including the stellar jasmine used in the perfume that pays him homage â Jasmin de ChÃ©rifa.
Due to jasmine's high cost, most perfumes use synthetic versions, which tend to smell sharp and linear. Jasmin de Cherifa's real jasmine will take you on a journey of the flowerâs scent life cycle and in the process, taking your breathe away...
Cherifa was asked to use the flowers from their fieldsâ early, middle, and late crops to provide the full olfactive spectrum of the jasmine they harvest from June to October. Early jasmine, from June and July, is fresh and fruity. It turns floral and creamy midway through, in August, maturing into an animalic, indolic beauty in September. And that, along with an Egyptian rose absolute centifolia and a creamy Indian sandalwood to sing in its chorus, is what you get.
Velvety, fruity, creamy, and sensuous, with a surprise touch of clary sage for added brightness and dimension, Jasmin de Cherifa is a revelation demonstrating that its simplicity of construction makes it even more elegant and luxurious. As Oscar Wilde once said, âIâm a man of simple tastes. Iâm always satisfied with the best.â","jasmine absolute, rose absolute centifolia, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/836004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hour drive north cairo botanical garden l atelier fran ais des mati res egyptian partner cherifa fakhry family cultivate array aromatic plants including stellar jasmine used perfume pays homage jasmin de ch rifa due jasmine's high cost perfumes use synthetic versions tend smell sharp linear jasmin de cherifa's real jasmine take journey flower scent life cycle process taking breathe away cherifa asked use flowers fields early middle late crops provide full olfactive spectrum jasmine harvest june october early jasmine june july fresh fruity turns floral creamy midway august maturing animalic indolic beauty september along egyptian rose absolute centifolia creamy indian sandalwood sing chorus get velvety fruity creamy sensuous surprise touch clary sage added brightness dimension jasmin de cherifa revelation demonstrating simplicity construction makes even elegant luxurious oscar wilde said man simple tastes always satisfied best,"jasmine absolute, rose absolute centifolia, sandalwood"
I Love YY,Bogue Profumo,"I LOVE YY is Antonio Gardoni's dual declaration of love- first, to New York City, a place he fell over heels for from his very first visit. But that title isn't a typo- YY, another object of his affection, is short for ylang-ylang, that uniquely big, open, complex floral known for all the ways it smells unlike any other flower- sometimes grassy, sometimes gourmand, sometimes woodsy and resinous. When we asked Antonio to make us an exclusive fragrance to celebrate the opening of our first NYC boutique, he connected NY and YY, and the rest was a match made in heaven- or, at least, in the heart of Nolita.
And leave it to Antonio to construct a fragrance that truly captures the energy and beauty of NYC. I LOVE YY is a whirlwind of delightful chaos, with perfect touches of New York everywhere you look- cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. The titular ylang note is camphorous and lactonic, joining tonka, rose, and jasmine to feel sweet and rich, buzzing like a packed after-hours party. Cold, fizzy grapefruit captures a brisk spring morning run in Central Park. An edgy violet leaf recalls the flashbulbs and fluorescents of a hot new gallery opening in the Meatpacking District. And all of these notes intertwine in a glorious hum of energy, light, sweetness and intoxicating depth that can only represent one single, gigantic, overwhelming, wonderful city. We couldn't be more excited that Antonio Gardoni and Bogue chose to join us in our inaugural NYC adventure. Won't you come with us?","ylang-ylang, grapefruit, jasmine, rose, tonka, violet leaf, vanilla, benzoin, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,love yy antonio gardoni's dual declaration love first new york city place fell heels first visit title typo yy another object affection short ylang ylang uniquely big open complex floral known ways smells unlike flower sometimes grassy sometimes gourmand sometimes woodsy resinous asked antonio make us exclusive fragrance celebrate opening first nyc boutique connected ny yy rest match made heaven least heart nolita leave antonio construct fragrance truly captures energy beauty nyc love yy whirlwind delightful chaos perfect touches new york everywhere look cold fizzy grapefruit captures brisk spring morning run central park titular ylang note camphorous lactonic joining tonka rose jasmine feel sweet rich buzzing like packed hours party cold fizzy grapefruit captures brisk spring morning run central park edgy violet leaf recalls flashbulbs fluorescents hot new gallery opening meatpacking district notes intertwine glorious hum energy light sweetness intoxicating depth represent one single gigantic overwhelming wonderful city excited antonio gardoni bogue chose join us inaugural nyc adventure come us,"ylang-ylang, grapefruit, jasmine, rose, tonka, violet leaf, vanilla, benzoin, cedar"
New York Eau de Parfum,Widian,"New York City in the spring may be the most magical place in the world. For once a year, the electric bustle of the city is balanced with delightfully mild temperatures, gentle sunshine, and a fresh breeze that draws even the most cynical citydwellers out into New York's beautiful and far-flung public spaces, now teeming with the energy of new life. This is the inspiration for New York, the latest in Widian's tribute to the great cities, an explosion of bright citrus, spicy florals, and musky woods that positively vibrates with the extraordinary dynamism of the Big Apple. All the energy of a New York spring is present from the very first spray, as New York bursts forth with sun-soaked notes of lemon, bergamot, and mandarin, kissed with a burst of pink pepper. The spicy, aromatic bouquet only grows richer in the romantic heart notes, as striking floral notes of lavender, geranium and rose are combined with coriander and juniper, conjuring a lusciously fresh and deeply sensual tone. And as the smooth, ambered base of tobacco, musk, and never-too-heavy vanilla emerges, you can practically feel the sun setting, and a nighttime of endless possibilities on the horizon. It's just another perfect spring day in the greatest city in the world.","bergamot, mandarin, lemon, pink pepper, lavender, coriander, juniper, geranium, orris, rose, akigala, jasmine, patchouli, caramel, vetiver, cypriol, white musk, white amber, vanilla, ambergris, olibanum, tonka, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/709015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,new york city spring may magical place world year electric bustle city balanced delightfully mild temperatures gentle sunshine fresh breeze draws even cynical citydwellers new york's beautiful far flung public spaces teeming energy new life inspiration new york latest widian's tribute great cities explosion bright citrus spicy florals musky woods positively vibrates extraordinary dynamism big apple energy new york spring present first spray new york bursts forth sun soaked notes lemon bergamot mandarin kissed burst pink pepper spicy aromatic bouquet grows richer romantic heart notes striking floral notes lavender geranium rose combined coriander juniper conjuring lusciously fresh deeply sensual tone smooth ambered base tobacco musk never heavy vanilla emerges practically feel sun setting nighttime endless possibilities horizon another perfect spring day greatest city world,"bergamot, mandarin, lemon, pink pepper, lavender, coriander, juniper, geranium, orris, rose, akigala, jasmine, patchouli, caramel, vetiver, cypriol, white musk, white amber, vanilla, ambergris, olibanum, tonka, tobacco"
Gold II Sahara Parfum Extrait,Widian,"Like its companion fragrance Gold I, the luminous, captivating Gold II (now presented as Gold II Sahara) is built around the fragrance accord most associated with the precious metal- amber. But while Gold I's amber was powerful and opulent, Sahara is luxuriously smooth, a floral musk with a deep, soft muskiness that evaporates the concerns and trivialities of everyday life in a wondrous cloud of creamy, gently powdery sensuality.
On the very first spray of Sahara, a remarkably uplifting opening of bright citrus, rich saffron and spicy elemi invigorates, before the softness of the rose and orange blossom heart steadies the tempo and soothes the soul. In the deep, sweet base, creamy vanillic amber and musky cedarwood relax and seduce. The beauty of gold is its versatility, the ability to dazzle with subtlety as easily as with excess. In Gold II Sahara, Widian chooses that subtle road less traveled, and you're sure to go along for the journey.","saffron, orange, elemi, rose, orange blossom, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like companion fragrance gold luminous captivating gold ii presented gold ii sahara built around fragrance accord associated precious metal amber gold i's amber powerful opulent sahara luxuriously smooth floral musk deep soft muskiness evaporates concerns trivialities everyday life wondrous cloud creamy gently powdery sensuality first spray sahara remarkably uplifting opening bright citrus rich saffron spicy elemi invigorates softness rose orange blossom heart steadies tempo soothes soul deep sweet base creamy vanillic amber musky cedarwood relax seduce beauty gold versatility ability dazzle subtlety easily excess gold ii sahara widian chooses subtle road less traveled sure go along journey,"saffron, orange, elemi, rose, orange blossom, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla"
Bengale Rouge Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes,"Inspired by the stunning, tiger-like dappling of shade and light on the fur of her Bengal cat Mimi, Liz Moore's latest creation is a soft, cozily-spiced oriental that's as sensuous as a cat in full stretch. Miles away from the overt sexuality of Salome, Bengale Rouge's only hint of the animalic is the honeyed, fuzzy glow of the resins, which give the perfume a sensual warmth that's more kitten than tiger. Bengale Rouge dips a soft, attar-like rose and sandalwood into a doughy, rooty iris and wraps it all up in a halo of headily-spiced resins. It's simply gorgeous. With its benzoin-rich vanilla swirled with caramelized labdanum, clove-scented opoponax, and the citrusy brightness of a Turkish rose, Bengale Rouge at first appears to take up the glittering mantle of the great orientals of the past, such as Shalimar and Opium. However, we are steered away from the powdered classicism of these perfumes by the clever addition by the perfumer of a dollop of edible vanilla that lends the scent a modern gourmand vibe that will have you wanting to lick your own skin. The vanilla gourmand aspect doesn't dominate; but neither does the dry and spicy resin facet â they dance and intertwine like perfect halves of one whole for a golden, opulent effect that perfectly mimics the interplay of light and dark on Mimi's fur coat. It's a total love from us. What We Think A ravishing blend of warm, powdery gourmand and gently animalic notes to delight and seduce in equal measure.","rose, orris, sandalwood, sweet myrrh (opoponax), oakmoss, honey, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/665006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired stunning tiger like dappling shade light fur bengal cat mimi liz moore's latest creation soft cozily spiced oriental that's sensuous cat full stretch miles away overt sexuality salome bengale rouge's hint animalic honeyed fuzzy glow resins give perfume sensual warmth that's kitten tiger bengale rouge dips soft attar like rose sandalwood doughy rooty iris wraps halo headily spiced resins simply gorgeous benzoin rich vanilla swirled caramelized labdanum clove scented opoponax citrusy brightness turkish rose bengale rouge first appears take glittering mantle great orientals past shalimar opium however steered away powdered classicism perfumes clever addition perfumer dollop edible vanilla lends scent modern gourmand vibe wanting lick skin vanilla gourmand aspect dominate neither dry spicy resin facet dance intertwine like perfect halves one whole golden opulent effect perfectly mimics interplay light dark mimi's fur coat total love us think ravishing blend warm powdery gourmand gently animalic notes delight seduce equal measure,"rose, orris, sandalwood, sweet myrrh (opoponax), oakmoss, honey, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin, labdanum"
Avatar Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Do we even have to tell you at this point that Hilde Soliani is the undisputed Queen of Gourmand? If there's even a shred of doubt left in your mind, we urge you to indulge in Avatar, Hilde's latest and greatest, which pulls off the wonderful trick of re-creating the exact smell the moment you walk into an ice cream store. We bet you can picture it just from reading the words- the sweet, mouthwatering aroma of cream and sugar diffused into the crisp snap of cold, with the subtly savory crunch of waffle cone ever present in the background. It's that simple but oh so nostalgic tableau that Hilde has created with Avatar, inspired by Paolo Brunelli, proprietor of Compagnia Gelatieri, and as with all of her marvelous gourmands, the magic isn't in unnecessary embellishments or needless complication, but in the sheer alchemy of how perfect the facsimile is- the milky, sugary, crisply cool ice cream is pitch perfect, evoking immediate memories of childhood summers and palaces of frozen delight.

Midnight Saffron Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"Lavender is having a moment, as fragrance houses everywhere are tossing aside its reputation as a sleep-inducing hippie oil, and rediscovering its electric sensuality. Midnight Saffron, born of Tom Daxon's long standing love for lavender, takes this energy and runs wild with it, mixing up a potent cocktail of spicy woods to create a vibrantly sexy scent that will carry you into the wee hours. As the name would suggest, the central spice involved is saffron, which here is stripped of its more foody elements to reveal the raw, crackling carnality underneath- which, in turn, amps up the animalic energy of the exquisite lavender note, created from a mixture of France and Bulgaria's finest lavender oils and absolutes. As Midnight Saffron dries, a smoothly woodsy leather note enhances and refines, but the energy never dips, even in the drydown. As we mentioned at the top, Midnight Saffron is a different take on lavender- one that's ready to stay up just as late as you are.","saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lavender moment fragrance houses everywhere tossing aside reputation sleep inducing hippie oil rediscovering electric sensuality midnight saffron born tom daxon's long standing love lavender takes energy runs wild mixing potent cocktail spicy woods create vibrantly sexy scent carry wee hours name would suggest central spice involved saffron stripped foody elements reveal raw crackling carnality underneath turn amps animalic energy exquisite lavender note created mixture france bulgaria's finest lavender oils absolutes midnight saffron dries smoothly woodsy leather note enhances refines energy never dips even drydown mentioned top midnight saffron different take lavender one that's ready stay late,"saffron, lavender, jasmine, suede, amber woods"
Dolls Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit,"""A fragrance carried by vivid, extravagant colours and a surrealistic story about uncompromising love: all consuming and bordering insanity. A heavy perfume, based on animalistic notes interrupted by the subtle and light smell of snow; so repulsive in smell, so attractive in colours, so unreal.""
Dolls, a beautifully stylized fever dream of a movie directed by Japanese icon Takeshi Kitano, tackles themes of love, death, sacrifice, and freedom- complex issues that its namesake scent more than lives up to. Dolls the fragrance is every bit as abstract and experiential as its inspiration, delivering extreme but balanced bursts of animalic musks, rich florals, sweet woods, and a fuzzed-out snowflake accord that shrouds the composition in a mysterious cloak of cold freshness. This is not a scent to passively wear out on the town, but a true companion piece to a film that defies easy interpretation but delivers exceptional rewards to those with the soul to proceed. Enjoy it accordingly.","cherry blossom, geranium, davana, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, apple blossom, rose, sweet maple accord, musk, snow flake accord, ambergris, cedar, animalic notes.",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/666010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance carried vivid extravagant colours surrealistic story uncompromising love consuming bordering insanity heavy perfume based animalistic notes interrupted subtle light smell snow repulsive smell attractive colours unreal dolls beautifully stylized fever dream movie directed japanese icon takeshi kitano tackles themes love death sacrifice freedom complex issues namesake scent lives dolls fragrance every bit abstract experiential inspiration delivering extreme balanced bursts animalic musks rich florals sweet woods fuzzed snowflake accord shrouds composition mysterious cloak cold freshness scent passively wear town true companion piece film defies easy interpretation delivers exceptional rewards soul proceed enjoy accordingly,"cherry blossom, geranium, davana, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, apple blossom, rose, sweet maple accord, musk, snow flake accord, ambergris, cedar, animalic notes."
Opale Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo,"Truly a breath of fresh air, Opale is a gem of a marine floral that evokes the sun-drenched gardens and sparkling waters of the Mediterranean coast. From the very first spritz, a symphony of gentle florals flits through the air, combining the soft purity of jasmine and lilac with delicately spicy and earthy notes of hawthorne and geranium. But the core of the scent is an oh-so-oceanside note of fresh, salty, ozonic seaweed that wraps around a smooth and lively white musk to create a pitch-perfect image of a relaxing coastal breeze, which lingers for hours thanks to touches of woodsy and gourmand notes to accentuate and enrich the authentically oceanic tang. Carefree, lively, and joyful, Opale is an aquatic scent for the romantic in us all.","jasmine, lilac, hawthorne, geranium, seaweed, white musk, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,truly breath fresh air opale gem marine floral evokes sun drenched gardens sparkling waters mediterranean coast first spritz symphony gentle florals flits air combining soft purity jasmine lilac delicately spicy earthy notes hawthorne geranium core scent oh oceanside note fresh salty ozonic seaweed wraps around smooth lively white musk create pitch perfect image relaxing coastal breeze lingers hours thanks touches woodsy gourmand notes accentuate enrich authentically oceanic tang carefree lively joyful opale aquatic scent romantic us,"jasmine, lilac, hawthorne, geranium, seaweed, white musk, patchouli, cedar, vanilla, tonka"
Poudrextase Eau de Parfum,Marlou,"With a name that combines the French words for ""powder"" and ""ecstasy"", it's not difficult to imagine what Marlou has in mind with their newest fragrance. But concept alone can't do justice to Pourdrextase; after all, this is Marlou we're talking about here, a line that does one thing- intensely erotic, deeply animalic musk- and does it just about better than anyone. And even if their smolderingly over-the-top previous releases have been a bit too intense for you, we'd strongly encourage you to try again, as Poudrextase explores a duality of skin scents- on one hand, the primal musk, on the other, the fresh powder and minimal florals of expensive cosmetics on clean skin- and the result is Marlou's most wonderfully accessible scent yet. Here, the rice powder is bright and fresh, almost citrussy, and the dried rose just delicately sweet enough to smooth out the funk of the animalics, which retain every ounce of the full-bodied carnality of Marlou's previous gems. It's very much a portrait of skin in full- the proper and the profane, the clean and the dirty. We're entranced.","rice powder, dried rose, cypress, civet, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name combines french words powder ecstasy difficult imagine marlou mind newest fragrance concept alone can't justice pourdrextase marlou we're talking line one thing intensely erotic deeply animalic musk better anyone even smolderingly top previous releases bit intense we'd strongly encourage try poudrextase explores duality skin scents one hand primal musk fresh powder minimal florals expensive cosmetics clean skin result marlou's wonderfully accessible scent yet rice powder bright fresh almost citrussy dried rose delicately sweet enough smooth funk animalics retain every ounce full bodied carnality marlou's previous gems much portrait skin full proper profane clean dirty we're entranced,"rice powder, dried rose, cypress, civet, musk"

Donna Sentenza Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Donna Sentenza was born of a joke Hilde Soliani shared with famed Italian butcher, Simone Fracassi, about her possibly slipping on a banana peel. Hilde Soliani slip on a banana peel? Never! Donna Sentenza, the perfume, has the same zany sense of humor and zest for life as Hilde Soliani herself. Known for her special touch with gourmandise, Soliani now turns her attention to banana, making a perfume that's so fun that we all want in on the joke. Banana milkshake. Banana pudding from Magnolia Bakery in New York. Banana cream pie. When life is getting you down, why not take a break from it all and put a smile back on your face with this deliciously milky banana concoction? Donna Sentenza smells exactly like banana pudding, with layers of banana sandwiched with whipped cream, sugar, and a hint of smoky Nilla wafers around the edges. All good fun, of course, but underpinning it all is Soliani's seriously good vanilla, the buttery, high quality stuff that makes you want to bite your own arm. Nobody does a cream note quite like Soliani, and now we're convinced of her special banana powers too. So, if you want to smell like banana pudding from time to time (and honestly, who doesn't?) but insist on it being a super high-end, artisanal banana pudding with no nasty aftertaste, then look no further than Hilde Soliani's Donna Sentenza.

Almost immediately, the fragrance deepens to welcome an armload of fragrant spring flowers, including rose, jasmine, neroli, and iris, all smelling as if they're drenched in rain water. Running through Dia Woman's floral richness is a grounding of incense and sandalwood, reminiscent of the dim churches tucked between the city's lavish boutiques.

Against Nature Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes,"Inspired by Joris-Karl Huysmans' 1884 novel of the same name which broke from his naturalist roots, this is a decadent re-interpretation of nature at its most ornate, along with an undercurrent of unmistakably human components. Like the journey of Huysmans' protagonist, who isolated himself from earth in order to re-build himself outside of conventional society, the scent is both primal and intellectual, compelling and disturbing, untethered and utterly unapologetic. Intense notes of lush leafy green foliage, moist soil & earthy mosses merge with with notes of cold metal, blood and lacquer, invoking a wildly unique atmosphere somewhere between the primordial world and the flawed, brilliant human soul.

After all, his brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging or signature notes- a Lebreton scent is a uniquely formed work of art, with rustic, romantic and fantastical elements all hypnotically intertwined to create scents that stand alone as works of individual creativity. Cornaline, an ode to brightness and light and color, is no exception- by combining unexpected natural elements of spice, fruit, and florals, Lebreton delivers a dazzlingly bright scent that slowly, deliberately transitions into a twinkling twilight. Cornaline opens with a distinctive and unforgettable note of carrot root, almost synthetic feeling in its uniqueness, the perfect lead-in to a cascade of fruits and flowers that radiate with distinctive and unforgettable color. First, geranium shines forth with spicy assertiveness, followed by an energetic vibration of orris, and a fruit-inflected, beautifully sweet ylang-ylang. Now, the fruits and florals explode forth, painting a vivid mural of springtime delights with distinct touches of hyacinth and ""belle du jour"" mirabilis, a perfect blend of spicy and fruity. And finally, an increasingly sensual bed of musk and vanilla glows with the poised relaxation of twilight. Joyful yet masterfully restrained, opulent yet luminous, Cornaline is another opus from one of niche perfume's brightest lights.","carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang-ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,anatole lebreton conceptualizes new fragrance sit take notice brand aesthetic goes far beyond packaging signature notes lebreton scent uniquely formed work art rustic romantic fantastical elements hypnotically intertwined create scents stand alone works individual creativity cornaline ode brightness light color exception combining unexpected natural elements spice fruit florals lebreton delivers dazzlingly bright scent slowly deliberately transitions twinkling twilight cornaline opens distinctive unforgettable note carrot root almost synthetic feeling uniqueness perfect lead cascade fruits flowers radiate distinctive unforgettable color first geranium shines forth spicy assertiveness followed energetic vibration orris fruit inflected beautifully sweet ylang ylang fruits florals explode forth painting vivid mural springtime delights distinct touches hyacinth belle du jour mirabilis perfect blend spicy fruity finally increasingly sensual bed musk vanilla glows poised relaxation twilight joyful yet masterfully restrained opulent yet luminous cornaline another opus one niche perfume's brightest lights,"carrot root, geranium, orris, ylang-ylang, peach, red berries, green notes, mirabilis, musk, vanilla"
Bluebijou Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki,"For far too long, ""blue"" has been used to describe the most generic of fragrances- blandly masculine, synthetically aquatic, outright boring. But blue is so much more interesting than that- a blue scent should be hypnotically deep, harmoniously balanced, compellingly full of life. Enter Bluebijou, a unique, vibrant, unrestrained reinterpretation of the blue scent. Instead of scratchy, synthetic freshness, Bluebijou delivers juicy, sumptuous blueberry, bright violet, rich cocoa, and unmistakable truffle, all atop an impossibly deep base of dark oud and deeply boozy cognac. It's sweet, smooth, juicy and magical- and you'll never look at an underwhelming ""blue"" department store scent the same.","violet, blueberry, cacao, truffle, tobacco, dark chocolate, cognac, oud, cashmeran, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,far long blue used describe generic fragrances blandly masculine synthetically aquatic outright boring blue much interesting blue scent hypnotically deep harmoniously balanced compellingly full life enter bluebijou unique vibrant unrestrained reinterpretation blue scent instead scratchy synthetic freshness bluebijou delivers juicy sumptuous blueberry bright violet rich cocoa unmistakable truffle atop impossibly deep base dark oud deeply boozy cognac sweet smooth juicy magical never look underwhelming blue department store scent,"violet, blueberry, cacao, truffle, tobacco, dark chocolate, cognac, oud, cashmeran, musk, amber"
Kiviskin Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki,"Inspired by the beauty of luxury leather goods, Kiviskin is a bracingly fresh, invigoratingly natural-feeling scent, painting a bold portrait of spice, tobacco and suede. A richly tingling blend of saffron, nutmeg and pimento opens with vibrant energy and airy brightness, leading into a fresh, wild tobacco note with ample tonalities of spicy green, as if the plant is still firmly rooted in the field. As the leather emerges, buttressed with unsweetened dark chocolate and resinous benzoin, the result is a leather fragrance with unquestionable depth but dynamic natural freshness, and a interpretation of leather we're pleased to say we've never before experienced. Authentically deep, intriguingly modern, Kiviskin is a leather that only Piotr Czarnecki could give us.","saffron, nutmeg, pimento, violet, tobacco, dark chocolate, benzoin, cedar, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired beauty luxury leather goods kiviskin bracingly fresh invigoratingly natural feeling scent painting bold portrait spice tobacco suede richly tingling blend saffron nutmeg pimento opens vibrant energy airy brightness leading fresh wild tobacco note ample tonalities spicy green plant still firmly rooted field leather emerges buttressed unsweetened dark chocolate resinous benzoin result leather fragrance unquestionable depth dynamic natural freshness interpretation leather we're pleased say we've never experienced authentically deep intriguingly modern kiviskin leather piotr czarnecki could give us,"saffron, nutmeg, pimento, violet, tobacco, dark chocolate, benzoin, cedar, leather"

Inspired by the feeling of first entering a world-class nightclub, Venom of Angel captures the rush of light, sound, and adrenaline from the first sniff, as energetic green aloe vera and crackling black pepper burst forth, leading into a richly intoxicating cocktail of sweet, boozy rum and a wildly sexy coconut-cedar accord, creamy, spicy, and powerful.

Hili Eau de Parfum,Widian,"A lush flower garden surrounding extraordinarily preserved structures and sites dating back to the Bronze Age, the Hili Archaeological Park and Gardens is one of the true treasures of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. Drawing inspiration from the magical location, Hili, the latest from Widian's Velvet Collection, is a stunning floral oriental that captures the delicate beauty of the gardens and the intriguing mysteries of the historic site in one compelling fragrance.
Hili opens with a vibrantly colorful burst of bergamot and pink pepper, laced with a balanced strain of coriander and cinnamon. The floral heart, the true star of the show, blooms with delicate lushness, the jasmine and tuberose soft and non-indolic, the ylang and tiare sweet and gently powdered, all atop a base of smooth woods and a distinctively creamy coconut milk that the ethereally smooth florals sink into with seamless grace. All told, it perfectly represents the gardens it models itself on: a work of dreamlike beauty, expertly engineered to seem effortless.","bergamot, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, tiare, amber, vanilla, coconut milk, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar, tobacco leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lush flower garden surrounding extraordinarily preserved structures sites dating back bronze age hili archaeological park gardens one true treasures emirate abu dhabi drawing inspiration magical location hili latest widian's velvet collection stunning floral oriental captures delicate beauty gardens intriguing mysteries historic site one compelling fragrance hili opens vibrantly colorful burst bergamot pink pepper laced balanced strain coriander cinnamon floral heart true star show blooms delicate lushness jasmine tuberose soft non indolic ylang tiare sweet gently powdered atop base smooth woods distinctively creamy coconut milk ethereally smooth florals sink seamless grace told perfectly represents gardens models work dreamlike beauty expertly engineered seem effortless,"bergamot, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, tiare, amber, vanilla, coconut milk, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar, tobacco leaf"
Niral Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"Neela Vermeire has always been a line of unmatched elegance, where the rich cultural heritage of India and the refinement of western perfumery go hand in hand to create enchanting, delightful fragrances. Niral, from a Hindi word and name connoting uniqueness and serenity, is inspired by Sir Thomas Wardle, a 19th-century expert in the sericulture and the Indian wild silk trade, and so it's only appropriate that the fragrance is a stunningly smooth blend of florals, spices and musks that's as silky as they come. Opening with a refined iris, smoothed with tea and liqueur notes to balance earthy, papery and floral in perfect equilibrium, Niral gently reveals a luxuriously rich, yet subtle heart of rose, spice and musks, atop an equally serene base of precious woods and supple leather. Like Sir Thomas's silk, which was used by the eras most prestigious designers and textile artists, it's sheer textural delight, softness and sophistication all in one, and a melding of the most elegant techniques that both India and Europe have to offer- you won't want to miss it.","iris, pink pepper, tea, rose, green wine lees, cabreuva, angelica seed, ambrette seed, cardamom, leather, magnolia, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56509.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,neela vermeire always line unmatched elegance rich cultural heritage india refinement western perfumery go hand hand create enchanting delightful fragrances niral hindi word name connoting uniqueness serenity inspired sir thomas wardle th century expert sericulture indian wild silk trade appropriate fragrance stunningly smooth blend florals spices musks that's silky come opening refined iris smoothed tea liqueur notes balance earthy papery floral perfect equilibrium niral gently reveals luxuriously rich yet subtle heart rose spice musks atop equally serene base precious woods supple leather like sir thomas's silk used eras prestigious designers textile artists sheer textural delight softness sophistication one melding elegant techniques india europe offer want miss,"iris, pink pepper, tea, rose, green wine lees, cabreuva, angelica seed, ambrette seed, cardamom, leather, magnolia, jasmine, sandalwood, cedar"
London,Widian,"The Sapphire Collection, a new collection by Widian, formerly AJ Arabia, is the perfect fusion of East meets West. The East: Widian, an Arabian niche perfume firm inspired by the architecture of Sheikh Zayed's Grand Mosque and the modern Arab spirit in the city of Abu Dhabi. The West: the glittering cityscapes of the grandest Western cities, such as London, Paris, and New York. Traditional Arabic perfumery meets Western abstraction; a perfect fusion of the old and the new, the traditional and the contemporary, and yes, East and West. London is Widian's first entry in the Sapphire Collection, and it nails the East-meets-West theme with aplomb. On the surface, a juicy raspberry and delicate floral petals are flanked by a lush cypress and leather accord. But the smoky, moody darkness of agarwood from the jungles of the Far East sweeps shadows underneath the freshness of this scene, tugging us away from London and towards the East. Its exotic mystery is deepened further by amber and musk that lends the scent a radiantly dry, sandy texture, turning our gaze to the red-gold desserts of the Arabian Peninsula. Simultaneously reassuring and exciting, this fragrance is a fitting tribute to London, and the perfect vehicle to show what happens when Eastern exoticism meets Western polish. London truly is a winning proposition.","oud, cypress, violet, lily of the valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sapphire collection new collection widian formerly aj arabia perfect fusion east meets west east widian arabian niche perfume firm inspired architecture sheikh zayed's grand mosque modern arab spirit city abu dhabi west glittering cityscapes grandest western cities london paris new york traditional arabic perfumery meets western abstraction perfect fusion old new traditional contemporary yes east west london widian's first entry sapphire collection nails east meets west theme aplomb surface juicy raspberry delicate floral petals flanked lush cypress leather accord smoky moody darkness agarwood jungles far east sweeps shadows underneath freshness scene tugging us away london towards east exotic mystery deepened amber musk lends scent radiantly dry sandy texture turning gaze red gold desserts arabian peninsula simultaneously reassuring exciting fragrance fitting tribute london perfect vehicle show happens eastern exoticism meets western polish london truly winning proposition,"oud, cypress, violet, lily valley, raspberry, leather, dry amber, musk, vanilla"
Buonissimo Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Ask anyone what their fondest scent memory is, and chances are, the scent of baking bread will be invoked. For Luckyscent's 15th anniversary, our most inventive gourmand nose, Hilde Soliani, created her loveliest, most nostalgia-inducing scent, exclusively for us - Buonissimo. Imagine waking up in a charming Italian town over a simple breakfast of a hot cup of foamed cappuccino and a freshly baked sweet pastry. The fantastical Hilde brings this vision to life in the form of what the Italians call brioche- the fair lovechild between a flaky French croissant and clasically airy French brioche. It's perfectly buttery, and fluffy with a sugared vanilla. But it wouldn't be a Hilde Soliani without that how-did-she-do-that element, and here, she's captured the sweet egg wash over the pastries' gentle slopes, caramelized a crispy golden brown from the oven. And don't forget - from beginning to end, like every proper Italian day, the dark swirl of espresso and cream is ever-present, lending its mature sophistication. This is a serious must have for any gourmand connoisseur.","vanilla, cream, cappuccino",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46639.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ask anyone fondest scent memory chances scent baking bread invoked luckyscent's th anniversary inventive gourmand nose hilde soliani created loveliest nostalgia inducing scent exclusively us buonissimo imagine waking charming italian town simple breakfast hot cup foamed cappuccino freshly baked sweet pastry fantastical hilde brings vision life form italians call brioche fair lovechild flaky french croissant clasically airy french brioche perfectly buttery fluffy sugared vanilla hilde soliani without element captured sweet egg wash pastries' gentle slopes caramelized crispy golden brown oven forget beginning end like every proper italian day dark swirl espresso cream ever present lending mature sophistication serious must gourmand connoisseur,"vanilla, cream, cappuccino"
Boronia Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora,"Boronia is a very unusual fruity-floral composition based around a small, shrubby flower native to Western Australia, the eponymous boronia. Some varieties of the shrub can smell warm and woodsy, but this particular variety smells fruity and spicy, like a handful of ripe apricots dusted in cinnamon and lemon peel. There is even a minty freshness to the topnotes reminiscent of cassis leaf. The boronia also lends the perfume an ionone-rich feel, the silvery powder of violets and iris joining with a distinctive plum jam note to create an almost winey floral bouquet. The hay-like tones of a golden immortelle provide a textured backdrop to the florals, giving the scent a pleasantly rustic, early fall harvest feel: dried grass, hay, tobacco leaves turning to brown paper in the sun, and the dusty red earth of the Australian outback. Black tea and apricots create a suede impression, but it's a credit to the perfumer that the foodier notes of caramel, fruit, and cognac are never allowed to turn Boronia into a gourmand. It is fruity and rich, yes, but balanced by the tannic sharpness of tea and hay, the scent manages to stay elegantly dry. If you love the autumnal, plummy darkness of chypres such as Voleur de Roses and Mon Parfum Cheri Par Camille, then you will love Boronia too.","boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64204.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,boronia unusual fruity floral composition based around small shrubby flower native western australia eponymous boronia varieties shrub smell warm woodsy particular variety smells fruity spicy like handful ripe apricots dusted cinnamon lemon peel even minty freshness topnotes reminiscent cassis leaf boronia also lends perfume ionone rich feel silvery powder violets iris joining distinctive plum jam note create almost winey floral bouquet hay like tones golden immortelle provide textured backdrop florals giving scent pleasantly rustic early fall harvest feel dried grass hay tobacco leaves turning brown paper sun dusty red earth australian outback black tea apricots create suede impression credit perfumer foodier notes caramel fruit cognac never allowed turn boronia gourmand fruity rich yes balanced tannic sharpness tea hay scent manages stay elegantly dry love autumnal plummy darkness chypres voleur de roses mon parfum cheri par camille love boronia,"boronia, green notes, apricot, woods, resins, cognac, floral notes, black tea, tobacco, suede, caramel"
Ambilux (formerly 50ml d'Ambiguite) Eau de Parfum,Marlou,"Ambilux is ambiguous only in the sense that it is puzzling that a list of largely plant-based spices, resins, and florals adds up to something so unapologetically animal. The first blast has our eyes rolling back in pleasure: a thickly furred musk redolent of warm animal, dripping tallow candles, and the salty skin of a loved one. That there are new perfumes out there that dare to challenge the great Muscs Khoublai Khan and Musc Tonkin is a pleasant surprise. Although Ambilux is quite different to these perfumes, it possesses the same earthy, no-holds-barred sensuality and a texture that is distinctly retro in its velvety thickness. The creator intended for this perfume to reflect the unique olfactory fingerprint we all carry, our own personal aroma, imprinting onto others as we touch, kiss, and make contact. But like its distant progenitor, L'Air de Rien, it also captures the smells of our nest: dusty spaces, books, pots overflowing with flowers, and old wood. Despite the listed notes, what we predominantly pick up is a warm, oily sheep's wool nuance â waxy and lanolin-like, deeply inviting to the touch. Costus root is what gives the perfume its arousing animal fattiness, but it is used subtly here, woven into the other notes for an effect that is intimate but not uncomfortably close. The sweet, slippery feel of the woolen musk is cut with a bright, almost briny ylang note, aerating the heart with a salty breeze. In the drydown, castoreum gives us nuances of dry, smoky tobacco and leather. Ambilux captures all the grimy intimacy of our own bodies, our loved ones, and the crawl spaces of our inner sanctum: it's sexy, but also comfortable and elegant. Update: Ambilux is a new version of the beloved 50ml d'Ambiguite, made a bit lighter, warmer, and more wearable while retaining all the animalic sensuality of the original.)","pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang-ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambilux ambiguous sense puzzling list largely plant based spices resins florals adds something unapologetically animal first blast eyes rolling back pleasure thickly furred musk redolent warm animal dripping tallow candles salty skin loved one new perfumes dare challenge great muscs khoublai khan musc tonkin pleasant surprise although ambilux quite different perfumes possesses earthy holds barred sensuality texture distinctly retro velvety thickness creator intended perfume reflect unique olfactory fingerprint carry personal aroma imprinting onto others touch kiss make contact like distant progenitor l'air de rien also captures smells nest dusty spaces books pots overflowing flowers old wood despite listed notes predominantly pick warm oily sheep's wool nuance waxy lanolin like deeply inviting touch costus root gives perfume arousing animal fattiness used subtly woven notes effect intimate uncomfortably close sweet slippery feel woolen musk cut bright almost briny ylang note aerating heart salty breeze drydown castoreum gives us nuances dry smoky tobacco leather ambilux captures grimy intimacy bodies loved ones crawl spaces inner sanctum sexy also comfortable elegant update ambilux new version beloved ml d'ambiguite made bit lighter warmer wearable retaining animalic sensuality original,"pink peppercorn, cumin, incense, ylang-ylang, dune plants, castoreum, costus"
Grimoire Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton,"A Grimoire: an ancient word for an ancient tome of spells, a sacred text, powerful in the right hands and dangerous in the wrong ones. Anatole Lebreton invites us to imagine such a volume, weathered by age and coated in dust, at the center of an overgrown cabin, invisible to all but the trained eye. An open window lets just the faintest sliver of light inside, along with the scents of green moss climbing the walls and a well-cultivated garden of herbs and spices, essential for the creation of magical objects. Dense clouds of incense dance in the light-beam, hinting at secrets unknowable, power as-of-yet untapped, waiting in a realm directly above and below our own. Warm, rich woods from the cabin walls and dusty paper from the pages of the book give rich body to the unique aroma inside, comforting but imposing, like a warm embrace you might never emerge from.

The Decay Of The Angel Eau de Parfum,Timothy Han Edition Perfumes,"This is a memorizing, burnt bouquet of exotic flowers inspired by Yukio Mishima's 1971 posthumously published novel, The Decay of The Angel. Like all of Timothy Han's creations, the highest level of natural ingredients are used here, and Han's artistic vision presents a smart, deeply affecting fragrance that walks us through the 5 stages of a falling angel: decay, diaphoresis, dirt, dissatisfaction, and ultimately, darkness.
Han's olfactive interpretation of an angelic fall starts with mandarin doused rose, ylang, and neroli. The fresh opening is contrasted with a heart of indolic jasmine, ripe and just starting to wilt. Its gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along with smoldering cade, oud and cedar woods. Patchouli, tonka and labdanum add a dimension of soft earthiness.
A sensual intermingling of hedione and musk float throughout the charred dry-down, contrasting heavenly veneration and human desires. Dazzling, challenging, and alluring, The Decay of The Angel makes a strong argument for the sensual perks of mortality.","mandarin, neroli, rose, ylang-ylang, frankincense, sambac jasmine, acacia, cade, oud, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,memorizing burnt bouquet exotic flowers inspired yukio mishima's posthumously published novel decay angel like timothy han's creations highest level natural ingredients used han's artistic vision presents smart deeply affecting fragrance walks us stages falling angel decay diaphoresis dirt dissatisfaction ultimately darkness han's olfactive interpretation angelic fall starts mandarin doused rose ylang neroli fresh opening contrasted heart indolic jasmine ripe starting wilt gloriously smoky base includes crisp frankincense along smoldering cade oud cedar woods patchouli tonka labdanum add dimension soft earthiness sensual intermingling hedione musk float throughout charred dry contrasting heavenly veneration human desires dazzling challenging alluring decay angel makes strong argument sensual perks mortality,"mandarin, neroli, rose, ylang-ylang, frankincense, sambac jasmine, acacia, cade, oud, cedarwood, patchouli, tonka, labdanum"
Dryad Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes,"Liz Moores, perfumer behind Papillon Perfumes, lives in a house deep inside the New Forest, surrounded by a menagerie of children, horses, and animals that she has rescued and nurtured. Given that the forest forms a protective ring around Liz and her animals, it makes sense that Dryad feels like her most personal perfume yet, inspired as it is by the nymphs said to dwell in oak trees according to Greek mythology. Dryad is a sylvan fantasy of friendly trees linking their branches together to form a sunlit, green canopy over your head. Although far sexier and more ruggedly outdoorsy than anything from Guerlain or Dior, fans of vintage Vol de Nuit and Miss Dior will still feel a thrill of recognition at Dyrad's damp, mossy heart of galbanum, narcissus and an overdose of genuine oakmoss. Smoky, tough galbanum and clary sage add a resinous, rubbery dry warmth to the moistness of the green heart, and there is a touch of sun-burnt hay by way of deer tongue, a plant rich in coumarin and vanilla, and often used to flavor tobacco. Costus and apricot add a sly hint of naughty inner thigh â but just a hint. Dryad is a shamanic, witchy, but also relaxed scent that coaxes open the rigidly classical lines of the classic green chypre, ushering in sunlight, herbs, and a bunch of bright aromatics. The result is a Green Goddess of a fragrance, and the first green chypre that belongs more in the forest than in the boardroom.","cedrat, bigaradier orange, bergamot, narcissus, oakmoss, jonquil, clary sage, orange blossom, lavender, orris, vetiver, thyme, galbanum, costus, tarragon, apricot, benzoin, balsam, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,liz moores perfumer behind papillon perfumes lives house deep inside new forest surrounded menagerie children horses animals rescued nurtured given forest forms protective ring around liz animals makes sense dryad feels like personal perfume yet inspired nymphs said dwell oak trees according greek mythology dryad sylvan fantasy friendly trees linking branches together form sunlit green canopy head although far sexier ruggedly outdoorsy anything guerlain dior fans vintage vol de nuit miss dior still feel thrill recognition dyrad's damp mossy heart galbanum narcissus overdose genuine oakmoss smoky tough galbanum clary sage add resinous rubbery dry warmth moistness green heart touch sun burnt hay way deer tongue plant rich coumarin vanilla often used flavor tobacco costus apricot add sly hint naughty inner thigh hint dryad shamanic witchy also relaxed scent coaxes open rigidly classical lines classic green chypre ushering sunlight herbs bunch bright aromatics result green goddess fragrance first green chypre belongs forest boardroom,"cedrat, bigaradier orange, bergamot, narcissus, oakmoss, jonquil, clary sage, orange blossom, lavender, orris, vetiver, thyme, galbanum, costus, tarragon, apricot, benzoin, balsam, styrax"
L'homme Accompli Eau de Parfum,Divine,"Yann Vasnier has done it again. A fresh, bone-dry masculine leather, L'Homme Accompli exudes quiet class from every pore. Opening on the classic snap of a Farina-style eau de cologne, the bristle of herbs and lemon soon dies back to reveal a musky, violet leaf-driven leather that will bring tears to the eyes of the vintage Fahrenheit lover. It is at once a familiar and elegant smell â signature scent worthy for the man who is sure of his place in the world. Bolstered by a musky Atlas cedar, L'Homme Accompli's leather accord has tremendous body and presence, while managing to skip all the sweet, gouty richness of modern masculine leathers. And it's that lightness of touch that makes this fragrance so special - the air and space that Vasnier has injected into its structure allows room to breathe. L'Homme Accompli grows ever drier and darker as time passes, the herbs and violet leather curling up under the smoke of styrax resin and guaiac wood, and finishing in a salty whisper of beach amber. If Cary Grant were a fragrance, he would be L'Homme Accompli.","amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,yann vasnier done fresh bone dry masculine leather l'homme accompli exudes quiet class every pore opening classic snap farina style eau de cologne bristle herbs lemon soon dies back reveal musky violet leaf driven leather bring tears eyes vintage fahrenheit lover familiar elegant smell signature scent worthy man sure place world bolstered musky atlas cedar l'homme accompli's leather accord tremendous body presence managing skip sweet gouty richness modern masculine leathers lightness touch makes fragrance special air space vasnier injected structure allows room breathe l'homme accompli grows ever drier darker time passes herbs violet leather curling smoke styrax resin guaiac wood finishing salty whisper beach amber cary grant fragrance would l'homme accompli,"amber, leather, vetiver, guaiac wood, styrax, cedar, violet, lemon, bergamot"
White Madera Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo,"For years now, Omnia's Madera has been one of our reference gourmand scents- a sumptuous, mouthwatering butterscotch-vanilla-caramel delight that turns heads and entices those in its trail. Now, Omnia returns to one of their greatest hits with a fresh new take, supplementing the warm sweetness we love with a crisp, fresh, spicy new heart that ignites the senses and reinvents a classic. While the fragrance still opens with the instantly recognizable, positively sumptuous mix of vanilla bean and rich Madagascar vanilla, now it's also lightened and brightened with juicy, tart citrus. In the heart, the difference becomes even more clear, as licorice-y star anise and fiery cinnamon bring an intense, bright, and subtly masculine edge, while the soft florals of the original Madera still blend with the vanilla to provide smooth creaminess. And in the impossibly rich base, coconut and musk still join the party, keeping us firmly in gourmand territory. So is White Madera still Madera? Absolutely- the cozy, delectable vanilla you know and love is still very much present.

Inspired by architect Louis Kahn's breathtaking, groundbreaking Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Chamber is a scent dedicated to exploring interior space, something it does with an impressively creative array of materials drawn from every level of the natural world, from the bottom of a vast lake to high above our heads. To represent the museum's abundance of concrete, marble, glass, grass and solar light, Chamber employs a fascinating blend of green, fresh, mineralic and spiced notes, notably fondo de lago, a collection of plant life harvested from the lake floor, which combines with tree moss and mate to deliver a sophisticated and unpredictable green scent with compelling depth and an emerging airiness evocative of the steady flow of light across the Kimbell's famed vaulted ceilings. Kahn's genius was to design a museum space that was at once imposing and welcoming, comfortable and beautiful, and as much a work of art as the treasures it would contain. With Chamber, we add yet another treasure to the Kimbell's collection.","aquatic plants, moss, mate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,chamber's first perfume created inspired thought architecture analogy inspired architect louis kahn's breathtaking groundbreaking kimbell art museum fort worth chamber scent dedicated exploring interior space something impressively creative array materials drawn every level natural world bottom vast lake high heads represent museum's abundance concrete marble glass grass solar light chamber employs fascinating blend green fresh mineralic spiced notes notably fondo de lago collection plant life harvested lake floor combines tree moss mate deliver sophisticated unpredictable green scent compelling depth emerging airiness evocative steady flow light across kimbell's famed vaulted ceilings kahn's genius design museum space imposing welcoming comfortable beautiful much work art treasures would contain chamber add yet another treasure kimbell's collection,"aquatic plants, moss, mate"

From South Africa to Los Angeles, the jacaranda tree stands as an imposingly beautiful symbol of renewal- the brilliant purple blossoms appearing seemingly instantaneously, flooding city blocks with radiant color. These majestic trees are captured in all their gorgeous mystery in Jacaranda, a rich woody fragrance with the import and bearing of an ancient and noble forest.

Quilombo Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833,"In colonial Brazil, Quilombos were synonymous of resistance and independence. Protected by a labyrinth of rivers and impenetrable forests, these fugitive worlds encapsulated an untouched tropical landscape. Mixing together native and African roots, a wild atmosphere emerged full of dances, rhythms and delicious flavours made from cupuacÃº and dulce de leche (a candied concentration made from burnt milk). This is the scent of Quilombo, a mouthwatering treat that elevates the art of the milky gourmand beyond where we thought it could go. A sweet, creamy, ""how did they do that?""-level realistic hot milk accord wows our noses and tastebuds alike, while careful touches of vanilla and cane sugar supplement without overwhelming, keeping the composition specific and never in the realm of generic dessert scent. Long a symbol of hope, perseverance and joy in the face of oppression, Quilombos occupy an important place in Brazilian history.

La Cautiva Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833,"A heavenly musk laced with fruit and vanilla. La Cautiva means ""The Captive"" and it refers to an epic poem by Esteban Echeverria which is considered one of the first great works of modern Argentinian literature. This is an imaginative speculation about the scent of Mary, the main character, and while we have never read the poem, we can state unequivocally that she smelled delicious. This is airy and delectable â an enchanting confection that features a creamy whipped vanilla and a piercingly sweet black currant. The musk is soft spoken and warms to the skin as the edible elements come forward. Initially, there is a hint of syrup to the berries, but the intense sugar eases into a juicy, fresh currant with a hint of minty green leaves. As cloud-light and effortless as a meringue, topped with perfectly ripe berries - this is like a dessert you would eat in a dream.

Biblioteca de Babel Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833,"Cedar shelves, heavy leather bookbindings, vellum leaves, the smell of ink. The complex environment of an old book is brought to life. Named after a short story by Jorge Luis Borges, about an enormous library of interlocking rooms, housing a vast collection of books â this fragrance is about the intoxicating scent of an old library where the books have been kept impeccably dry. It is a combination of warm woods, leather bindings, and a hint of ink. The strongest element here is absolutely the wood â warm, reassuring cedar and a South American wood called cabreuva, which complements the cedar. This is deep, burnished and luxurious. The first impression is waxy and surprisingly sweet. There is a rich tuberose-like note, like a flower pressed between the pages, and a dusting of cinnamon. Than we get the soft, worn leather of book bindings, the dry spiciness of old vellum and a trace of tobacco. This is like the warm, comforting embrace of a favorite armchair, in a book-lined room.

Panthea Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"How do you picture the scent of heaven? Forget about the specificity of religion, and focus only on the general concept: a pearly-white paradise above the clouds, clean and enveloping, mysterious yet sublimely blissful. This is the scent of Panthea, a fresh, feminine, iris-driven addition to the 777 series imbued with an almost transcendent sense of grace. Pathea opens with an energetic sense of freshness, balancing the gentle juiciness of tangerine against the sparkle of pink pepper with a sweepingly smooth white tea providing a pristine backdrop. The heart of iris has plenty of compelling powdery floral character, but also a softness that eschews rooty or earthy tones in favor of delightfully lush white florals and muskiness. A delicate balance of light woods, tonka and patchouli lend longevity without bulk- the scent is weightless throughout. Spend a day in the clouds with Panthea- we doubt you'll ever want to come back to earth.","bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,picture scent heaven forget specificity religion focus general concept pearly white paradise clouds clean enveloping mysterious yet sublimely blissful scent panthea fresh feminine iris driven addition series imbued almost transcendent sense grace pathea opens energetic sense freshness balancing gentle juiciness tangerine sparkle pink pepper sweepingly smooth white tea providing pristine backdrop heart iris plenty compelling powdery floral character also softness eschews rooty earthy tones favor delightfully lush white florals muskiness delicate balance light woods tonka patchouli lend longevity without bulk scent weightless throughout spend day clouds panthea doubt ever want come back earth,"bergamot, pink pepper, tangerine, elemi, white tea, carrot, iris, jasmine, violet, carnation, white musk, tobacco flower, tonka, sandalwood, patchouli"

Crafted around a gorgeous symphony of citrus, florals and vanilla, Stephane Humbert Lucas' latest journey to faraway lands leads not to the palaces and oases of the Middle East, but to Avalon itself, a world of sweet enchantments and illusions that may be more real than our own reality. Wish Come True opens with fresh, bright citrus brushed with sweet ylang and enveloped in powder, like a ray of sunlight through a gentle fog.

MEM Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo,"Not since AimÃ¨ Guerlain created Jicky in 1889 has a perfumer done something so radical to lavender. Antonio Gardoni takes the sunny herb from its kitchen garden setting and passes it through clay, wood, minerals, burned sugar, and wax so that a new form emerges, like steel forged by the elements. MEM contains all the hallmark Bogue signatures but represents a clear step forward in complexity even from the masterpiece that is Maai.
MEM opens up on a dark lavender note that smells less like fresh herbs and more like clay and cepes. Sunshine soon arrives in the form of hops, toasted malt, and the pale ale fizz of aldehydes, lifting the scent out of its humus-rich opening. The scorched-sugar of ethyl maltol caramelizes the lavender, creating a phantom accord of fruit like the dark, almost calcified contents of a forgotten jar of peach marmalade. But as soon as the mind adjusts to this accord, MEM shifts again, this time into a rich floral heart of jasmine, rose, and ylang ylang that sacrifices prettiness for the more interesting facets of wax, gasoline, and rubber. Indian sandalwood with its wheaten milkiness and Himalayan cedarwood with its lingering note of woodsmoke work in tandem to ease the florals and aromatics into the base. The drydown, which is sturdy and beautiful, weaves the sweet dust of unlit incense into the musky, salty, animalic base of a barbershop fougere. MEM is not a perfume that lends itself to easy interpretation, it will reward your patience a hundred times over. In terms of who can wear it, MEM is something of a chimera: sometimes it seems masculine, at others, feminine. Beautiful, quixotic, and memorable, we think this is artisanal perfumery at its most daring.","petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender, ylang-ylang, lily of the valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66921.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,since aim guerlain created jicky perfumer done something radical lavender antonio gardoni takes sunny herb kitchen garden setting passes clay wood minerals burned sugar wax new form emerges like steel forged elements mem contains hallmark bogue signatures represents clear step forward complexity even masterpiece maai mem opens dark lavender note smells less like fresh herbs like clay cepes sunshine soon arrives form hops toasted malt pale ale fizz aldehydes lifting scent humus rich opening scorched sugar ethyl maltol caramelizes lavender creating phantom accord fruit like dark almost calcified contents forgotten jar peach marmalade soon mind adjusts accord mem shifts time rich floral heart jasmine rose ylang ylang sacrifices prettiness interesting facets wax gasoline rubber indian sandalwood wheaten milkiness himalayan cedarwood lingering note woodsmoke work tandem ease florals aromatics base drydown sturdy beautiful weaves sweet dust unlit incense musky salty animalic base barbershop fougere mem perfume lends easy interpretation reward patience hundred times terms wear mem something chimera sometimes seems masculine others feminine beautiful quixotic memorable think artisanal perfumery daring,"petitgrain, mandarin, grapefruit, lavender, ylang-ylang, lily valley, white champaca, jasmine grandiflorum, rose, bourbon geranium, vanilla, peppermint, laurel, benzoin, rosewood, sandalwood, cedarwood, labdanum, ambergris, musk, castoreum, civet, amber"
Delma Eau de Parfum,Widian,"The Dalma Island lies just off the coast of Abu Dhabi. It's known for its pearl trade and famous for its pearl divers and legends of buried treasure left behind by ""pearl pirates."" Widian uses the images and stories of Dalma Island as inspiration for one of its softest, sweetest compositions yet. Leather and marshmallow shape a base that is as delicious as it is fresh. It creates the foundation for Delma's creaminess, which never crosses fully into the gourmand category, but rather is contrasted by resinous guaiac and fresh green galbanum. The peach-laced floral heart of the composition is balanced by a dusting of saffron and nutmeg. Delma's contrasting notes are masterfully blended into the olfactive equivalent of the smooth, iridescent texture of a pearl. Shimmering, sweet and irresistible.","mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70909.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dalma island lies coast abu dhabi known pearl trade famous pearl divers legends buried treasure left behind pearl pirates widian uses images stories dalma island inspiration one softest sweetest compositions yet leather marshmallow shape base delicious fresh creates foundation delma's creaminess never crosses fully gourmand category rather contrasted resinous guaiac fresh green galbanum peach laced floral heart composition balanced dusting saffron nutmeg delma's contrasting notes masterfully blended olfactive equivalent smooth iridescent texture pearl shimmering sweet irresistible,"mandarin, peach, bergamot, heliotrope, jasmine, freesia, geranium, nutmeg, patchouli, saffron, leather, woody notes, marshmallow"
Liwa Eau de Parfum,Widian,"The Liwa oasis is a lush valley of date palm farms and Bedouin villages in the middle of a seemingly endless sea of sand. Its improbable beauty is the inspiration behind Widian's newest fragrance, a gorgeously modern oriental that perfectly blends stylish florals with exotic spice. Liwa evokes the oasis with lush jasmine, creamy amber, and sandalwood surrounded by dry saffron, wafting smoke and a powdery patchouli and vetiver base. It's a perfectly balanced combination of heady powdery spice and smoke with creamy sweet white florals and ambers.

Aqaysos Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection,"What is the scent of crystalline wood? This concept, of the strange geometry that might exist somewhere between nature's most versatile material and one of it's most fascinatingly exact, is what inspired Pierre Guillaume to create Aqaysos, a scent which casts a fascinatingly illusive prism that alternates between spicy, fruity and woody notes. The result is an elusive, versatile and sneakily powerful fragrance that wears like a suave, modern, and refreshing take on a certain wildly popular fruit-inflected masculine. Which isn't to say Aqaysos is another dull Aventus knockoff. In fact, quite the opposite- while the juicy, explosively fresh lime and bergamot opening is sure to delight, it's cut with an aromatic dose of coriander, lending a metallic quality to it, at once mathematically precise and yet intriguingly otherworldly. A unique heart of little-used sansho berry, with its lemon-peppery spiciness, adds fiery depth to the sweet, juicy blackcurrant. And growing ever stronger as it dries, a robustly woodsy and musky base is given subtly bitter power with a dose of cocoa bean, which asserts itself in unexpected rhythms. Lovers of fresh, fruit-and-wood driven masculine scents will surely find a new go-to with Aqaysos. But this fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets all its own.
A first for the Huitieme Art collection, Aqaysos is presented in a unique ""Shadow Flacon, "" with the iconic Parfumerie Generale silhouette blacked out by an interior ceramic coating.","lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musk, cocoa beans",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54516.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,scent crystalline wood concept strange geometry might exist somewhere nature's versatile material one fascinatingly exact inspired pierre guillaume create aqaysos scent casts fascinatingly illusive prism alternates spicy fruity woody notes result elusive versatile sneakily powerful fragrance wears like suave modern refreshing take certain wildly popular fruit inflected masculine say aqaysos another dull aventus knockoff fact quite opposite juicy explosively fresh lime bergamot opening sure delight cut aromatic dose coriander lending metallic quality mathematically precise yet intriguingly otherworldly unique heart little used sansho berry lemon peppery spiciness adds fiery depth sweet juicy blackcurrant growing ever stronger dries robustly woodsy musky base given subtly bitter power dose cocoa bean asserts unexpected rhythms lovers fresh fruit wood driven masculine scents surely find new go aqaysos fascinatingly complex crystal palace hides secrets first huitieme art collection aqaysos presented unique shadow flacon iconic parfumerie generale silhouette blacked interior ceramic coating,"lime, coriander, blackcurrant, sansho berry, woods, musk, cocoa beans"
Il Tempo delle Mele Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Ask what region has the best food in Italy and you're bound to hear some profound disagreements- after all, we're talking about the gastronomic center of the universe- but we'd be willing to bet that Emilia-Romagna comes up more often than most. The northern region that contains Bologna, Modena, and Parma is certainly a culinary powerhouse, one that Parma native Hilde Soliani has visited in her work before, but with Il Tempo delle Melle, her ode to Emilia-born chef Igles Corelli, Soliani opts for a simple, mouthwatering local delicacy- the torta di mele ferrarrese, a basic but luscious apple cake enjoyed by everyone from kids to grandparents. But as Hilde's to-die-for gourmands have always taught us, simple doesn't have to mean boring, and Il Tempo, with its vibrant, juicy tart apple, creamy vanilla, and warm, mouthwateringly lactic milk note that emerges more and more as the fragrance dries. While we weren't lucky enough to grow up in Emilia-Romagna, this scent nevertheless has a Proustian nostalgia to it, evoking images of warm family gatherings overlooking the Adriatic.

Hot Milk Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"What, exactly, is Hot Milk? One sniff and you'll realize that's not an easy question to answer. Sure, there's an intensely electric burst of resinous black pepper, nose-tingling cinnamon, and even an undercurrent of insidiously scalding chili oil, but leave it to Hilde Soliani to balance all of that firepower on top of a pitch-perfect milk note that soothes the spirit and ignites our sense of childhood with a wondrously cool creaminess. And what do those two opposite elements add up to? It seems like each time we put it on our skin, we pick up yet another facet- sometimes the energetic pepper dominates, other times the smooth gourmand aspects, and often still the two synthesize into something that resembles a rich, fascinating woodsiness. What we do know for sure- this is undeniably a Hilde scent.","milk, hot pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46634.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,exactly hot milk one sniff realize that's easy question answer sure there's intensely electric burst resinous black pepper nose tingling cinnamon even undercurrent insidiously scalding chili oil leave hilde soliani balance firepower top pitch perfect milk note soothes spirit ignites sense childhood wondrously cool creaminess two opposite elements add seems like time put skin pick yet another facet sometimes energetic pepper dominates times smooth gourmand aspects often still two synthesize something resembles rich fascinating woodsiness know sure undeniably hilde scent,"milk, hot pepper"
Carnicure (formerly L'animal sauvage) Eau de Parfum,Marlou,"Wow. Carnicure is one naughty little kitty. In case you've been looking for it, Carnicure is the sweet spot between the ferocious dirtiness of Serge Lutens Muscs Kublai Khan, the smutty florals of Kiehl's, and the milky innocence of Helmut Lang EDP. In other words, this one is not only gorgeous, not only elegant, but above all exceedingly sexy.
A brief flash of flowers â orange blossom and violet â set the mood for passion, and before we know it we're lying on a massive bed piled high with animal pelts in front of an open fire in an ancient castle. The deep, civety funk of the fur mingles with the smells of desire- salt, sweat, skin, and human fur. But an echo of the sugared flower petals and milky sandalwood still glows through the haze of musk, gently suggestive of the comfort of a lovers' bathing ritual. Innocence lost, and then regained â over and over again. This right here is the smell of human intimacy.
Update: Carnicure is a new and improved version of the L'animal sauvage, slightly reworked to deliver a newly focused base that incorporates touches of vanilla, sandalwood, ambergris, and labdanum. It's slightly less fruity than the original, but its deeply sensual spirit is unchanged.","orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,wow carnicure one naughty little kitty case looking carnicure sweet spot ferocious dirtiness serge lutens muscs kublai khan smutty florals kiehl's milky innocence helmut lang edp words one gorgeous elegant exceedingly sexy brief flash flowers orange blossom violet set mood passion know we're lying massive bed piled high animal pelts front open fire ancient castle deep civety funk fur mingles smells desire salt sweat skin human fur echo sugared flower petals milky sandalwood still glows haze musk gently suggestive comfort lovers' bathing ritual innocence lost regained right smell human intimacy update carnicure new improved version l'animal sauvage slightly reworked deliver newly focused base incorporates touches vanilla sandalwood ambergris labdanum slightly less fruity original deeply sensual spirit unchanged,"orange blossom, violet, sandalwood, patchouli, civet, vanilla, sandalwood, musk, ambergris, labdanum"

Sweet Parmesan Violet Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Life in Hilde Soliani's hometown of Parma, Italy, is possibly as close to paradise on Earth as one can get. The gorgeous, historic streets thrum with vibrant but never crowded pedestrian energy (and the occasional hometown-founded Lamborghini), the culture is relaxed yet saturated with the contributions of some of the world's most renowned artists, composers and designers, and the wine, cheese, and prosciutto are the best in all of the country. To honor this remarkable city, Hilde Soliani created Sweet Parmesan Violet, a delectable confection inspired by her native city's predilection for eating the petals of the native-grown Violetta di Parma with a dusting of sugar as a sweet treat.

Una Tira l'Altra Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Summertime in Italy means long, languid days of relaxation and banter, lounging in sunshine and watching the world go by. There's wine, of course (always wine), but on the hottest days, real Italians rich for the Luxardo, a rich cherry liqueur with mouthwatering flavour and a surprising bite. Una Tira l'Altra is single-minded in its recreation of this liqueur, resulting in a fragrance that, while straightforward, conceals endless complexity of fruit-drenched flavour. These cherries are sweet and syrupy, juicy and fruity, tart and boozy, revealing different aspects in unexpected combinations as it casually stretches itself off the skin.

Oud Orange Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"A beautiful rendering of a dark chocolate Mounds bar in perfume form. The opening notes of Oud Orange Intense are smoky and nutty, bringing to mind a pile of coconut husks smoldering in the ashes of a fire. Creamy musks and bourbon vanilla bring a cocoa-tinted softness to the mix, restraining the beachy exuberance of the coconut, and also its sweetness. What emerges is a dry, woody vanilla with a luxuriously boozy touch, like a log of driftwood rubbed lightly with coconut liquor. The oud note here is less of a headlining note than a calming influence on the other notes. Its austere woodiness turns what could have been a full-on, coconutty tropical extravaganza into an adult woody vanilla. Oud Orange Intense is both a surprise and a triumph.","coconut, fruits, bourbon vanilla, oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,beautiful rendering dark chocolate mounds bar perfume form opening notes oud orange intense smoky nutty bringing mind pile coconut husks smoldering ashes fire creamy musks bourbon vanilla bring cocoa tinted softness mix restraining beachy exuberance coconut also sweetness emerges dry woody vanilla luxuriously boozy touch like log driftwood rubbed lightly coconut liquor oud note less headlining note calming influence notes austere woodiness turns could full coconutty tropical extravaganza adult woody vanilla oud orange intense surprise triumph,"coconut, fruits, bourbon vanilla, oud, musk"
Oud Noir Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"Unlike the majority of orientals called intense, Oud Noir Intense actually lives up to its name. Weaving jasmine and roses into a brocade of pure, smoky oud, sandalwood, musk, and spices, the result is an incredibly rich, potent perfume that feels like it should be kept in a ceremonial chamber for anointing the temples and robes of Emirati royals. The fragrance is complex but so expertly blended that each note feels like an extension of the next: spicy florals, creamy musks, animalic oud oil, smoky-sweet resins, and earthy patchouli all swirled together like cream through a cup of black coffee.

Sahraa Oud Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"Despite its desert inspiration, Sahraa Oud is a perfume that is as placidly, richly golden as a piece of Bvlgari costume jewelry. Featuring a large dollop of the real oud oil that Fragrance du Bois sources directly from its plantations in Asia, its soft but feral aroma is cushioned by layers of sweet, orangey amber, sandalwood, and roses â essentially a dab of oud buried deep within the folds of Fendi's Theorema. Warm, soft, and almost waxy in its roundness, this is a scent that gives off the satiny glow of an aged wine. A touch of inky moss and spicy saffron lends Sahraa Oud a chypre touch, giving the waxy amber a faintly bitter, pleasing bite, like the patina on old wood. Rather than the desert, Sahraa Oud brings us to a backstreet in Tokyo, its velvety darkness lit by strings of glowing red and orange lanterns.","rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,despite desert inspiration sahraa oud perfume placidly richly golden piece bvlgari costume jewelry featuring large dollop real oud oil fragrance du bois sources directly plantations asia soft feral aroma cushioned layers sweet orangey amber sandalwood roses essentially dab oud buried deep within folds fendi's theorema warm soft almost waxy roundness scent gives satiny glow aged wine touch inky moss spicy saffron lends sahraa oud chypre touch giving waxy amber faintly bitter pleasing bite like patina old wood rather desert sahraa oud brings us backstreet tokyo velvety darkness lit strings glowing red orange lanterns,"rose, geranium, jasmine, moss, patchouli, sandalwood, saffron, vanilla, amber, pure oud"

Oud Bleu Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"Oud Bleue Intense does indeed have a strangely ""blue"" vibe to it. Bracing and intense, its mixture of marine air, earth, truffles, and ozone is simply intoxicating. Opening with an earthy, fungal myrrh fused with oily sandalwood, the scent picks up spice in the form of nutmeg and cardamom but retains that cool tone. A bright mandarin note weaves it way through the resins and spices, keeping things as fresh as a Mediterranean breeze. The citrus, myrrh, and spices continue to dominate well into the heart, where they merge smoothly with a rich, balsamic amber. In what has become a signature of Fragrance du Bois, the pure oud oil in this composition is deployed as a unifying balm to knit all the other elements together rather than to stand out on its own. If you're wary of oud but love fresh, spicy, balsamic ambers, then give this one a try.

Oud Rouge Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"There is something incredibly sexy about Oud Rouge Intense. At first glance, the notes seem minimalistic.

Imagine making love in the middle of a forest, your skin, sweat, and hair mingling with the soil, wood dust, and ion-charged air, and that's what this smells like.

La Haine Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit,"A contemporary black and white masterpiece directed by Mathieu Kassovitz's, the film is set in a banlieue (government housing project) outside of Paris. In 24 hours, the movie provides a passage way into the lives of a mixed-race young male trio, consumed with the hatred fueled by police brutality and racial conflict. The fragrance was created to capture specific moments of aggression and tension in the film with smells of a cold blade, polished gun steel and the burning from riots and rubber from drive by shootings. Built around these elements are the scent of concrete and the septic environmental smells that fill the walls of government housing projects.","aldehyde, buchu leaf, bay, birch, cedar, metallic accord, leather, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,contemporary black white masterpiece directed mathieu kassovitz's film set banlieue government housing project outside paris hours movie provides passage way lives mixed race young male trio consumed hatred fueled police brutality racial conflict fragrance created capture specific moments aggression tension film smells cold blade polished gun steel burning riots rubber drive shootings built around elements scent concrete septic environmental smells fill walls government housing projects,"aldehyde, buchu leaf, bay, birch, cedar, metallic accord, leather, moss, musk"

Salome Eau de Parfum,Papillon Artisan Perfumes,"Close the blinds and send the kids to bed- Salome, the latest sensation from Papillon Artisan Perfumes, is Sexy with a grown-up, capital ""S""-- a swooningly vintage-feeling delight that proves that the golden era of full-bodied perfumery isn't nearly as bygone as the doubters might claim. Built around a strikingly animalic blend of rich, dirty florals and even dirtier animalics, Salome is put together with such deft, classic skill that we'd be praising its refinement- that is, if we weren't busy picking our jaws up off the floor. Just as the biblical Salome had a seven-veiled dance of progressive seduction, so too does Salome seduce in tantalizing layers. At first spray, we're struck with bright, bitter orange blossom and the sweet richness of rose and jasmine, with the indolic sensuality of the florals growing gradually. As the rich heart of animalics begins to growl, suggestiveness turns to an all-out bacchanal, with hyraceum, castoreum and an increasingly indolic jasmine all adding their own elements of dirty, carnal power. As Salome reaches the extended final drydown, smoky leather and deep oakmoss begin to move in slower, more deliberate momentum, still every bit as carnal but now even deeper and more luxuriously vintage-feeling. Vibrant, erotic, classic and devastatingly gorgeous, Salome is another big win from one of the most exciting new houses in niche fragrance.","jasmine, carnation, bitter red orange, rose, orange blossom, tobacco, hyraceum, styrax, vanilla, hay, patchouli, bergamot, oakmoss, cumin, birch tar, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,close blinds send kids bed salome latest sensation papillon artisan perfumes sexy grown capital swooningly vintage feeling delight proves golden era full bodied perfumery nearly bygone doubters might claim built around strikingly animalic blend rich dirty florals even dirtier animalics salome put together deft classic skill we'd praising refinement busy picking jaws floor biblical salome seven veiled dance progressive seduction salome seduce tantalizing layers first spray we're struck bright bitter orange blossom sweet richness rose jasmine indolic sensuality florals growing gradually rich heart animalics begins growl suggestiveness turns bacchanal hyraceum castoreum increasingly indolic jasmine adding elements dirty carnal power salome reaches extended final drydown smoky leather deep oakmoss begin move slower deliberate momentum still every bit carnal even deeper luxuriously vintage feeling vibrant erotic classic devastatingly gorgeous salome another big win one exciting new houses niche fragrance,"jasmine, carnation, bitter red orange, rose, orange blossom, tobacco, hyraceum, styrax, vanilla, hay, patchouli, bergamot, oakmoss, cumin, birch tar, castoreum"
Black I Parfum Extrait,Widian,"The original fragrance from Widian by AJ Arabia, Black I distinguishes itself from the flock of Euro/Oriental hybrids in a key way: while inspired by the grandeur of Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi and rich with perfectly blended spices, Black I is not an ode to opulence. Yes, it's gorgeous, compelling, and exotic, but where another brand might have opted for overindulgence and complication, Black I is a streamlined delight: a mouthwatering, captivatingly individual concoction of spice, incense and woods that's as comforting and casually easy to wear as the hippest of modern perfumery could hope to produce. Black I opens with a simple, but extremely compelling, blend of cardamom and cinnamon- spicy but not nose wrinkling, with a savory subtlety that positively enchants. A heart of delicate incense and smooth cypress adds sophistication and depth, while the drydown of musky sandal and cedar contributes longevity and a sexy modern backbone.

Bois Lumiere Eau de Parfum,Anatole Lebreton,"It is a uniquely French ability to find the romantic sophistication in almost anything, including the inhospitable climate of Mediterranean garrigue land in drought season- climate that inspired the creation of Bois Lumiere. Like a boiling sun beating down on wild immortelle flowers set amongst the parched, rocky terrain, Bois Lumiere projects a dusty, intensely bright floral and woodsy character, honey sweet but bone dry, a hot desert wind that sings of sun-soaked relaxation and an almost alien beauty. Bois Lumiere opens with the aromatics of desert terrain, wild juniper, clary sage and balsam lending resinous richness without a hint of moisture. Through the dryness, sweet honey emerges alongside brittle but sweet florals- immortelle, carnation and rose that lend their perfume to the desert conditions with a dehydrated herbaceousness. In the base, cedarwood provides a stout backdrop for the sweet brightness, absorbing the warmth with languid comfort.

Alchemico Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari,"The Mazzolari line has always embraced duality: a century of history but a newcomer to the niche fragrance scene, classic influences but modern compositions, Italian style and global influence. Alchemico, as the name appropriately suggests, is a fusion of all that Mazzolari was, is, and will be, a suitably dreamlike, yet contemporary, incense scent with classical leanings but thoroughly modern flourishes. Alchemico opens with an instantly compelling top note combining fresh, young rose with smooth cypress and a jolt of energized, crisp pepper, all blended seamlessly with compelling effect. In the heart, the main incense note hits a steady beat almost immediately, playing off the pepper to feel both languidly smokey and energetic all at once, while an earthy geranium note fleshes out the incense's rougher, deeper facets. In the drydown, this is accentuated even more with a spicy, grassy vetiver note, but just when it seems like Alchemico might go too far towards the earth, a soft, warm amber sends it back aloft, adding a lightly sweet undertone that floats the floral woodsiness to the surface yet again. As with any bout of alchemy, choosing the ingredients is only the beginning. It's the blend where the magic gets made.","rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mazzolari line always embraced duality century history newcomer niche fragrance scene classic influences modern compositions italian style global influence alchemico name appropriately suggests fusion mazzolari suitably dreamlike yet contemporary incense scent classical leanings thoroughly modern flourishes alchemico opens instantly compelling top note combining fresh young rose smooth cypress jolt energized crisp pepper blended seamlessly compelling effect heart main incense note hits steady beat almost immediately playing pepper feel languidly smokey energetic earthy geranium note fleshes incense's rougher deeper facets drydown accentuated even spicy grassy vetiver note seems like alchemico might go far towards earth soft warm amber sends back aloft adding lightly sweet undertone floats floral woodsiness surface yet bout alchemy choosing ingredients beginning blend magic gets made,"rose, cypress, pepper, incense, geranium, vetiver, amber"

Augusto Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari,"The legacy of the Mazzolari line dates back to the original Augusto Mazzolari, a late-1800's Milan barber renowned for the fresh, bright fragrances he would whip up on the spot for his customers. It continued through his grandson, also named Augusto, who took the family fragrance business and expanded it beyond the barbershop and out to the world. Now, Mazzolari honors both family and history with Augusto, a fresh, invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate for a gentleman of any era. Augusto opens with a tart, sparkling dose of bergamot and orange, made cool and refreshing with a spike of mint. A heart of rosewood maintains a sense of clean refinement, with geranium and lavender adding a smooth, masculine complexity. In the dry down, the depth and refinement of ambergris and sandalwood reinforce a sense of classic, understated sophistication. Equally perfect in any situation from the barbershop to the boardroom to the ballroom, Augusto is a testament to the storied history of one of our favorite houses.","bergamot, sweet orange, mint, rosewood, geranium, lavender, vetiver, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32820.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,legacy mazzolari line dates back original augusto mazzolari late 's milan barber renowned fresh bright fragrances would whip spot customers continued grandson also named augusto took family fragrance business expanded beyond barbershop world mazzolari honors family history augusto fresh invigoratingly elegant scent appropriate gentleman era augusto opens tart sparkling dose bergamot orange made cool refreshing spike mint heart rosewood maintains sense clean refinement geranium lavender adding smooth masculine complexity dry depth refinement ambergris sandalwood reinforce sense classic understated sophistication equally perfect situation barbershop boardroom ballroom augusto testament storied history one favorite houses,"bergamot, sweet orange, mint, rosewood, geranium, lavender, vetiver, amber, sandalwood"
Le Rose Eau de Parfum,Mazzolari,"Like the perfect cocktail, the perfect dress, or the perfect sunset, a perfect rose perfume need not be loud, or flashy, or bogged down by excess detail. Instead, it needs only to be pure, delicate, and true to the subtleties of the queen of all flowers. Le Rose is all of these things, a breathtakingly elegant, beautifully understated rose par excellence meant for the woman who never chases trends but instead is in complete control of her own personal style. Le Rose, as you might imagine, opens with a sole focus on rose, and this one is lusciously delicate: fresh, lightly green, natural, and rich without ever seeming overpowering. Indian sandalwood enhances the rose's woodsier and creamier aspects, while a base of sheer white musk projects a lighter-than-air sexiness that lingers for hours. Le Rose is too straightforward to have a whole bunch of tricks up its sleeve- but this beautifully simple floral proves that one perfect trick is often all you need.","rose, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/32821.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like perfect cocktail perfect dress perfect sunset perfect rose perfume need loud flashy bogged excess detail instead needs pure delicate true subtleties queen flowers le rose things breathtakingly elegant beautifully understated rose par excellence meant woman never chases trends instead complete control personal style le rose might imagine opens sole focus rose one lusciously delicate fresh lightly green natural rich without ever seeming overpowering indian sandalwood enhances rose's woodsier creamier aspects base sheer white musk projects lighter air sexiness lingers hours le rose straightforward whole bunch tricks sleeve beautifully simple floral proves one perfect trick often need,"rose, sandalwood, musk"
Pichola Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"Lake Pichola is the crown jewel and central focus of the princely city of Udaipur. A myriad of colourful historic, architectural and spiritual reflections reflect from the surface of this ancient yet manmade treasure - the sunlight and moonlight of each season bringing out the eternal and timeless beauty of the lake and the Rajasthan region
Pichola, the latest fragrance from Neela Vermeire Creations, captures this beauty and era-spanning elegance in a symphony of fresh, vibrant orange blossom, tender tuberose, sweet ylang, and tart, crisp mandarin. A princely spice blend- redolent saffron, dry cinnamon, cardamom- dance atop the citrus and flower, while a resinous woody base, sandalwood and vetiver, add a touch of deeper contrast without ever weighing down the exuberance of this magical concoction.
Like the reflections over the lake surface, constantly shifting but always reflecting the same colorful, diverse and impossibly rich city next to which it rests, Pichola is a fragrance of luxurious depth, gorgeous light, and immense character.

O/E Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo,"Like any great architect, Antonio Gardoni is obsessed with structure and balance, and the concept that any fragrance, no matter how big and complex, can stand on the head of a pin if the engineering is sound. So it should come as no surprise that O/E, Bogue Profumo's followup to last year's sensational Maai and Cologne Reloaded, is, like its predecessors, a paradox- an elaborately structured, hugely complicated edifice of bright, shining citruses, naturally green spices and florals, warm natural wood notes and sheer synthetic ones, and an underpinning of smoky animalic notes- all of which somehow lock together to form something bright, surprisingly light, and cheerfully uncategorizable. The combinations are exquisite- an ultra-fresh bergamot opening stands atop a spicy, fresh herb garden of rosemary and thyme. Balsamic camphor cools off a bough of juniper, pine and cypress. A lilt of lush florals offset a benzoin-tinged resinousness, and a transluscent layer of iso-E super wraps it all together and marks the composition as unmistakably 21st century. Each bold stroke is effortlessly complimented with the kind of artistic and architectural virtuosity that balances, but never overlaps, leaving the finished product as impressive in its scope as it is wonderfully enjoyable. Halfway between acoustic and electric, digital and analogue, artisanal and industrial, indoors and outdoors, O/E is another triumph from a truly contemporary talent.","bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66903.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like great architect antonio gardoni obsessed structure balance concept fragrance matter big complex stand head pin engineering sound come surprise o/e bogue profumo's followup last year's sensational maai cologne reloaded like predecessors paradox elaborately structured hugely complicated edifice bright shining citruses naturally green spices florals warm natural wood notes sheer synthetic ones underpinning smoky animalic notes somehow lock together form something bright surprisingly light cheerfully uncategorizable combinations exquisite ultra fresh bergamot opening stands atop spicy fresh herb garden rosemary thyme balsamic camphor cools bough juniper pine cypress lilt lush florals offset benzoin tinged resinousness transluscent layer iso e super wraps together marks composition unmistakably st century bold stroke effortlessly complimented kind artistic architectural virtuosity balances never overlaps leaving finished product impressive scope wonderfully enjoyable halfway acoustic electric digital analogue artisanal industrial indoors outdoors o/e another triumph truly contemporary talent,"bergamot, grapefruit, lemon, neroli, clove, black pepper, rosemary, thyme, camphor, lebanon cedar, juniper, pine, cypress, rose, jasmine, vetiver, benzoin, tobacco, resins, sandalwood"
Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Sticker Set,Charenton Macerations,"Limited Edition Asphalt Rainbow Scratch & Sniff Stickers.
Asphalt Rainbow draws inspiration from the ""break the rules"" attitude of global street art: a creative world movement that teaches anything can be a canvas and anyone an artist. Specifically exploring the concepts of distortion, reappropriation, and impermanence, Asphalt Rainbow borrows from a series of masterful street art techniques to craft an olfactive love letter to the street: a roughed up rose that's been hyper-colored, torn apart and twisted on its head, then nailed to the wall for your sniffing pleasure. The arc of the fragrance mirrors the unpredictable lifecycle of street art: a re-envisioned rose accord that distorts and morphs over time like a fragmented floral collage stretched across urban walls and alleyways; its aerosol-tinged aroma ever-fading closer to background.","rose absolute, rose fragments, spray paint (aerosols), galbanum, lily of the valley, lychee, ylang-ylang, saffron, magnolia, leather, cistus, asphalt, detritus, patchouli, wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,limited edition asphalt rainbow scratch sniff stickers asphalt rainbow draws inspiration break rules attitude global street art creative world movement teaches anything canvas anyone artist specifically exploring concepts distortion reappropriation impermanence asphalt rainbow borrows series masterful street art techniques craft olfactive love letter street roughed rose that's hyper colored torn apart twisted head nailed wall sniffing pleasure arc fragrance mirrors unpredictable lifecycle street art envisioned rose accord distorts morphs time like fragmented floral collage stretched across urban walls alleyways aerosol tinged aroma ever fading closer background,"rose absolute, rose fragments, spray paint (aerosols), galbanum, lily valley, lychee, ylang-ylang, saffron, magnolia, leather, cistus, asphalt, detritus, patchouli, wood, amber"
Asphalt Rainbow Eau de Parfum,Charenton Macerations,"Asphalt Rainbow, a tribute to the creativity, spontaneity and political bravery of modern urban street art, succeeds in much the same way that its predecessor Christopher Street did: it's a high-concept, passionate, literate fragrance that, at the end of the day, smells both unique and just plain good. Drawing on the concepts of distortion, reappropriation and impermanence that inform street artists from Blek le Rat to Retna, Asphalt Rainbow takes a universally known perfume note- the rose- and puts it through an impressive bag of artists' tricks, presenting a rose that seems both unnaturally vivid but also surprisingly well-structured, as if stenciled with day-glo spraypaint. A distinct aerosol note lingers above it, and quickly a whole modern cityscape follows- damp pavement, auto exhaust, street food, brick walls, and the fleeting scents of a million strangers brushing past one another in a hurry to anywhere but where they are at this exact moment. That rose brings us back for sniff after sniff, daring us to separate it from the city on whose back it lives, until we realize that we can't- that the city and the flower are one and the same, faded into one another. Fresh, captivating, distinctly modern and urban, Asphalt Rainbow is not only a worthy follow-up to Christopher Street, but also confirmation that Charenton Macerations is a house of true skill and vision.","rose absolute, rose fragments, galbanum, lily of the valley, lychee, ylang-ylang, saffron, magnolia, leather, cistus, asphalt, patchouli, wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,asphalt rainbow tribute creativity spontaneity political bravery modern urban street art succeeds much way predecessor christopher street high concept passionate literate fragrance end day smells unique plain good drawing concepts distortion reappropriation impermanence inform street artists blek le rat retna asphalt rainbow takes universally known perfume note rose puts impressive bag artists' tricks presenting rose seems unnaturally vivid also surprisingly well structured stenciled day glo spraypaint distinct aerosol note lingers quickly whole modern cityscape follows damp pavement auto exhaust street food brick walls fleeting scents million strangers brushing past one another hurry anywhere exact moment rose brings us back sniff sniff daring us separate city whose back lives realize can't city flower one faded one another fresh captivating distinctly modern urban asphalt rainbow worthy follow christopher street also confirmation charenton macerations house true skill vision,"rose absolute, rose fragments, galbanum, lily valley, lychee, ylang-ylang, saffron, magnolia, leather, cistus, asphalt, patchouli, wood, amber"
Cristallo di Rocca Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo,"Rock crystal (also known as quartz) has long captured human imagination not in spite of its unadulterated beauty, but because of it: as one of the earliest forms of jewelry, its striking clarity and natural facets made it a prized accessory long before modern gemstone cutting and polishing methods came into vogue. Cristallo di Rocca pays tribute to this treasured material in full, with a clear, beautifully balanced scent that weaves fresh, clean floral beauty in with a striking mineralic spice blend for an olfactory experience that truly mirrors the intended subject. Like noticing a strikingly clear stone for the first time, Cristallo di Roca opens fresh, bright and clean, with a crisp citrus and delicate floral blend. The gently spicy heart, made up of clove, iris and intriguingly sweet notes of rum and almond, feel wonderfully tactile, as if the edges of the crystal haven't yet been polished into complete conformity, but sparkle nonetheless. A soft base of sandalwood and creamy vanilla is like the exquisite but understated setting, providing sophisticated contrast. Like your fragrance, your jewelry of choice makes a statement about your character. Cristallo di Rocca identifies the wearer, on both counts, as someone for whom individuality coexists perfectly with elegance.","almond, citrus, lily of the valley, rose, geranium, ylang-ylang, cloves, rum, iris, sandalwood, vanilla, rock crystal",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rock crystal also known quartz long captured human imagination spite unadulterated beauty one earliest forms jewelry striking clarity natural facets made prized accessory long modern gemstone cutting polishing methods came vogue cristallo di rocca pays tribute treasured material full clear beautifully balanced scent weaves fresh clean floral beauty striking mineralic spice blend olfactory experience truly mirrors intended subject like noticing strikingly clear stone first time cristallo di roca opens fresh bright clean crisp citrus delicate floral blend gently spicy heart made clove iris intriguingly sweet notes rum almond feel wonderfully tactile edges crystal yet polished complete conformity sparkle nonetheless soft base sandalwood creamy vanilla like exquisite understated setting providing sophisticated contrast like fragrance jewelry choice makes statement character cristallo di rocca identifies wearer counts someone individuality coexists perfectly elegance,"almond, citrus, lily valley, rose, geranium, ylang-ylang, cloves, rum, iris, sandalwood, vanilla, rock crystal"

Black Muscs Eau de Parfum,Alexandre. J,"While plenty of fragrances use ""Black"" in the title to convey intense woods, or fierce, challenging animalics, Black Muscs, with its subtly sensational blend of citrus, lightly floral muskiness, and resonant amber, is far more aligned to the elegant universality of the color- more like a finely tailored tuxedo than a horror movie monster. Opening with a fresh bergamot and lemon blend, transitioning with a lovely rose and patchouli heart, and ultimately settling into a deep, confident amber-and-musk drydown pitched at just the right volume, Black Muscs is a perfect scent for anyone that carries themselves with dignity, but never lets it lapse into self-seriousness.

Christopher Street Eau de Parfum,Charenton Macerations,"Home to merchants and misfits, Beatniks and Bohemians, dissidents and protesters, New York City's Christopher Street has established a reputation for celebrating rugged and rebellious individualism. Like the unique architecture of the street's triangular-shaped Northern Dispensary, Christopher Street introduces a distinctive fragrance structure that challenges traditional olfactive notions of gender. Unlike unisex fragrances that target a lowest common denominator (i.e. choosing the least offensive, neutered ingredients for formulation), Christopher Street revels in the unexpected harmonies of its strong masculine and feminine notes. The fragrance combines classical floral chypre elements with more subversive tones of metals, smoky tobacco, watered down alcohol, wet woods and clove.","alcoholic lime, bergamot, bitter orange, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove bud, orange blossom, poet carnation, incense, moss, musk, myrrh, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,home merchants misfits beatniks bohemians dissidents protesters new york city's christopher street established reputation celebrating rugged rebellious individualism like unique architecture street's triangular shaped northern dispensary christopher street introduces distinctive fragrance structure challenges traditional olfactive notions gender unlike unisex fragrances target lowest common denominator e choosing least offensive neutered ingredients formulation christopher street revels unexpected harmonies strong masculine feminine notes fragrance combines classical floral chypre elements subversive tones metals smoky tobacco watered alcohol wet woods clove,"alcoholic lime, bergamot, bitter orange, leather, tobacco, cinnamon, clove bud, orange blossom, poet carnation, incense, moss, musk, myrrh, patchouli"
Rudis Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942,"In ancient Rome, the ârudisâ was the wooden practice sword of a gladiator, worn into the arena as a symbol of his strength and valor. With Rudis, Nobile 1942 brings us a full portrait of one such ancient warrior, garbed in hardened leather armor, his sword adorned with flowers for courage and luck, fortified with wine and spirits for the battle that awaits.
Rudis opens with an opulent blend of whiskey and leather, infused with tart fruits, smoky wood, buttery saffron, and the golden sweetness of immortelle. The leather feels as supple as expensive calfskin, but its luxuriousness has a sensual side from the musk and ambered warmth. A streak of red wine runs through the base, alongside roses redolent with patchouli and spice, balancing the raw masculinity of the opening notes and making Rudis feel both unisex and surprisingly modern. Sweet and spicy, golden and creamy, smoky and earthy, Rudis is an utterly intoxicating stitch in time connecting Europe's past, present, and future in an undeniably captivating fragrance.","bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52312.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ancient rome rudis wooden practice sword gladiator worn arena symbol strength valor rudis nobile brings us full portrait one ancient warrior garbed hardened leather armor sword adorned flowers courage luck fortified wine spirits battle awaits rudis opens opulent blend whiskey leather infused tart fruits smoky wood buttery saffron golden sweetness immortelle leather feels supple expensive calfskin luxuriousness sensual side musk ambered warmth streak red wine runs base alongside roses redolent patchouli spice balancing raw masculinity opening notes making rudis feel unisex surprisingly modern sweet spicy golden creamy smoky earthy rudis utterly intoxicating stitch time connecting europe's past present future undeniably captivating fragrance,"bergamot, dried fruits, rose, geranium, clove, saffron, cedar wood, leathery notes, patchouli, vetiver, immortelle, musk incense"

Maai Eau de Parfum,Bogue Profumo,"Maai is a stunning accomplishment in modern perfumery as it marries the very best of old-school chypre glamour and bold animalics with a refined elegance and smoothness. It opens with a burst of incredibly mossy greenness, fused with roses, jasmine, and green tuberose, all sprinkled with a transparent veil of golden, glittering aldehydes. The plush bouquet is mesmerizing in its depth, and harkens back to a time before IFRA/EU regulations, but it's truly heart-stopping when combined with the animalic elements. Musky, leathered, and skanky, they cast a mighty roar that transforms the delicate swirl of feminine florals into something more unisex with a masculine touch that will appeal to fans of the legendary Kouros or Muscs Koublai Khan. As Maai unfolds, balsamic resins awaken in the base to add subtle streaks of smokiness and honeyed sweetness. At the same time, the amber slowly turns the whole fragrance deeper, richer, and softer, coating the musky leather in its warmth and taming its skanky cry. In its drydown, Maai transforms into golden velvet with a smooth, plush mix of amber, musk, and oakmoss.
We found Maai to be one of the boldest, most sophisticated chypres we've encountered in a while. A symphonic masterpiece in the vein of Jubilation 25 and Kouros, it is not a fragrance for the faint of heart but for those who have mourned the loss of vintage glamour with an animalic edge. Black-tie galas seem like a perfect occasion for this incredibly opulent, concentrated scent, but so are moments when you want to seduce with naked sensuality. Maai's unconventional heart beats with such wildness and passion, it feel almost alive. Yet, at the end of the day, everything pales before that luxurious oakmoss which is piled on in such lavish layers that it took our breath away. Maai is the epitome of sophistication in the grandest tradition of haute perfumery, and we're sure its timeless beauty will impress even the most jaded connoisseur.","tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,maai stunning accomplishment modern perfumery marries best old school chypre glamour bold animalics refined elegance smoothness opens burst incredibly mossy greenness fused roses jasmine green tuberose sprinkled transparent veil golden glittering aldehydes plush bouquet mesmerizing depth harkens back time ifra/eu regulations truly heart stopping combined animalic elements musky leathered skanky cast mighty roar transforms delicate swirl feminine florals something unisex masculine touch appeal fans legendary kouros muscs koublai khan maai unfolds balsamic resins awaken base add subtle streaks smokiness honeyed sweetness time amber slowly turns whole fragrance deeper richer softer coating musky leather warmth taming skanky cry drydown maai transforms golden velvet smooth plush mix amber musk oakmoss found maai one boldest sophisticated chypres we've encountered symphonic masterpiece vein jubilation kouros fragrance faint heart mourned loss vintage glamour animalic edge black tie galas seem like perfect occasion incredibly opulent concentrated scent moments want seduce naked sensuality maai's unconventional heart beats wildness passion feel almost alive yet end day everything pales luxurious oakmoss piled lavish layers took breath away maai epitome sophistication grandest tradition haute perfumery we're sure timeless beauty impress even jaded connoisseur,"tuberose, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, civet, castoreum, hyraceum, dried fruits, sandalwood, oakmoss"
SHE Shihan Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki,"If Piotr Czarnecki's instant cult hit Shihan (formerly called Sensei) was an ode to the perfumer's roots as a professional ballroom dancer- sensual, balanced, and unexpectedly muscular- then SHE Shihan could rightfully be thought of as an even more elegant, unabashedly feminine ballet. Building from the original's unisex oriental gourmand notes of tobacco, whiskey, vanilla and spices, SHE Shihan glides confidently into the world of women's scent, adding a sweet, fresh garden rose to the still beguilingly spiced opening. In the heart of the fragrance, the original's myrrh and frankincense are rounded out with an exquisite, slightly chocolately plum and floral notes of violet and rose petal. While the drydown still features a sweet, shimmering labdanum and ambrette base, the addition of extra vanilla keeps SHE Shihan carefully walking the line between classically rich and surprisingly sexy.
No matter what aspect of this gracefully sweet, gorgeously captivating fragrance appeals the most, we're positive that Piotr Czarnecki has yet again stolen our hearts.","plum, violet, rose, tobacco, incense, spices, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,piotr czarnecki's instant cult hit shihan formerly called sensei ode perfumer's roots professional ballroom dancer sensual balanced unexpectedly muscular shihan could rightfully thought even elegant unabashedly feminine ballet building original's unisex oriental gourmand notes tobacco whiskey vanilla spices shihan glides confidently world women's scent adding sweet fresh garden rose still beguilingly spiced opening heart fragrance original's myrrh frankincense rounded exquisite slightly chocolately plum floral notes violet rose petal drydown still features sweet shimmering labdanum ambrette base addition extra vanilla keeps shihan carefully walking line classically rich surprisingly sexy matter aspect gracefully sweet gorgeously captivating fragrance appeals we're positive piotr czarnecki yet stolen hearts,"plum, violet, rose, tobacco, incense, spices, vanilla"
Mood Indigo Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit,"For Mood Indigo, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Michel Gondry's film, ""L'ecume des Jours"" (Mood Indigo):
""For me the film L'ÃCUME DES JOURS as a whole was carried by Jazz music; I like this ambiance. The flowers play a strong role (water lily) the film which starts gay and luminous turns and becomes very dark! The fragrance is based on dark woody notes with a lot of incense, which represents the Jazz music for me. There is a short passage in the fragrance, where you smell the light, bright water lily.

Love Exposure Eau de Parfum,Moth and Rabbit,"Le Cinema Olfactif is a creative collaboration between the Soho House and La Folie A Plusieurs that brings together the mediums of cinema and perfumery to create a new form of sensory engagement. Exclusively designed for the Soho House Cinema Program, for select screenings an internationally renowned perfumer is invited to create a scent inspired by his or her personal response to a moment in a film. The scent is then incorporated into the viewer experience during the film screening. For Love Exposure, perfumer Mark Buxton was inspired by Sion Sono's film by the same name:
""I was inspired by the films mixture of love, lust, violence, sex and religion. A story told with a certain kind of humor and tension that builds up and leads you to an unforeseeable ending. â love. A delicate floral scent, somehow innocent, but heady and strong at the same time. â lust. Clean, but kinky animal notes which run through the scent like a red thread; costus, indol and cumin and ambergris. â violence. The surprising bloody note from the bucchu oil, bay and metallic notes. â sex. A smell of hot wet skin communicated through a mixture of musk, vanilla and sandalwood. And â religion.

A stunningly different interpretation of the majestic rose.
""Anthropomorphised throughout literature and poetry the illustrious rose is immortally bound to its sweet, old fashioned and pretty stereotype.

Cascades of French mimosa, osmanthus and white champac are woven between the powdered, violet facets of precious orris. Virginian cedarwood and subtle notes of frankincense bring an ethereal light and delicate freshness to this tender composition.
""Inspiration for my perfumes comes to me in many ways, but none more so than from the nature in my own garden.

2022 Generation Homme Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"2022 represents an important year for the future of the Middle East: as Qatar will play host to the World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon a great gathering in the heart of the region, an event that, at best, has the potential to demonstrate true sharing among more developed nations and states that are still struggling. Against this backdrop, Stephane Humbert Lucas presents 2022 Generation Man, a fragrance that employs a unique blend of timeless opulence and sleek modernity to represent the distinct character of today's sophisticated Middle Eastern man.
2022 Generation Man opens with an unexpectedly bright burst of juicy blackcurrant and zesty yuzu, kept cool with a spritz of fresh mint. It's a wonderful twist for those expecting a by-the-numbers oud and spices, establishing a portrait of a modern young Middle Easterner prepared to greet the global community with as much style and warmth as imposing sophistication. The oud, of course, is present; a fabulously rich heart made from prized Cambodian agarwood of such rare distinction that it can hardly be compared to the synthetically sharp or pungently sour ouds of lesser brands. This is an oud that asserts its own value, dry and distinguished, powerful and almost translucent, connecting the fragrance to an unbroken line of tradition without ever dragging the composition backwards. As a base of rich spices and warm balsamic musk swell in support, the timeless luxury of Middle Eastern perfumery blends seamlessly with modern creativity for a sexy, sophisticated scent any man could wear with confidence. Presented in a beautiful black lacquered bottle with a handcrafted gold cap, 2022 Generation Man is more than just a striking fragrance; it's a masterful statement.","yuzu, blackcurrant, mint, oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,represents important year future middle east qatar play host world cup eyes world upon great gathering heart region event best potential demonstrate true sharing among developed nations states still struggling backdrop stephane humbert lucas presents generation man fragrance employs unique blend timeless opulence sleek modernity represent distinct character today's sophisticated middle eastern man generation man opens unexpectedly bright burst juicy blackcurrant zesty yuzu kept cool spritz fresh mint wonderful twist expecting numbers oud spices establishing portrait modern young middle easterner prepared greet global community much style warmth imposing sophistication oud course present fabulously rich heart made prized cambodian agarwood rare distinction hardly compared synthetically sharp pungently sour ouds lesser brands oud asserts value dry distinguished powerful almost translucent connecting fragrance unbroken line tradition without ever dragging composition backwards base rich spices warm balsamic musk swell support timeless luxury middle eastern perfumery blends seamlessly modern creativity sexy sophisticated scent man could wear confidence presented beautiful black lacquered bottle handcrafted gold cap generation man striking fragrance masterful statement,"yuzu, blackcurrant, mint, oud, precious oud, spices, balsamic notes"
Shihan Eau de Parfum,Piotr Czarnecki,"A personal labor of love, Shihan is Piotr Czarnecki's tribute to the natural connection between fragrance and dance. As a professional ballroom dancer and dance instructor in his native Poland, Czarnecki had long employed a lifetime obsession with scentmaking to compose fragrances meant to accompany his routines and those of his students, to, in his words, ""create their own atmosphere."" But while it may have been originally created for a select few students, Shihan, a warm, exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand, is simply too good to keep secret. As with a finely crafted dance program, his fragrance (formerly called Sensei) weaves around its central composition with graceful fluidity, revealing wondrous new aspects with each passing moment. The foundation of exceptionally high quality, largely natural ingredients: in the opening, Cuban tobacco and bitter Arabic coffee lend earthy depth to a boozy warm whiskey accord, while colonial spices enliven a mysterious heart of frankincense and myrrh, evoking visions of grand, exotic opulence. A musky amber base purrs with carefully extracted labdanum and sweet ambrette, dreamily resinous.
A perfect blend of lively spice and warm richness that will delight fans of gourmands and orientals alike.","whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/66000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,personal labor love shihan piotr czarnecki's tribute natural connection fragrance dance professional ballroom dancer dance instructor native poland czarnecki long employed lifetime obsession scentmaking compose fragrances meant accompany routines students words create atmosphere may originally created select students shihan warm exquisitely balanced oriental gourmand simply good keep secret finely crafted dance program fragrance formerly called sensei weaves around central composition graceful fluidity revealing wondrous new aspects passing moment foundation exceptionally high quality largely natural ingredients opening cuban tobacco bitter arabic coffee lend earthy depth boozy warm whiskey accord colonial spices enliven mysterious heart frankincense myrrh evoking visions grand exotic opulence musky amber base purrs carefully extracted labdanum sweet ambrette dreamily resinous perfect blend lively spice warm richness delight fans gourmands orientals alike,"whiskey, coffee, tobacco, pepper, cinnamon, incense, myrrh, spicy accord, ambrette, labdanum, benzoin, amber musk"
Black Gemstone Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"A fragrance named for the sacred cornerstone of the very center of the Grand Mosque of Mecca demands a refinement and respect for both subject and composition. But StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is no mere tourist, and Black Gemstone, through its captivatingly complex blend of myrrh, lemon and smoky incense, indeed inspires a profound respect bordering on wonderment.
The Black Stone of Mecca is purported to have fallen directly from Heaven, and the ingredients of Black Gemstone are clearly intended to come as close to otherworldly as possible. Pristinely tart Italian lemon, rich Olibanum-derived incense and three hand-selected types of cedar are but a few of the treasured components, but the true centerpiece is an extraordinary myrrh, painstakingly distilled down into a resinous tar that, like the Black Stone itself, projects a presence that far exceeds its size. And like a true religious experience, Black Gemstone follows no linear path- from moment to the moment, the tartness of the lemon, smokiness of the incense and balsamic sweetness of the myrrh dance around one another with an unpredictability that promises to make each individual encounter profoundly unique.
Presented in an elegantly understated black lacquered bottle, with a unique hand-milled black honeycomb top and a small faceted black Swarovski crystal.

Oumma Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas describes Oumma as a study of the contrasts of agarwood (oud), a substance he views with mystical reverence. A single sniff of Oumma can more than explain why: based around the finest Burmese oud and buttressed by Moroccan Rose, Egyptian jasmine and Peruvian Balsam, this fragrance is drawn from the rarest sources on the planet and yet, it hardly feels earthly at all. Instead, Oumma seems to rise from the ground, stretching out each extraordinary facet of its central ingredient until the smoky, spicy wood and subtly sharp, medicinal aphrodisiac properties that make up the duality of oud seem to exist simultaneously, suspended in mid-air. Simply put, Oumma is a fragrance that makes you look to the heavens.
A dry, spicy rose and elegantly savory saffron hover beneath, but this is nothing like the lavish-yet-rote oud-rose pairings widely available elsewhere. Rather, these exceptional ingredients, each deserving of a starring role in a different composition, combine with smoke-saturated cade ash to build the earthly pyre from which this singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher.
Even the bottle itself seems prepared to leave the ground: shiny and silver, as bright and reflective as the mid-day sky, finished with a polished silver cap and a Swarovski diamond placed on the crown. We've never experienced an oud quite like this.","jasmine, rose, balsam, balsam tolu, ashes cade, oud, nagarmotha",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,st phane humbert lucas describes oumma study contrasts agarwood oud substance views mystical reverence single sniff oumma explain based around finest burmese oud buttressed moroccan rose egyptian jasmine peruvian balsam fragrance drawn rarest sources planet yet hardly feels earthly instead oumma seems rise ground stretching extraordinary facet central ingredient smoky spicy wood subtly sharp medicinal aphrodisiac properties make duality oud seem exist simultaneously suspended mid air simply put oumma fragrance makes look heavens dry spicy rose elegantly savory saffron hover beneath nothing like lavish yet rote oud rose pairings widely available elsewhere rather exceptional ingredients deserving starring role different composition combine smoke saturated cade ash build earthly pyre singularly extraordinary oud might ascend even higher even bottle seems prepared leave ground shiny silver bright reflective mid day sky finished polished silver cap swarovski diamond placed crown we've never experienced oud quite like,"jasmine, rose, balsam, balsam tolu, ashes cade, oud, nagarmotha"
Rose de Petra Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"Petra: capital of the Nabataeans, a wonder of ancient engineering, an ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely into the side of the mountain thought to be the biblical Sinai itself. Words cannot hope to describe the majesty of the place known as the Rose City, but StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose a far more appropriate medium with Rose de Petra, a breathtaking floral that honors both halves of its namesake with a rose equal parts refreshingly natural and sumptuously mysterious. We like to think of Rose de Petra as a journey down an ancient stone canyon, with wild roses in full bloom springing from every crack in the rock. What begins as a simple, beautiful journey opens itself to mystery and wonder- that clean, bright rose we smell is no single, simple note but rather an intense rose oxide given body and mouthwatering juiciness from pomegranate and litchi. As the heart of pure, natural Bulgarian rose expands, so too do the spices- cardamom, cumin and pepper, intense enough to invigorate but light enough to place this scent a world away from a typical rose chypre. Here, yet again, we see the necessity of Lucas' uncompromising commitment to top quality ingredients, as Rose de Petra's deceptively simple formula belies an astounding integrity we would not have thought possible from reading the notes alone. Like a fully irrigated city carved into a mountain in the middle of the desert, Rose de Petra is a masterpiece of construction that will knock you over with its beauty.
Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal placed on the crown.","rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,petra capital nabataeans wonder ancient engineering ornately beautiful kingdom carved entirely side mountain thought biblical sinai words cannot hope describe majesty place known rose city st phane humbert lucas chose far appropriate medium rose de petra breathtaking floral honors halves namesake rose equal parts refreshingly natural sumptuously mysterious like think rose de petra journey ancient stone canyon wild roses full bloom springing every crack rock begins simple beautiful journey opens mystery wonder clean bright rose smell single simple note rather intense rose oxide given body mouthwatering juiciness pomegranate litchi heart pure natural bulgarian rose expands spices cardamom cumin pepper intense enough invigorate light enough place scent world away typical rose chypre yet see necessity lucas' uncompromising commitment top quality ingredients rose de petra's deceptively simple formula belies astounding integrity would thought possible reading notes alone like fully irrigated city carved mountain middle desert rose de petra masterpiece construction knock beauty presented genuine gold lettered transparent bottle adorned unique hand milled gold honeycomb top small faceted peach colored swarovski crystal placed crown,"rose oxide, pomegranate, litchi, rose, pepper, cardamom, cumin seeds"
Soleil de Jeddah Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"Few places on the planet have a closer relationship to the sun than the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah, the Bride of the Red Sea, gateway to Mecca and Medina. To honor a great city that is both religious epicenter and vacation destination, cultural capital and center of commerce, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas chose to focus the one element equally present and central to all endeavors, and contained within the brilliant gold-metallic bottle is a sun-drenched, rapturously bright citrus-floral that gradually evolves to reveal hidden depths of Russian leather, Madagascar vanilla, buttery iris, and earthy amber. Like the multi-faceted city of Jeddah itself, the reasons for going and the reasons for staying may be entirely different. The initial brightness of Soleil de Jeddah is a thing of unapologetic beauty: tart, juicy lemon, pillow-soft Roman chamomile, and an exquisite osmanthus so mouthwateringly jammy that we've variously detected peach, apricot, lychee, and mango, albeit without any of the cloying sweetness that might accompany any of those notes in a lesser fragrance. In fact, for a fragrance this big and bright, it's a minor miracle that Soleil de Jeddah never deviates into reductive sweetness or overdone sour, which we can only attribute to the exceptional quality of the ingredients, as well as a lightly powdery iris root heart that seamlessly bridges the gap into the earthier, surprisingly sensual base. Once the Russian leather emerges, rich and resinous with a very slight smokiness, what might have seemed like a strange and unfamiliar progression is now natural, intriguing, and deeply satisfying. Like the beautiful, hand-milled golden honeycombed cap, the Jeddah sun shines brightly enough to bring everything together, with undeniably beautiful results.","lemon, chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, leather, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,places planet closer relationship sun saudi arabian city jeddah bride red sea gateway mecca medina honor great city religious epicenter vacation destination cultural capital center commerce st phane humbert lucas chose focus one element equally present central endeavors contained within brilliant gold metallic bottle sun drenched rapturously bright citrus floral gradually evolves reveal hidden depths russian leather madagascar vanilla buttery iris earthy amber like multi faceted city jeddah reasons going reasons staying may entirely different initial brightness soleil de jeddah thing unapologetic beauty tart juicy lemon pillow soft roman chamomile exquisite osmanthus mouthwateringly jammy we've variously detected peach apricot lychee mango albeit without cloying sweetness might accompany notes lesser fragrance fact fragrance big bright minor miracle soleil de jeddah never deviates reductive sweetness overdone sour attribute exceptional quality ingredients well lightly powdery iris root heart seamlessly bridges gap earthier surprisingly sensual base russian leather emerges rich resinous slight smokiness might seemed like strange unfamiliar progression natural intriguing deeply satisfying like beautiful hand milled golden honeycombed cap jeddah sun shines brightly enough bring everything together undeniably beautiful results,"lemon, chamomile, osmanthus, iris root, amber, earthy notes, iris butter, leather, vanilla"
Khol de Bahrein Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"KhÃ´l: one of the world's earliest cosmetics and the essence of ancient beauty. Think Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra, immaculate jet-black lines of khÃ´l framing piercing violet eyes, infusing what was already stunning with near-mystical seductive power. KhÃ´l de Bahrein is a tribute to the elegance and ingenuity of the ancient world, where the untold balsamic depths of a sumptuous amber-benzene heart frame a strikingly lovely violet and iris led floral with masterful precision.
KhÃ´l de Bahrein opens with complimentary waves of deep, resinous amber and an iris both richly earthy and subtly sweet. As the iris evolves to an almost candied sweetness, the violet and ambergris weave seamlessly in, lending a powdery softness that anchors without ever diluting. It is an exquisite balancing act achievable only with the finest natural iris and ambergris, highest-quality ingredients that also result in a projection and longevity impossible with mundane synthetics.
Presented in a genuine gold-lettered transparent bottle, adorned with a unique hand-milled gold honeycomb top and a small faceted peach-colored Swarovski crystal, KhÃ´l de Bahrein is that rarest of treasures: a celebration of timeless beauty that proves itself equally beautiful, inside and out.","violet, nougat, gums, iris powder, sandalwood, benzoin, amber, musky balsamic notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kh l one world's earliest cosmetics essence ancient beauty think elizabeth taylor cleopatra immaculate jet black lines kh l framing piercing violet eyes infusing already stunning near mystical seductive power kh l de bahrein tribute elegance ingenuity ancient world untold balsamic depths sumptuous amber benzene heart frame strikingly lovely violet iris led floral masterful precision kh l de bahrein opens complimentary waves deep resinous amber iris richly earthy subtly sweet iris evolves almost candied sweetness violet ambergris weave seamlessly lending powdery softness anchors without ever diluting exquisite balancing act achievable finest natural iris ambergris highest quality ingredients also result projection longevity impossible mundane synthetics presented genuine gold lettered transparent bottle adorned unique hand milled gold honeycomb top small faceted peach colored swarovski crystal kh l de bahrein rarest treasures celebration timeless beauty proves equally beautiful inside,"violet, nougat, gums, iris powder, sandalwood, benzoin, amber, musky balsamic notes"
O Hira Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"To say that O Hira is perhaps the finest amber fragrance in the world isn't so much a matter of opinion as it is a matter of pedigree. 777 creator and nose StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas became fixated on creating an amber scent that would spare no expense, cut no corner, in pursuit of the most precious ingredients on the globe. The process would end up taking him 2 years of dedicated work, but the result is nothing short of extraordinary: O Hira, the powerful, authentic scent of fossilized amber, a masterwork that Lucas considers ""the diamond of the collection.""
There is no fragrance pyramid in O Hira, no notes given to consider outside of fossilized amber. But hidden within the simplicity is breathtaking depth, an amber that seems to contain sweet, rich, warm, spicy, powdery and smoky all at once, the kind of amber that almost makes one wonder if they're actually smelling it for the first time. With an almost unbelievable sillage and longevity, O Hira is a true testament to uncompromising quality, an approach mirrored in the elegant, genuine platinum-lettered bottle and hand-milled silver cap.

Une Nuit a Doha Eau de Parfum,Stephane Humbert Lucas 777,"While the 777 line is dedicated to paying tribute to the great cultures and natural ingredients of the Middle East, StÃ©phane Humbert Lucas is in no way fenced in by the conventions or styles of traditional middle eastern perfumery. And we're thankful for that, because Une Nuit Doha, a soft, deliciously sweet immortelle and vanilla scent inspired by summer nights in the capital of Qatar, is nobody's idea of an indulgently rich Middle Eastern gourmand.
Instead, it glows like a hazy, dreamlike moon, calm but deep, on a city night where the intensity of the day's heat has faded but not vanished. Warm winds carry the exotic scents of night markets: fennel, ginger, crystallized mandarin, while the sweetness of the immortelle blends into a comfortable brown tobacco from the neighborhood cafes, where games and conversations amongst old men run late into the night. As the base of creamy, beautiful vanilla absolute begins to warm, the fragrance hugs closer to the skin, drawing people together as the desert night seems to stretch on into eternity. This is seduction for adults- calm, assured, and utterly lovely.

Magnolia Grandiflora - Sandrine Eau de Parfum,Grandiflora,"Perfume lovers have long admired the author of the fiercely original Manoumalia, Sandrine Videault, a maverick artist who chose to work only on compositions she believed in, hence her tiny commercial production. Sandrine left us last year at a tragically early age. Her last gift to us, and to the Australian floral designer Saskia Havekes, whose soul and world Sandrine fell in love with, is her Magnolia Grandiflora.
Magnolia Grandiflora Sandrine is part of a pair of fragrances, both dedicated to Grandiflora's namesake blossom. An unusual debut for a fledgling brand, but a vibrant, emotional tribute to the story behind the scents, since the other magnolia was composed by Michel Roudnitska, the son of Sandrine's mentors, Edmond and ThÃ©rÃ¨se.
While Michel's magnolia is lush and sensuous, this fragrance captures magnolia on a summer morning in its first, luminous stage: a dewy rose-tinged bud, shimmering with the tangy zest of a grapefruit note. âIt's probably the first time I detect a chypre accord in the flowerâ, Sandrine wrote. âI didn't know it existed in nature. For me, it was the most important thing to say about this Magnolia.

Vani Choc Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Vani Choc opens with a sparkling burst of lemon and bergamot, like fresh zested rind stirred into a bowl of vanilla, cream, and sugar.

Tendre est la Nuit Eau de Parfum,Majda Bekkali,"Soft, aromatic, and animalic, Tendre est la Nuit evokes a cozy and sweet atmosphere that may result in indolence and languor. Majda Bekkali wanted to tell what may be the opposite of the noisy and turbulent world where we live...but when we extract ourselves from the noisy world, some danger lurks around and reason falters, the animality emerges. An homage to Zelda Fitzgerald (wife of F. Scott) who not only hid in the shadows of her husband, but also in her own cocoon of madness, Tendre Est La Nuit is a scent that references darkness' magnetic appeal and the sweet idleness of a wandering mind.
Created with perfumer Delphine Thierry, the top notes of immortelle flower and ambrette resemble the intoxication of GewÃ rztraminer wine; herbaceous davana and bright pepper notes serve as a lovely contrast to the mahogany, incense, and animalic notes that make an impression of danger that lurks around in the shadows of the night.","immortelle, ambrette carrot seeds, cabreuva, davana, pepper, sichuan pepper, benzoin, leather, labdanum, oakmoss, incense, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,soft aromatic animalic tendre est la nuit evokes cozy sweet atmosphere may result indolence languor majda bekkali wanted tell may opposite noisy turbulent world live extract noisy world danger lurks around reason falters animality emerges homage zelda fitzgerald wife f scott hid shadows husband also cocoon madness tendre est la nuit scent references darkness' magnetic appeal sweet idleness wandering mind created perfumer delphine thierry top notes immortelle flower ambrette resemble intoxication gew rztraminer wine herbaceous davana bright pepper notes serve lovely contrast mahogany incense animalic notes make impression danger lurks around shadows night,"immortelle, ambrette carrot seeds, cabreuva, davana, pepper, sichuan pepper, benzoin, leather, labdanum, oakmoss, incense, patchouli, castoreum"
Monsieur Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection,"Monsieur is inspired by the exploration of a forest, where torrents and waterfalls from Auvergne's mountains carry along scents of moss, bark, wood, earth, and stone. A harmonious blend of eight woody notes entwined with crushed leaves splashed by the mineral freshness of water spurting out of the rock. Monsieur is a powerful, complex, and vibrant scent permeated with an organic sensuality. It is both dry and green, mixing elements of grass, earth, crisp air currents, and damp stones. Vetiver lovers will savor the soil-caked purity of the scent and wood aficionados will appreciate the elegant blend of poplar, cedar, and sandalwood - a true harmony of the forest in a fragrance.","patchouli, cedarwood, vetiver sandalwood, absolute poplar, oakmoss, incense wood papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,monsieur inspired exploration forest torrents waterfalls auvergne's mountains carry along scents moss bark wood earth stone harmonious blend eight woody notes entwined crushed leaves splashed mineral freshness water spurting rock monsieur powerful complex vibrant scent permeated organic sensuality dry green mixing elements grass earth crisp air currents damp stones vetiver lovers savor soil caked purity scent wood aficionados appreciate elegant blend poplar cedar sandalwood true harmony forest fragrance,"patchouli, cedarwood, vetiver sandalwood, absolute poplar, oakmoss, incense wood papyrus"
Ashoka Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"Inspired by a legendary ruler, Neela Vermeire's Ashoka, is a tribute to an emperor who was conquered by his own compassion at the moment his victory was assured. He converted to Buddhism and devoted the rest of his life to spreading the Buddha's teachings, to truth, to justice and to compassion for all living creatures beneath the sun. His own evolution from ruthless conqueror to benevolent emperor is reflected in Ashoka's journey from the fierce opening to a softly floral heart & the gentle embrace of its richly complex dry down.
Ashoka is many things at once - it melds green, milky, earthy, and watery floral notes into one enticing and multifaceted scent. The opening is a refreshing fig leaf, hyacinth, and lotus - but as soon as you think that the scent is all watery and green, the creamy and earthy personality capture you like quicksand - pulling you in and helping you discover fig milk, osmanthus, heliotrope, sandalwood, and a hint of vanilla. These notes provide a velvety lactic quality that is altogether unexpected and totally irresistible. The polarities of water and milk are not only perfectly balanced, but also enhanced and expanded by exotic florals of yang-ylang and jasmine, and grounding and robust notes of leather and vetiver. Ashoka is a brilliant scent for both men and women looking for a complex yet comforting scent to be worn year-round.","lotus, rose, water hyacinth, fig leaf, parsley leaf, osmanthus absolute, cassie absolute, iris, incense essence, jasmine sambac, fig milk, geranium, ylang-ylang, fir balsam absolute, myrrh, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla accord, ambre gris, birch, vetiver, leather, styrax, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56504.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired legendary ruler neela vermeire's ashoka tribute emperor conquered compassion moment victory assured converted buddhism devoted rest life spreading buddha's teachings truth justice compassion living creatures beneath sun evolution ruthless conqueror benevolent emperor reflected ashoka's journey fierce opening softly floral heart gentle embrace richly complex dry ashoka many things melds green milky earthy watery floral notes one enticing multifaceted scent opening refreshing fig leaf hyacinth lotus soon think scent watery green creamy earthy personality capture like quicksand pulling helping discover fig milk osmanthus heliotrope sandalwood hint vanilla notes provide velvety lactic quality altogether unexpected totally irresistible polarities water milk perfectly balanced also enhanced expanded exotic florals yang ylang jasmine grounding robust notes leather vetiver ashoka brilliant scent men women looking complex yet comforting scent worn year round,"lotus, rose, water hyacinth, fig leaf, parsley leaf, osmanthus absolute, cassie absolute, iris, incense essence, jasmine sambac, fig milk, geranium, ylang-ylang, fir balsam absolute, myrrh, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla accord, ambre gris, birch, vetiver, leather, styrax, heliotrope"
Cologne Absolute Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"As the name would suggest, Cologne Absolute is Tom Daxon's take on a classic cologne, a fragrance at once supremely respectful of tradition and not at all beholden to it. A beautifully rendered vision of soaring neroli layered with tart citrus, sharp aromatics and soft white flowers over an earthy base of patchouli and cypriol, Cologne Absolute conjures up the delightful feel of a jaunt to Italy in summertime; an easy, relaxed well-being that brightens and invigorates.

Sicilian Wood Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"Inspired by the scent of a citrus grove warming in the sun, Sicilian Wood is a quintessential Tom Daxon fragrance: powerfully evocative, fascinating in its evolution and, ultimately, equal parts surprising and satisfying. The opening is a vivid citrus that is instantly captivating. The blend of lemon, tangerine and bergamot is startlingly realistic â you can feel that little squirt of juice as you peel off the skin of a tangerine. There is a hint of sweetness â like freshly-squeezed orange juice â as we move to a blend of gentle lily of the valley and jasmine. Then strong, resolute cedar and sandalwood appear and the soul of the fragrance is revealed: rich, confident wood with a twist of citrus.","lemon, tangerine, bergamot, cardamom, gaiac wood, jasmine, lily of the valley, amber cedarwood, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired scent citrus grove warming sun sicilian wood quintessential tom daxon fragrance powerfully evocative fascinating evolution ultimately equal parts surprising satisfying opening vivid citrus instantly captivating blend lemon tangerine bergamot startlingly realistic feel little squirt juice peel skin tangerine hint sweetness like freshly squeezed orange juice move blend gentle lily valley jasmine strong resolute cedar sandalwood appear soul fragrance revealed rich confident wood twist citrus,"lemon, tangerine, bergamot, cardamom, gaiac wood, jasmine, lily valley, amber cedarwood, sandalwood"
Resin Sacra Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"A meditation on the beauty of the ambiguous nature of frankincense. An evocative shape-shifter, this tantalizing blend takes advantage of the diversity of its central ingredient to offer an experience both cool and church-like, and warm and sensual. A honeyed suede â sweet, soft and rich â cradles the frankincense as it emerges, creating an air of delicious opulence as resinous swirls of benzoin and cistus meld with the frankincense, leading it away from the gothic chill of stone and ceremony and celebrating its mesmerizing sensuality. And yet as the fragrance warms on the skin, the sweetness becomes less pronounced, and the transporting, ethereal side of frankincense emerges. We never cross fully to the sacred side, but those aspects of this compelling note keep the luxury in balance. Gorgeous and mystical.","suede, frankincense, patchouli, benzoin, cistus, ambroxan, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,meditation beauty ambiguous nature frankincense evocative shape shifter tantalizing blend takes advantage diversity central ingredient offer experience cool church like warm sensual honeyed suede sweet soft rich cradles frankincense emerges creating air delicious opulence resinous swirls benzoin cistus meld frankincense leading away gothic chill stone ceremony celebrating mesmerizing sensuality yet fragrance warms skin sweetness becomes less pronounced transporting ethereal side frankincense emerges never cross fully sacred side aspects compelling note keep luxury balance gorgeous mystical,"suede, frankincense, patchouli, benzoin, cistus, ambroxan, sandalwood, vetiver"
Iridium Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"We don't know what fragrance James Bond tends to wear, but we're certain he'd make room in his rotation for Iridium. After all, just like the legendary super-spy himself, this genuinely elegant scent has a subtle, dangerously complex secret identity. Iridium opens with a cool martini-like blast of juniper. A teaser of carrot seed and angelica introduces a silvery iris. Gliding in as sleekly as a pristine 1964 Aston Martin DB5, the natural root-like earthiness gives way to a bracing glint of metal. A base of understated cedar and the enigmatic but irresistible Iso E Super adds warmth and depth. Iridium may be soft spoken, but never underestimate the seductive power hiding just beneath the surface.","juniper, angelica, carrot seed, iris, vetiver, cedarwood, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,know fragrance james bond tends wear we're certain he'd make room rotation iridium like legendary super spy genuinely elegant scent subtle dangerously complex secret identity iridium opens cool martini like blast juniper teaser carrot seed angelica introduces silvery iris gliding sleekly pristine aston martin db natural root like earthiness gives way bracing glint metal base understated cedar enigmatic irresistible iso e super adds warmth depth iridium may soft spoken never underestimate seductive power hiding beneath surface,"juniper, angelica, carrot seed, iris, vetiver, cedarwood, iso e super"
Salvia Sclarea Eau de Parfum,Tom Daxon,"A sweeping wind of brilliant spring green. Salvia sclarea is the botanical name for clary sage, and this fragrance is built around an outstanding clary sage note - clear, sparkling, with a touch of sweetness - blended with crisp grass and cool violet leaves to further deepen the sensation of endless green fields. The effect is not an orderly, manicured lawn, but rather a wild meadow, sprinkled with wildflowers and wet with dew. It is intensely, joyously, vibrantly green. Jasmine adds a clean floral freshness and oak moss, cashmeran and musk add a layer of velvety softness underneath, acting as supporting players in this ode to an early summer morning. Gorgeous, fresh and calming.","grass, green violet leaf, bergamot, elemi, clary sage, jasmine, oakmoss, cashmeran, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sweeping wind brilliant spring green salvia sclarea botanical name clary sage fragrance built around outstanding clary sage note clear sparkling touch sweetness blended crisp grass cool violet leaves deepen sensation endless green fields effect orderly manicured lawn rather wild meadow sprinkled wildflowers wet dew intensely joyously vibrantly green jasmine adds clean floral freshness oak moss cashmeran musk add layer velvety softness underneath acting supporting players ode early summer morning gorgeous fresh calming,"grass, green violet leaf, bergamot, elemi, clary sage, jasmine, oakmoss, cashmeran, white musk"
Agua Magnoliana Eau de Parfum,Fueguia 1833,"A glorious abundance of magnolia. The scent of the magnolia is delicate and intoxicating â clean and brisk with a squeeze of citrus and a honeyed sweetness on top. This fragrance is a tribute to Magnolia Amazonica -- the guardian trees of the Amazonian rainforests. They grow over 60 feet high and their luminous white flowers open at night, disseminating their euphoric scent in a dreamy tropical haze. Imagine a hot and starry night when all of the thousands of fragile blossoms on the oversized tree unfurl their petals at the very same time, releasing an exuberant wave of transporting scent. Jasmine adds her flirtatious headiness to the mix and Indian sandalwood adds just enough warmth and weight to keep the whole thing from floating off into the ether like an escaped balloon. Agua Magnolia achieves that perfect balance of clean and sweet that we look for in a white floral. Ridiculously pretty.
Agua Magnolia is from the Linneo collection, named in honor of Carl Linnaeus, a poet who became a naturalist. Each fragrance in this collection highlights a native South American plant.","amazon magnolia, santalum album, grandiflorum jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,glorious abundance magnolia scent magnolia delicate intoxicating clean brisk squeeze citrus honeyed sweetness top fragrance tribute magnolia amazonica guardian trees amazonian rainforests grow feet high luminous white flowers open night disseminating euphoric scent dreamy tropical haze imagine hot starry night thousands fragile blossoms oversized tree unfurl petals time releasing exuberant wave transporting scent jasmine adds flirtatious headiness mix indian sandalwood adds enough warmth weight keep whole thing floating ether like escaped balloon agua magnolia achieves perfect balance clean sweet look white floral ridiculously pretty agua magnolia linneo collection named honor carl linnaeus poet became naturalist fragrance collection highlights native south american plant,"amazon magnolia, santalum album, grandiflorum jasmine"

Orgasmo Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"A swoon-inducing almond elixir that opens with a splash of Amaretto on the rocks. Amaretto is the beloved Italian almond-flavored liqueur whose name means ""a little bitter"", which it definitely is. However, it is also a little sweet, with a cherry-like fruitiness that counters the bitterness. That elusive bittersweet quality is at the heart of almond's appeal and is the centerpiece of this compelling scent. The almond note is full and complex, stepping forward after the intoxicating sweetness of the opening subsides. There is a creamy, dough-like quality underneath âÂ not sugary cookie dough, but rich and buttery bread dough laced with almonds and fruit, with a whisper of salt. There are many elements of a comfort scent here, but the insistent, tantalizing thrum of almond's dark side keeps this enticingly dangerous. An undercurrent of dry, cool wood gives this the dusky feel of rough velvet and distant smoke. According to Hilde, this was inspired by drinking iced almond coffee on the beach with good friends. All we can say is that must have been some really special coffee and some really nice friends, because this sensuous scent evokes a feeling of true euphoria. Orgasmo has that hypnotic effect where you always want to take one more sniff... just one more. A must have for almond lovers.","almond, amaretto liqueur accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,swoon inducing almond elixir opens splash amaretto rocks amaretto beloved italian almond flavored liqueur whose name means little bitter definitely however also little sweet cherry like fruitiness counters bitterness elusive bittersweet quality heart almond's appeal centerpiece compelling scent almond note full complex stepping forward intoxicating sweetness opening subsides creamy dough like quality underneath sugary cookie dough rich buttery bread dough laced almonds fruit whisper salt many elements comfort scent insistent tantalizing thrum almond's dark side keeps enticingly dangerous undercurrent dry cool wood gives dusky feel rough velvet distant smoke according hilde inspired drinking iced almond coffee beach good friends say must really special coffee really nice friends sensuous scent evokes feeling true euphoria orgasmo hypnotic effect always want take one sniff one must almond lovers,"almond, amaretto liqueur accord"

It's then that this beautiful brew unveils its soul as it revels in the push/pull of opposing force, letting each of the notes unfold before evolving to something new.

Cristina is named after one of Hilde's best friends, who loved the fragrance so much that she became the namesake. Appropriately, the theme of friendship and duality is prevalent in the fragrance. Cristina combines two types of rare patchouli as essential ingredients in the composition; each bringing out the best in the other. The patchouli notes in Cristina have a subtle feeling of Incense and Oud-like familiarity, as if they possess the wisdom of multiple lifetimes. Vanilla and cistus labdanum provide the comforting heart of the fragrance, acting as the glowing center upon which the duet of patchouli thrives. Cristina defies all expectation of a patchouli fragrance, and even those that thought they were not patchouli lovers will be proven wrong.","patchouli, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46625.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hilde soliani's cristina part gli invisibili collection aptly scent subtle comforting cloak earth amber like guardian angel cristina named one hilde's best friends loved fragrance much became namesake appropriately theme friendship duality prevalent fragrance cristina combines two types rare patchouli essential ingredients composition bringing best patchouli notes cristina subtle feeling incense oud like familiarity possess wisdom multiple lifetimes vanilla cistus labdanum provide comforting heart fragrance acting glowing center upon duet patchouli thrives cristina defies expectation patchouli fragrance even thought patchouli lovers proven wrong,"patchouli, labdanum, vanilla"
Poudre de Riz Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection,"Inspired by a line in the 1908 novel L'Enfer by Henri Barbusse ""...The air in the disordered shuttered room was heavy with a mixture of odours: Soap, face powder, the sharp tang of cologne...""
Poudre de Riz is a soft insinuating blend of rose petals, rice powder, monoi flowers and vanilla.

450 Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561,"If we could smell the woods, meadows and flower garlands depicted in Sandro Botticelli's Primavera, their spring beauty might very well resemble 450 by Farmacia SS Annunziata, named after the 450 Jubilee of the ancient Farmacia, which was established in the year of 1561 in the San Nicolo monastery.
450 gives the impression of being a rustic floral, the marriage of its notes joined together by the wind and sealed with kisses from the sun. With its brisk, aromatic citrus top notes, light rosy floral heart tempered by woods, and its ambery-musky base with a touch of incense, 450 is spring in all its rawness, freshness, and warmth. In the drydown, woodsy florals are softened by Florentine orris with its powdery, earthy gentleness and the ambery-vanillic sweetness of coumarin.
A perfect unisex fragrance for hot weather, 450 could easily adorn (and cool off) the wearer of a seersucker suit or a white linen dress. Fresh, transparent, warm and divine.","musk, iris, amber, aromatic notes, incense, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,could smell woods meadows flower garlands depicted sandro botticelli's primavera spring beauty might well resemble farmacia ss annunziata named jubilee ancient farmacia established year san nicolo monastery gives impression rustic floral marriage notes joined together wind sealed kisses sun brisk aromatic citrus top notes light rosy floral heart tempered woods ambery musky base touch incense spring rawness freshness warmth drydown woodsy florals softened florentine orris powdery earthy gentleness ambery vanillic sweetness coumarin perfect unisex fragrance hot weather could easily adorn cool wearer seersucker suit white linen dress fresh transparent warm divine,"musk, iris, amber, aromatic notes, incense, vanilla"
Emir Eau de parfum,M. Micallef,"M. Micallef's latest creation, Emir, flaunts the use of complex and raw natural materials, in a unique East meets West composition. The splendid heart of oud and leather is gently softened by cedar and patchouli, giving it a comforting and resinous appeal. Savory pepper notes give this scent a masculine edge, and notes of orange and grapefruit perk it up, bringing it out of the agarwood forest and into the light. As it develops on the skin, Emir reveals a softer side of geranium and white musk, rounding out its olfactory composition perfectly. The ideal blend of oud, smoke, sweet, and spice, Emir is the perfect distinctive masculine fragrance to wear anytime, for any occasion.","orange, grapefruit, geranium, oud, black pepper, patchouli, cedarwood, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/24529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,micallef's latest creation emir flaunts use complex raw natural materials unique east meets west composition splendid heart oud leather gently softened cedar patchouli giving comforting resinous appeal savory pepper notes give scent masculine edge notes orange grapefruit perk bringing agarwood forest light develops skin emir reveals softer side geranium white musk rounding olfactory composition perfectly ideal blend oud smoke sweet spice emir perfect distinctive masculine fragrance wear anytime occasion,"orange, grapefruit, geranium, oud, black pepper, patchouli, cedarwood, leather, musk"
Bombay Bling Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"""This joyful creation embodies every aspect of the very modern, colorful, eclectic, esoteric, ecstatic, liberal, happy side of buzzing India"", Neela Vermeire explains. And what a buzz Bombay Bling is, starting with the bang of a huge, raspy green mango before exploding into a vibrant, tropical blend of jasmine, tuberose, ylang-ylang, plumeria and gardenia.
This extravagantly lavish bouquet is rooted in wood and tobacco notes, which give it an intriguing hint of masculinity. Lads who feel they can rock white florals could give this a try.

Mohur Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"The name refers to the most valuable gold coin in India's history, the last of which was minted in 1918. A way, perhaps, of underlining the value given to perfumery during the Mogul era, an art so highly considered that the most powerful empress of the Mughal dynasty, Noor Jahan, devoted herself to perfecting it.
Though Mohur is built on the classic Eastern accord of rose and oud, with its powdery orris accords it also manages to conjure the opulence of classic French fragrances. It is also, despite the richness of its floral accords, a unisex scent, with leather effects alluding to high tea after a polo match in the British Raj, and perhaps a whiff of fine-milled English soap.
But the real surprise in Mohur is the subtle Indian pastry accord tucked in the petals of its rose garden, with notes of carrot, almond, cardamom and ambrette, lending a tender touch to this majestic composition. If Patou had been Indian, this would have been Joy...","cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot, black pepper, elemi, rose oil, jasmine, orris, hawthorn, almond milk accord, leather, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, oud palao, benzoin, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name refers valuable gold coin india's history last minted way perhaps underlining value given perfumery mogul era art highly considered powerful empress mughal dynasty noor jahan devoted perfecting though mohur built classic eastern accord rose oud powdery orris accords also manages conjure opulence classic french fragrances also despite richness floral accords unisex scent leather effects alluding high tea polo match british raj perhaps whiff fine milled english soap real surprise mohur subtle indian pastry accord tucked petals rose garden notes carrot almond cardamom ambrette lending tender touch majestic composition patou indian would joy,"cardamom, coriander, ambrette, carrot, black pepper, elemi, rose oil, jasmine, orris, hawthorn, almond milk accord, leather, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, oud palao, benzoin, vanilla, tonka bean"
Trayee Eau de Parfum,Neela Vermeire Creations,"The name means ""triad"", an allusion to the sacred origin of the first three Vedas, the most ancient sacred texts in India. The notes are drawn from the ingredients used in religious rituals and ayurvedic medicine during the Vedic era. Rich in incense, myrrh and oud, the fragrance is a poignant blend of smoke, spices and resins that harks back to the very origins of perfumery â a burnt offering to the gods and an aid to meditation.
Bertrand Duchaufour has always excelled at bringing transparency to dark resinous notes, and he surpasses himself in the smoky blend: Trayee is amazingly facetted, with green (basil, cardamom, cassis), floral (jasmine), spicy (ginger, cinnamon, clove), leather (saffron, oud), smoky (vetiver, sandalwood) and balsamic (myrrh, vanilla) effects, dominated by the quintessentially Indian fragrances of sandalwood and jasmine. The perfumer has even added an arrestingly realistic ganja accord, a memory of the sadus he ran across during his trips in India.
Trayee's smoky tendrils may not have consciousness-altering effects, but we suspect that the gorgeous natural materials in the formula might be aromatherapeutic. Beauty heals.","blue ginger, elemi, cinnamon, ganja accord, blackcurrant absolute, basil, jasmine sambac, jasmine, cardamom absolute, clove, saffron, vetiver, incense, sandalwood oil, patchouli, myrrh, vanilla, cedar, amber notes, oud palao, oak moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name means triad allusion sacred origin first three vedas ancient sacred texts india notes drawn ingredients used religious rituals ayurvedic medicine vedic era rich incense myrrh oud fragrance poignant blend smoke spices resins harks back origins perfumery burnt offering gods aid meditation bertrand duchaufour always excelled bringing transparency dark resinous notes surpasses smoky blend trayee amazingly facetted green basil cardamom cassis floral jasmine spicy ginger cinnamon clove leather saffron oud smoky vetiver sandalwood balsamic myrrh vanilla effects dominated quintessentially indian fragrances sandalwood jasmine perfumer even added arrestingly realistic ganja accord memory sadus ran across trips india trayee's smoky tendrils may consciousness altering effects suspect gorgeous natural materials formula might aromatherapeutic beauty heals,"blue ginger, elemi, cinnamon, ganja accord, blackcurrant absolute, basil, jasmine sambac, jasmine, cardamom absolute, clove, saffron, vetiver, incense, sandalwood oil, patchouli, myrrh, vanilla, cedar, amber notes, oud palao, oak moss"
Myrrhiad Eau de Parfum,Pierre Guillaume Paris Black Collection,"The amazingly prolific Pierre Guillaume adds a ninth scent to HuitiÃ¨me Art, a line dedicated to rare natural organic ingredients and original accords based on novel âplant capturesâ. But this time, instead of pear tree bark or organic Moroccan verbena, he tackles one of the most ancient and sacred aromatic ingredients known to mankind: myrrh.
Myrrh resin is an olfactory world in itself, with bitter, ambery and balsamic facets. Guillaume, who has always had a bent for gourmand notes, amplifies those facets by matching them with a cocktail of vanillas to boost the balsamic effects. The cool burn of licorice draws the blend towards mouth-watering darkness shot with green glints of anise and milky almond plushness.
But the real surprise springs from the splash of black tea absolute that soaks the bittersweet potion with smoky, tarry, almost animalic effects, and turn into a gloriously dark, smooth leather scent.
Myrrhiad conjures the sacred and erotic origins of perfume. Whether you wear it to connect with your inner Wise Man or priestess, or for a seduction ritual, is entirely up to you.","myrrh, black tea absolute, vanilla, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/54510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,amazingly prolific pierre guillaume adds ninth scent huiti art line dedicated rare natural organic ingredients original accords based novel plant captures time instead pear tree bark organic moroccan verbena tackles one ancient sacred aromatic ingredients known mankind myrrh myrrh resin olfactory world bitter ambery balsamic facets guillaume always bent gourmand notes amplifies facets matching cocktail vanillas boost balsamic effects cool burn licorice draws blend towards mouth watering darkness shot green glints anise milky almond plushness real surprise springs splash black tea absolute soaks bittersweet potion smoky tarry almost animalic effects turn gloriously dark smooth leather scent myrrhiad conjures sacred erotic origins perfume whether wear connect inner wise man priestess seduction ritual entirely,"myrrh, black tea absolute, vanilla, licorice"
Oro Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo,"The power of gold (oro) has tugged at the human soul for millennia, bringing with it intense emotions and indescribable beauty and artistry. Translating gold's majesty and possibilities from the senses of touch and sight to smell was a Herculean task, and one Omnia Profumo spared no expense in doing. Oro is a shaded glen dappled with golden light, scented with light touches of fresh lemon and bergamot that meld with a breeze carrying a zingy, wild cyclamen. The breeze picks up with a gust of peony, lavender and spring lilac, and bids farewell as a rich and sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds. The vanilla-like coumarin and exquisite sandalwood are perfect accompaniments-- you didn't think a perfume called Oro would be a coquettish giggle of a perfume, right? Don't assume it's overly heavy or ostentatious; Oro is feminine and sexy without trying too hard, that just-right combo of sweet and dark that will have people running the wrong way down an escalator to ask you what you're wearing.","lemon, bergamot, cyclamen, lavender, lilac, peony, patchouli, sandalwood, coumarin, incense, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,power gold oro tugged human soul millennia bringing intense emotions indescribable beauty artistry translating gold's majesty possibilities senses touch sight smell herculean task one omnia profumo spared expense oro shaded glen dappled golden light scented light touches fresh lemon bergamot meld breeze carrying zingy wild cyclamen breeze picks gust peony lavender spring lilac bids farewell rich sensual vanilla/patchouli combination unfolds vanilla like coumarin exquisite sandalwood perfect accompaniments think perfume called oro would coquettish giggle perfume right assume overly heavy ostentatious oro feminine sexy without trying hard right combo sweet dark people running wrong way escalator ask wearing,"lemon, bergamot, cyclamen, lavender, lilac, peony, patchouli, sandalwood, coumarin, incense, vanilla"
Conaffetto Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"A delightful, romantic filigree of almonds, sugar and soaringly lovely orange blossom. Created for a dear friend's wedding, Soliani was inspired by ""confetti"" the sugar coated almond candies served at weddings in Italy and around the world. You may know them better as Jordan almonds. This is not an easy, melt-in-your-mouth sort of candy. The sugarcoating is to convey the wish that the newlyweds' life be more sweet than bitter and the beauty of these candies is that the almonds really do have a sharp bitterness that contrasts with the powdery sweetness. That beguiling contradiction is captured perfectly in this scent and leads into an absolutely gorgeous profusion of fresh orange blossoms, as if you were walking under a wedding bower. Conafetto features an absolutely radiant version of fleur d'oranger â a touch of honey, a touch of citrus and a bounty of ethereal white flowers. We can't imagine a more perfect scent for a wedding â but you don't need to be a bride to love this. Any time you want to dab on a dose of sheer joy, this would be appropriate.","orange blossom, almond, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46614.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,delightful romantic filigree almonds sugar soaringly lovely orange blossom created dear friend's wedding soliani inspired confetti sugar coated almond candies served weddings italy around world may know better jordan almonds easy melt mouth sort candy sugarcoating convey wish newlyweds' life sweet bitter beauty candies almonds really sharp bitterness contrasts powdery sweetness beguiling contradiction captured perfectly scent leads absolutely gorgeous profusion fresh orange blossoms walking wedding bower conafetto features absolutely radiant version fleur d'oranger touch honey touch citrus bounty ethereal white flowers can't imagine perfect scent wedding need bride love time want dab dose sheer joy would appropriate,"orange blossom, almond, sugar"
Patchouli Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942,"Let's face it: Patchouli can be maddening to describe because it smells like nothing else in the world but patchouli. Yes, it's earthy and rich, but those adjectives fail to conjure up the hypnotic, evocative qualities that make patchouli so distinctive. Luckily, if we simply state the obvious â Patchouli Nobile is a patchouli scent â we have a good place to begin because we all know that deep, highly recognizable note. The question is, is it a good patchouli scent? Happily, the answer is yes. In fact, it's not just a good patchouli scent, it's a great one: It seduces without resorting to brute force, it has a caressing amber-tinged sweetness that nestles into the loamy richness of clean earth and smooth wood and it retains the dry freshness of its opening of incense and pepper. It is both elegantly refined and devastatingly sexy. The patchouli is absolutely present, but it's not overpowering, and the layers of sandalwood, oak moss, amber and tonka add a luxurious, velvety quality that makes this superbly wearable. It goes without saying that if you are already a fan of patchouli, you need to try this, but we feel that this cozy and alluring scent has the potential to win new converts to the patchouli cult, as well. Outstanding.","citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,let's face patchouli maddening describe smells like nothing else world patchouli yes earthy rich adjectives fail conjure hypnotic evocative qualities make patchouli distinctive luckily simply state obvious patchouli nobile patchouli scent good place begin know deep highly recognizable note question good patchouli scent happily answer yes fact good patchouli scent great one seduces without resorting brute force caressing amber tinged sweetness nestles loamy richness clean earth smooth wood retains dry freshness opening incense pepper elegantly refined devastatingly sexy patchouli absolutely present overpowering layers sandalwood oak moss amber tonka add luxurious velvety quality makes superbly wearable goes without saying already fan patchouli need try feel cozy alluring scent potential win new converts patchouli cult well outstanding,"citrus, white pepper, frankincense, patchouli, gaic wood, cistus, jasmine cedarwood, amber, oak moss, sandalwood, tonka"
Estroverso Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942,"sparkling burst of lemon, orange and tangerine gives this lively scent an opening as dazzling as the sun bursting through clouds. Estroverso is a combination of estro â the Italian word of inspiration and intuition â and verso (against) -- and it is meant to convey that drive to follow inspiration against all odds. It is the passion of invention and creation, and that stubborn streak that compels you to pursue your dreams even when things look hopeless.
The vivid citrus and herbs dance over a complex mÃ©lange of vetiver, ambergris, cedar and musk. This has the classic eau de cologne structure, but heightened. The citrus is extra bright and the base is rich and complex. And there is a little bit of something edgy in there; we are assuming it's the mugwort, because it is what we would imagine a plant with startling healing properties and possible magical applications would smell like â green and potent. Overall, a scintillating potion that will keep you upbeat and alert while waiting for inspiration to strike.","lemon, orange, tangerine, lime, rosemary, mugwort, cedarwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sparkling burst lemon orange tangerine gives lively scent opening dazzling sun bursting clouds estroverso combination estro italian word inspiration intuition verso meant convey drive follow inspiration odds passion invention creation stubborn streak compels pursue dreams even things look hopeless vivid citrus herbs dance complex lange vetiver ambergris cedar musk classic eau de cologne structure heightened citrus extra bright base rich complex little bit something edgy assuming mugwort would imagine plant startling healing properties possible magical applications would smell like green potent overall scintillating potion keep upbeat alert waiting inspiration strike,"lemon, orange, tangerine, lime, rosemary, mugwort, cedarwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, ambergris"
Ambra Nobile Eau de Parfum,Nobile 1942,"A classic amber scent, impeccably done. Warm, powdery and soothing. A fresh citrus and orange blossom opening leads us to the heart of ambergris, labdanum and patchouli. There is a startling hint of salt and stone in the transition and, though we quickly move past that into a smooth and comforting blend of tonka bean, vetiver, cedar and sandalwood, there is something intriguingly solid and cool beneath all the warm elements. This is a fragrance with presence: It has a soft, satisfying sweetness, but it's not candied or syrupy. It's calming, but it feels much too sophisticated to describe it as cozy. The word that leaps to mind is regal. It feels as if this was created for the exclusive use of nobility and we managed to sneak a bottle out of the palace for ourselves. Don't we all deserve to be treated like royalty sometimes? Pure elegance.","neroli, bergamot, ambergris, labdanum, patchouli, tonka bean, sandalwood, cedarwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,classic amber scent impeccably done warm powdery soothing fresh citrus orange blossom opening leads us heart ambergris labdanum patchouli startling hint salt stone transition though quickly move past smooth comforting blend tonka bean vetiver cedar sandalwood something intriguingly solid cool beneath warm elements fragrance presence soft satisfying sweetness candied syrupy calming feels much sophisticated describe cozy word leaps mind regal feels created exclusive use nobility managed sneak bottle palace deserve treated like royalty sometimes pure elegance,"neroli, bergamot, ambergris, labdanum, patchouli, tonka bean, sandalwood, cedarwood, vetiver"

Il Vs Iris Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"Il Vs Iris, Hilde Soliani's ode to the precious flower, might be the most charming take on iris. The most surprising too, because the soft, child-like initial impression of the scent fools the wearer into believing that it is a simple, uncomplicated blend. .But wait for the fresh, gently rooty floral top notes to subside, and you will be startled by the beautiful dry greenness of the next accord, woody and verdant, a peppery smell of young leaves and twigs. Wait a little longer, and you will see why we believe that this enchanting composition would delight not only lovers of iris, but also fans of almond and heliotrope. The honeyed nuttiness of almond is not too sweet, just enough to make the perfume downy and soft, fluffy, innocent and unexpectedly sensual.

Acquiiissssima Eau de Parfum,Hilde Soliani,"With Acquiilssssima, Hilde Soliani translates haute cuisine into haute parfumerie. Inspired by a dish created by an Italian chef, the scent blends the salty, mineral, fresh aroma of the sea with green tea and jasmine. Those wary of aquatic scents need not be afraid. The saline, subtly, strangely animalic, seaweedy-green smell of the sea is unmistakable here, but it does not lend the composition that aggressively fresh quality so typical of marine fragrances. The pairing of this verdant saltiness and sweet jasmine petals is unexpected, striking and truly sublime. The watery and the floral aspects of the blend are tied together with a green tea note, which possesses qualities of the both, and which lends Acquiilssssima delicate its translucency and a calm, airy feel.

Yvon Mouchel created the 7th addition to the world of Divine around this theme. Linked to its masculine counterpart by the same name, l'Ãªtre aimÃ© femme (âthe beloved womanâ) also shares with it the note that lies in its heart: the everlasting flower with its warm, intense, sunny aroma. The feminine l'Ãªtre aimÃ© enhances the sun-filled quality of helichrysium with the bright, juicy citrus top notes. The dazzling accord of neroli, bergamot and nectarine gracefully leads to the equally radiant bouquet of the middle notes, in which everlasting flowers are mixed with jasmine, lily and rose. The base notes of amber, sandalwood vetiver and vanilla are trademark Divine, lush and elegant, the classic French perfumery at its best.","neroli, bergamot, nectarine, jasmine, lily, tincture rose, everlasting flowers, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,heart lives perfume never forget fragrance one love yvon mouchel created th addition world divine around theme linked masculine counterpart name l' tre aim femme beloved woman also shares note lies heart everlasting flower warm intense sunny aroma feminine l' tre aim enhances sun filled quality helichrysium bright juicy citrus top notes dazzling accord neroli bergamot nectarine gracefully leads equally radiant bouquet middle notes everlasting flowers mixed jasmine lily rose base notes amber sandalwood vetiver vanilla trademark divine lush elegant classic french perfumery best,"neroli, bergamot, nectarine, jasmine, lily, tincture rose, everlasting flowers, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver vanilla"
Ambra Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo,"An elegant and dry amber with a sparkling citrus opening. Despite the presence of heavy-hitter base notes like opoponax and patchouli, Ambra feels sheer and refined. The sweetness of the amber and vanilla is balanced with the sharp pepperiness of lavender and a cool, meditative blend of incense notes. This is an amber that is spare, rather than opulent, with a brisk spiciness that complements the sensuous warmth and makes this versatile and easy to wear. If you have been looking for an amber that is wearable day or night and that works in warm weather as well as cool, this is the one. It still has that golden, hypnotic quality that makes amber so addictive, but it is dry and subtle enough to work as an everyday fragrance.","orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,elegant dry amber sparkling citrus opening despite presence heavy hitter base notes like opoponax patchouli ambra feels sheer refined sweetness amber vanilla balanced sharp pepperiness lavender cool meditative blend incense notes amber spare rather opulent brisk spiciness complements sensuous warmth makes versatile easy wear looking amber wearable day night works warm weather well cool one still golden hypnotic quality makes amber addictive dry subtle enough work everyday fragrance,"orange, bergamot, geranium, incense, lavender, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum, opoponax, amber"
Madera Eau de Parfum,Omnia Profumo,"Delicious, dreamy caramel. If you are a fan of foodie scents, this is for you. It is a giant vat of golden, buttery caramel goodness ready for you to dip yourself in like a carnival apple. Rich vanilla and creamy coconut give this a hint of Mounds bar yumminess (without the chocolate), and a whipped cream smoothness comes from the soft musk and gentle flowers. But mostly, there is caramel â absolutely decadent and sticky-toffee sweet, comforting and enveloping and warm. This is the gooey center of a delicious candy â molten sugar and cream cooked oh-so-slowly until it magically transforms. We've rarely encountered a scent that captured the lusciousness of caramel so well . As you know, many of the sugar-laced scents and lotions in the mass market veer into the bitter, plasticky realm as they wear on the skin but this one miraculously does not. Madera has achieved caramel perfection and stays creamy and delectable all the way through. Truly scrumptious.","vanilla pod, caramel, vanilla, peach blossom, wildflowers, tobacco flower, coconut, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,delicious dreamy caramel fan foodie scents giant vat golden buttery caramel goodness ready dip like carnival apple rich vanilla creamy coconut give hint mounds bar yumminess without chocolate whipped cream smoothness comes soft musk gentle flowers mostly caramel absolutely decadent sticky toffee sweet comforting enveloping warm gooey center delicious candy molten sugar cream cooked oh slowly magically transforms we've rarely encountered scent captured lusciousness caramel well know many sugar laced scents lotions mass market veer bitter plasticky realm wear skin one miraculously madera achieved caramel perfection stays creamy delectable way truly scrumptious,"vanilla pod, caramel, vanilla, peach blossom, wildflowers, tobacco flower, coconut, white musk"
Onice Eau de Parfum ...,Omnia Profumo,"Not every fragrance can be described in a line or two â some take a winding path to get to their destination. Onice is one of those fragrances. It opens with a fresh, green, vegetal note. We smell celery, which isn't listed in the notes. Then we get the beginnings of a dense and complicated sweetness that reminds us of immortelle, which is also not listed in the notes. Just when we are about to ignore the notes altogether we get a definite dollop of licorice and a delightfully sweet pineapple â both listed and both very present as they waltz with a variety of partners. Delicate hyacinth, sharp mint, earthy cedar, a dusting of nutmeg. It's an enchanting and unusual journey, that appears to lead to different places for different people â on some Onice is sweet and fruity, on others the green and wood notes dominate. The consensus is that it is light and fresh without being aquatic or soapy or citrus and that it is very hard to pin down exactly what it smells like, although we all agree that it smells quite good. Intriguing.","citrus, anise, lavender, licorice, peach, pineapple, rose, nutmeg, geranium, hyacinth, jasmine, ylang-ylang, mint, sandalwood, musk, cedarwood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,every fragrance described line two take winding path get destination onice one fragrances opens fresh green vegetal note smell celery listed notes get beginnings dense complicated sweetness reminds us immortelle also listed notes ignore notes altogether get definite dollop licorice delightfully sweet pineapple listed present waltz variety partners delicate hyacinth sharp mint earthy cedar dusting nutmeg enchanting unusual journey appears lead different places different people onice sweet fruity others green wood notes dominate consensus light fresh without aquatic soapy citrus hard pin exactly smells like although agree smells quite good intriguing,"citrus, anise, lavender, licorice, peach, pineapple, rose, nutmeg, geranium, hyacinth, jasmine, ylang-ylang, mint, sandalwood, musk, cedarwood, amber"
Vaniglia del Madagascar Parfum Concentration,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561,"A classic, full-bodied vanilla â rich, creamy and sweet â that is a prime example of why vanilla scents are so very beloved. A hint of citrus leads to a delectable fruitiness and then it is full-on vanilla in all its luscious, craving-inducing glory. There are a lot of vanilla scented things in the world, but as any passionate vanilla fan will tell you, they are not all created equal. Quality matters, and a finely crafted vanilla scent is as different from the plasticky, mass-marketed versions as leather is from vinyl. It is no surprise that Farmacia SS Annunziata has given us a superlative version that is tantalizingly edible and utterly seductive. Floral grace notes and velvety amber add warmth and complexity, but they are in the mix as supporting players â dreamy, delicious vanilla is the star attraction here, and she deserves her spotlight.

Reve en Cuir Eau de Parfum,Indult,"Reve en Cuir was created by Francis Kurkdjian, the perfumer whose talent and work we admire, as an Indult for Scent Bar fragrance. Knowing our love for leather, you will not be surprised to learn that this Luckyscent exclusive is built on the rich leather accord. The traditional citrusy top notes are given a modern twist by the inclusion of spices, cardamom and cloves, and oregano. Instead of being typically fresh, bergamot and lemon in Reve en Cuir have a delicately candied quality and set the tone of the composition with a rich, indolent feel. Cedar and patchouli enhance the smoky character of the leather while never allowing it to become tarry. Oakmoss and vetiver lend the scent that elegantly earthy character that we adore in classical masculine perfumes, while vanilla compliments the citrusy-spicy side of the blend, softening the sharp angles and making Reve en Cuir indeed dreamy and sensual. Spicy, smoky leather with a dangerously appealing soft side â we fall for that every time. Reve en Cuir was conceived as a masculine creation, but as every woman who has ever borrowed her boyfriend's leather jacket knows â some rules are made to be broken.","bergamot, lemon, cardamom, oregano, clove bud, cedarwood, patchouli, oak moss, vetiver, crystallized vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,reve en cuir created francis kurkdjian perfumer whose talent work admire indult scent bar fragrance knowing love leather surprised learn luckyscent exclusive built rich leather accord traditional citrusy top notes given modern twist inclusion spices cardamom cloves oregano instead typically fresh bergamot lemon reve en cuir delicately candied quality set tone composition rich indolent feel cedar patchouli enhance smoky character leather never allowing become tarry oakmoss vetiver lend scent elegantly earthy character adore classical masculine perfumes vanilla compliments citrusy spicy side blend softening sharp angles making reve en cuir indeed dreamy sensual spicy smoky leather dangerously appealing soft side fall every time reve en cuir conceived masculine creation every woman ever borrowed boyfriend's leather jacket knows rules made broken,"bergamot, lemon, cardamom, oregano, clove bud, cedarwood, patchouli, oak moss, vetiver, crystallized vanilla"
Patchouly Indonesiano Parfum ...,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561,"When we got the breakdown of notes for this line, we couldn't help but giggle when we first saw the listing for this fragrance. Head note: Indonesian patchouli, Heart note: Indonesian patchouli, Base note: Indonesian patchouli. But we stopped giggling and started swooning when we sniffed the actual fragrance, because yes â there is that much patchouli in it, and wow--it is absolutely gorgeous. The opening is dry, almost medicinal, then a grand and exotic symphony of dark, chewy sweetness and fresh-tilled earth appear and it is pure, mesmerizing, exotic, no-holds barred, patchouli splendor from that point on. This feels forbidden and irresistible, like an antique trunk full of contraband â but it also has the lush, damp greeness of the forest floor. All of the complexities and contradictions of this enigmatic note - the golden opulence, the herbaceous sharpness â are gloriously present. If you hate patchouli, this will not be your cup of tea.

Flirtatious and delicious, Chia wears its giddy, candied heart on its sleeve and revels proudly in its unabashed sweetness. The opening spins candy floss, orange and a soft, powdery rose into a shimmering gossamer strand that wraps around the sweet almond note that takes center stage.

Cara Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561,"Like taking a bite out of a meringue â the initial sugar crystal sweetness that melts into soft vanilla on your tongue, the powdery sensation of chewing the puffy white cloud of a cookie, the striking combination of richness and delicacy. Cara takes some of our favorite gourmand notes â sweet almond, golden caramel and milky vanilla â and makes them soft and airy by folding in dusky amber and talcum. The marshmallow sweet opening mellows into a dreamy vanilla-tinged veil of powder that melts into the skin, soothing and delicious. This is as comforting as a favorite cashmere throw, yet sophisticated enough to qualify as utterly grown up.

Takis Eau de Parfum,Farmacia SS. Annunziata dal 1561,"Streamlined and modern. Dazzlingly sharp lemon and peppery sage set the stage with a brisk, take-no-prisoners policy, and a clean musk and straightforward rose sweep through with equal efficiency. But when a majestic blend of velvety vanilla, exotic ylang ylang and mellow aged oak rolls in, everything slows down and brisk, angular edges are transformed into the smooth, burnished lines of a contemporary sculpture. Rounded and warm, with a sweet soapiness that is at once familiar and brand new -- like a new, improved soapiness that is a little bit spicier, a little bit creamier, a little bit more of everything we like about soap. Takis can range from a heightened skin scent to seductive night-on-the town scent once it settles in, depending on the chemistry of the wearer.

Vanille Oud Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef,"As far as we are concerned, there can't be too many great vanilla scents and there certainly can't be too many aouds. Combine the two, and we are smitten. We are addicted to this unique combo of creamy, dreamy vanilla and spicy, resinous aoud. It is a perfect yin and yang harmony. The caramel-like sweetness of vanilla mixed with ylang-ylang and prune softens the starkness of aoud. Oud, in turn, prevents the vanilla accord from being too predictably foodie and infantile.

Homme (Aoud) Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef,"Micallef's spicy, honeyed rendition of precious aoud, with its mix of golden saffron and dark-red roses, is sensual and wonderfully exotic. The dry smokiness of the fragrance makes us think of the ritual in Arabia, in which women stand over an oud burner, perfuming their skin and clothes with the unique, enthralling fragrance. Balmily sweet and spicily bitter, Micallef's Aoud is a complex, endlessly intriguing scent. It is said that sandalwood is the fragrance for novices, while aoud is for those in the know.

Avant Garde Eau de Parfum,M. Micallef,"The new masculine offering from Martine Micallef delivers the great promise of its name. The complex composition, built on the contrast of fresh and smoky, dry and almost gourmand, is as unconventional and modern as the name suggests. We love how perfectly the sweet smokiness of tobacco mixed with cocoa balances the striking freshness of the citrusy top notes. The incense and leather blend in the heart of the fragrance is incredibly alluring, a brooding, dark and handsome accord that we find irresistible.

Isvaraya Eau de Parfum,Indult,"In India, patchouli is associated with Vishnu, the god savior of mankind and life and the guardian of universal harmony. Isvaraya means divine in Hindi and this perfume is the olfactory fantasy of both modern India and spiritual India, an exotic elixir that blends light patchouli with smooth Indian plum tree and wraps it in jasmine. Although it centers on patchouli, it's not overly earthy. It's rich and unusual, slightly sweet and a tad smoky, a fevered evening spent on multi-hued silken sheets while wisps of incense burn sensually in the corners of your mind. The beautiful starkness of jasmine lights the darkness of patchouli and the deep, spiced fruitiness of the plum tree... utterly unique and completely exotic, Isvaraya is not a fluffy little fragrance you wear without thinking.

All That Matters Eau de Parfum,Anamor,"A subtle and elegant skin scent. Deceptively simple in composition, All That Matters is one of those fragrances that merges with your skin and reads more like an aura than a perfume. This simplicity works because of the quality of the ingredients. Any musk lover can tell you that not all musk is created equal. The musk at the heart of All That Matters is smooth, with a silken lightness that is almost airy. This particular musk is also very rare and prohibitively expensive âÂ therefore it is infrequently used in commercial fragrances except in tiny amounts. In this handcrafted blend, however, it is the star player -- paired with gorgeous and compelling sandalwood oil from East India and the delicate crispness of lily of the valley. Quiet and compelling.

Divine Eau de Parfum,Divine,"When we heard there was a cult fragrance named Divine, we had our doubts. It might be very nice, maybe even lovely, but seriously... divine? That's a bit presumptuous, isn't it? Then we tried it and all skepticism vanished. Divine is indeed divine. We can't think of a better way to describe it. The first whiff is very strong, very French, very opera and pearls. Classic and rather formal. As it warms up, it becomes downright swanky-- still sophisticated, but drenched in the glamour of a bygone era: Black Givenchy dresses, long cigarette holders and serious diamonds. Sipping ice-cold martinis with Frank and Dino on a red leather banquette at the Sands. And just then, best of all, there is the amazing and complex drydown, balancing soft peach and superbly fresh flowers with a deep base of oak moss, vanilla, musk and spice. Achingly beautiful, impossible to forget. Not a scent for those who prefer their scents girlish and sugary or simple and unobtrusive.

Escentric 05 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"""With Escentric 05 I wanted to create a different kind of summer fragrance. Instead of the usual aqueous notes, I was inspired by walking up from the sea on a hot afternoon through dry, aromatic Mediterranean herbs and trees."" -Geza Schoen
Cashmeran, the molecule at the heart of the 05 series, is dry, radiant, warm and woody with an unexpected touch of pine resin. It's this vibrant quality that caused Geza Schoen to flash back to the Mediterranean, where he spent his childhood summers, and as a result Escentric 05 is truly a different kind of summer scent, infused with vivid, glowing warmth and the contrast of sun-baked plants and trees. Escentric 05 opens with a wonderfully simply top of light, fresh bergamot, and a bright and happy orange note, chosen to represent the orange groves of our hypothetical island destination. Laurel and rosemary carry a signature freshness and spiciness, while a the herbal character of juniper plays against the dry, pungent woodiness of cypress. The drydown features two classic Mediterranean ingredients- cistus labdanum, with its sweet, leathery, balsamic richness, and mastic, a tree-based resin with the clean, sharp scent of newly-cut branches. And they're both layered over the signature 05 Series ingredient, cashmeran- an intoxicating 15% concentration within the formula that provides sensual, woodsy warmth. Far from a typically ""freshie"" summer scent, Escentric 05 captures the emotional warmth of summer memories in a scent with all the signature stylishness of Escentric Molecules.","fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30859.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,escentric wanted create different kind summer fragrance instead usual aqueous notes inspired walking sea hot afternoon dry aromatic mediterranean herbs trees geza schoen cashmeran molecule heart series dry radiant warm woody unexpected touch pine resin vibrant quality caused geza schoen flash back mediterranean spent childhood summers result escentric truly different kind summer scent infused vivid glowing warmth contrast sun baked plants trees escentric opens wonderfully simply top light fresh bergamot bright happy orange note chosen represent orange groves hypothetical island destination laurel rosemary carry signature freshness spiciness herbal character juniper plays dry pungent woodiness cypress drydown features two classic mediterranean ingredients cistus labdanum sweet leathery balsamic richness mastic tree based resin clean sharp scent newly cut branches they're layered signature series ingredient cashmeran intoxicating concentration within formula provides sensual woodsy warmth far typically freshie summer scent escentric captures emotional warmth summer memories scent signature stylishness escentric molecules,"fig, bergamot, orange, laurel, rosemary, juniper, basil, hedione, cypress, freesia, iris, jasmine, cashmeran, cistus labdanum, musc, ambroxan, mastic, iso e super"

Arborist possesses an overwhelming and spirited opening mellowing into sun-bleached woods, malted cereals and worked-skin. A symphony of nature untamed. The core structure of Arborist is redolent of many great Scots timbers; their leaves, flowers, fruits, roots and soil being the quintessential portrait of the forest.

Eau Capitale Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"When a brand as synonymous with niche fragrance as Diptyque decides to create a scent celebrating the city of Paris, the possibilities are almost overwhelming. What kind of scent could possibly capture the entirety of the rich, multi-textured relationship between The City of Lights and the house of Diptyque? But of course, there actually is a perfect answer- the chypre, iconic amongst perfume styles, a legendary accord with a thousand facets. But with the classic chypre so instantly identifiable- bergamot, rose, jasmine, patchouli, oakmoss- it's incumbent on any re-interpretation to bring something new and unique to the proceedings. Thus, Eau Capitale is a chypre both respectful of tradition, and yet uniquely and romantically modern- a dynamic new study of balance and contrast featuring a fresh yet timeless take on the beloved style. It still boats a lively citrus opening, but with a twist- an especially green ""vert de bergamote"" of pronounced energy, paired with a burst of pink peppercorn, unique to the chypre style, which gives a cool, sparkling opening of notable modernity. The heart has a classic rose presence, but utilizing three distinctive expressions of Damascene rose: an essence, an absolute, and a concentrate, for a truly multifaceted and complex floral experience. And finally, in place of the traditional oakmoss base, a patchouli ""coeur, "" a fractional extract with a brighter character than traditional patchouli, which closes us on an invigorating and modern high. Bright, fresh, romantic, and nuanced, Eau Capitale is a dynamic new chypre that proves that there's still ample life left in the classics- a fitting tribute to Paris if ever there was one.","bergamot, pink pepper, rose essence, rose absolute, rose concentrate, patchouli coeur",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,brand synonymous niche fragrance diptyque decides create scent celebrating city paris possibilities almost overwhelming kind scent could possibly capture entirety rich multi textured relationship city lights house diptyque course actually perfect answer chypre iconic amongst perfume styles legendary accord thousand facets classic chypre instantly identifiable bergamot rose jasmine patchouli oakmoss incumbent interpretation bring something new unique proceedings thus eau capitale chypre respectful tradition yet uniquely romantically modern dynamic new study balance contrast featuring fresh yet timeless take beloved style still boats lively citrus opening twist especially green vert de bergamote pronounced energy paired burst pink peppercorn unique chypre style gives cool sparkling opening notable modernity heart classic rose presence utilizing three distinctive expressions damascene rose essence absolute concentrate truly multifaceted complex floral experience finally place traditional oakmoss base patchouli coeur fractional extract brighter character traditional patchouli closes us invigorating modern high bright fresh romantic nuanced eau capitale dynamic new chypre proves there's still ample life left classics fitting tribute paris ever one,"bergamot, pink pepper, rose essence, rose absolute, rose concentrate, patchouli coeur"
Fougere L'Aube Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Boy, Manuel Cross wasnât messing around when he made FougÃ¨re LâAube. Modelled after the first fougÃ¨re ever to be made, the original FougÃ¨re Royale by Houbigant, FougÃ¨re LâAube heralds a triumphant return to the unapologetically masculine roots of the fougÃ¨re concept â the fresh, bitter aroma created by the marriage of lavender, oakmoss, and labdanum, given aromatic interest by way of minty geranium leaf and the sting of camphor.
FougÃ¨re LâAube is much more than a simple re-tread using great raw materials and real oakmoss, however. True to its name â which means âfougÃ¨re of the dawnâ â this scent opens with a burst of sparkling lemon and lavender, for a sunny âgarrigueâ effect thatâs much brighter than the traditional fougÃ¨re opening led by bergamot. The bitter green galbanum and dry hay soon move in to darken the foresty shadows, though, and with the cool rosy-minty sting of geranium in the background, the oft-cited reference to the scent of ferns (fougÃ¨re meaning âfernâ in French) for once makes perfect sense. This is really old school, masculine canon â strictly for lovers of classic fougÃ¨res like Azzaro Pour Homme, Brut, and crisp green scents such as Green Irish Tweed.","lavender, oakmoss, geranium, citrus, hay, galbanum, costus, musk, sandalwood, camphor, amber, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,boy manuel cross messing around made foug l aube modelled first foug ever made original foug royale houbigant foug l aube heralds triumphant return unapologetically masculine roots foug concept fresh bitter aroma created marriage lavender oakmoss labdanum given aromatic interest way minty geranium leaf sting camphor foug l aube much simple tread using great raw materials real oakmoss however true name means foug dawn scent opens burst sparkling lemon lavender sunny garrigue effect much brighter traditional foug opening led bergamot bitter green galbanum dry hay soon move darken foresty shadows though cool rosy minty sting geranium background oft cited reference scent ferns foug meaning fern french makes perfect sense really old school masculine canon strictly lovers classic foug res like azzaro pour homme brut crisp green scents green irish tweed,"lavender, oakmoss, geranium, citrus, hay, galbanum, costus, musk, sandalwood, camphor, amber, rose"

Chypre Azural Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"If you've long thought of the chypre category as dark and mysterious, think again. Chypre Azural is as juicy and fresh as the Sicilian Tarocco orange at its heart. Typically a contrast between fresh top notes and a mossy accord, that characteristic contrast can go in many directions, and in Chypre Azural it tips toward aromatic and bright, with patchouli grounding it in that family.
An intriguing tarragon note snakes its aromatic way around a subdued rose and prominent orange, drying down to a skin scent with substance thanks to an authentic ambergris tincture, which adds body, roundness, and a touch of shadow to its sunny nature. Unlike many citrus-forward scents that seem to disappear as soon as you spray them on, Chypre Azural sticks around, swirling and evolving on skin until it and you become one.","tarocco orange oil, centifolia rose absolute, patchouli, ambergris tincture, tarragon",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,long thought chypre category dark mysterious think chypre azural juicy fresh sicilian tarocco orange heart typically contrast fresh top notes mossy accord characteristic contrast go many directions chypre azural tips toward aromatic bright patchouli grounding family intriguing tarragon note snakes aromatic way around subdued rose prominent orange drying skin scent substance thanks authentic ambergris tincture adds body roundness touch shadow sunny nature unlike many citrus forward scents seem disappear soon spray chypre azural sticks around swirling evolving skin become one,"tarocco orange oil, centifolia rose absolute, patchouli, ambergris tincture, tarragon"
L'Eau des Sacres,Reims Parfums,"L'Eau des Sacres executes its leap between its cool-toned, aromatic opening and its warm, golden drydown so effortlessly that it feels like watching the prima ballerina at the Paris Opera performing a turn for you alone. Opening in a cloud of peppery violet-and-lavender brightness, the scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious, like wandering into a small, rustic French church at Easter and inhaling the scent of flowers and herbs being placed over nubbins of waxy, lemony frankincense. Wafts of honeyed orange blossom add to the spring-like delicacy and brightness.
It's in the basenotes that things take a seriously sensual tone. Dropping the aromatic herbs and petals of its opening, the scent dips us backwards into a warm bath of buttery, almond-inflected tonka bean, bolstered with a gorgeous 'buerre noisette' sandalwood. Lovers of Tonka ImpÃ riale will rejoice in this drydown similarly warm and comforting as the Guerlain, L'Eau des Sacres is perhaps even more natural-smelling and durable. A touch of ambergris adds an agreeably salty-fresh bitterness that keeps the sweetness in check. We think that that L'Eau des Sacres' 'a little from column A, a little from column B' approach creates the perfect all-season bridge between the freshness of aromatic spring florals and the buttery winter weight of tonka-fied amber.","pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,l'eau des sacres executes leap cool toned aromatic opening warm golden drydown effortlessly feels like watching prima ballerina paris opera performing turn alone opening cloud peppery violet lavender brightness scent feels ethereal yet unpretentious like wandering small rustic french church easter inhaling scent flowers herbs placed nubbins waxy lemony frankincense wafts honeyed orange blossom add spring like delicacy brightness basenotes things take seriously sensual tone dropping aromatic herbs petals opening scent dips us backwards warm bath buttery almond inflected tonka bean bolstered gorgeous 'buerre noisette' sandalwood lovers tonka imp riale rejoice drydown similarly warm comforting guerlain l'eau des sacres perhaps even natural smelling durable touch ambergris adds agreeably salty fresh bitterness keeps sweetness check think l'eau des sacres' 'a little column little column b' approach creates perfect season bridge freshness aromatic spring florals buttery winter weight tonka fied amber,"pink pepper, lavender, orange blossom, honey, rose, tonka bean, sandalwood, ambergris"
Awake Eau de Parfum,Akro,"The opening jolts you awake, like a loved one passing a freshly brewed espresso in front of your nose as you begin to nod off. Hot, black, intense roasted bean with the burnt edge of wood crackling in the grate. The green bite of cardamom giving it a tart edge. Awake's darkness is tantalizingly profound, but the perfumer has thoughtfully slipped a nugget of toasted hazelnut in with the coffee to buffer it from any sharpness or acridity. Awake manages that compromise between sharp and sweet so smoothly that you begin to imagine it's easy â but make no mistake, it is the experienced hand of Cresp that keeps the scent on an even keel. The dance of coffee, hazelnut, and toasted wood ebbs and flows through the scent like a steady pulse, before sweetening slightly, finishing out in a remarkably textured rendition of those crunchy coffee candies in the checkout aisle of Italian grocery stores. Not sweet, not particularly gourmand, and yet, also not bitter or grainy in that way that coffee scents can be, Awake is the happy medium of coffee scents.","balkans santos coffee, green cardamom, lemon, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,opening jolts awake like loved one passing freshly brewed espresso front nose begin nod hot black intense roasted bean burnt edge wood crackling grate green bite cardamom giving tart edge awake's darkness tantalizingly profound perfumer thoughtfully slipped nugget toasted hazelnut coffee buffer sharpness acridity awake manages compromise sharp sweet smoothly begin imagine easy make mistake experienced hand cresp keeps scent even keel dance coffee hazelnut toasted wood ebbs flows scent like steady pulse sweetening slightly finishing remarkably textured rendition crunchy coffee candies checkout aisle italian grocery stores sweet particularly gourmand yet also bitter grainy way coffee scents awake happy medium coffee scents,"balkans santos coffee, green cardamom, lemon, vetiver"
B683 Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois,"""I like the raw and yet so chic aspect of this perfume: a very refined and wild fragrance."" Quentin Bisch, perfumer.
B683 is a result of the meeting of two young designers. One is a couturier, the other a perfumer. Their childhood memories brought them together. Remembering captivating smells; of the leather from an elegant attache case or an immaculate desk blotter; of the distinct smells of wood during the regular gathering of fuel to warm the family home. The artistic skills of the former and the olfactory talent of the latter together sparked a magical and pleasant fragrance with its notes of spices, leather and wood. What We Think An oh-so-wearable leather scent that feels smoothly sophisticated but dynamically modern- the spice and woods add tone and energy without sacrificing elegance.","black pepper, saffron, chili pepper, nutmeg, violet leaf, amber, cistus absolute, musk, patchouli, santal wood, oakmoss, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like raw yet chic aspect perfume refined wild fragrance quentin bisch perfumer b result meeting two young designers one couturier perfumer childhood memories brought together remembering captivating smells leather elegant attache case immaculate desk blotter distinct smells wood regular gathering fuel warm family home artistic skills former olfactory talent latter together sparked magical pleasant fragrance notes spices leather wood think oh wearable leather scent feels smoothly sophisticated dynamically modern spice woods add tone energy without sacrificing elegance,"black pepper, saffron, chili pepper, nutmeg, violet leaf, amber, cistus absolute, musk, patchouli, santal wood, oakmoss, ambroxan"
Ramune (Japanese Soda) Eau de Parfum,J-Scent,"The nostalgic scent reminds you of the excitement when you pop open a ramune bottle sealed with a marble stopper at a summer festival.
The refreshing scent of ramune that cools your body on a hot summer night. This perfume starts with the clear notes of lemon, aldehyde and mint, then brings the gentle sweet notes of rose, lily of the valley and magnolia, eventually leaving behind the notes of musk and vanilla, relaxing the senses. This scent will evoke summer memories, lighting your heart with nostalgic dreamy summer lanterns. What We Think The distinctly bubblegummy flavor of Ramune comes through with evocative clarity- minty, fruity, fresh, and fun.","spearmint, peppermint, lemont squash, raspberry, bergamot, aldehyde, rose, muguet, water lily, magnolia, hyacinth, musk, amber, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/814006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nostalgic scent reminds excitement pop open ramune bottle sealed marble stopper summer festival refreshing scent ramune cools body hot summer night perfume starts clear notes lemon aldehyde mint brings gentle sweet notes rose lily valley magnolia eventually leaving behind notes musk vanilla relaxing senses scent evoke summer memories lighting heart nostalgic dreamy summer lanterns think distinctly bubblegummy flavor ramune comes evocative clarity minty fruity fresh fun,"spearmint, peppermint, lemont squash, raspberry, bergamot, aldehyde, rose, muguet, water lily, magnolia, hyacinth, musk, amber, cedarwood, sandalwood, vanilla"
Fille en Aiguilles Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"The name means ""Girls in Needles"" and pine needles at that, rather than chic talons aiguilles (stiletto heels)... But boys can roll around in them too: this is a decidedly non-gendered, atmospheric scent.
Pine essence is a risky bet in perfumery: its medicinal, turpentine fumes conjure household disinfectants or cough drops and are particularly hard to tame. Serge Lutens, never one to shirk a challenge, opted for playing them up rather than tamping them down: the result is uncharacteristically raw, almost minimalist. In Filles en Aiguilles, the powerful resinous smell of pine is compounded by the camphor blast of vetiver and a wisp of gunpowder incense. Fruity fir balsam and the trademark Lutens candied fruit notes sweeten the blend without playing down its dark green radiance. A searing afternoon in Mediterranean pine groves or a Californian forest; a Buddhist temple or Christmas morning; the hale aroma of a lumber yard; a painter's studio strewn with turpentine-soaked rags... Whatever memories Filles en Aiguilles conjures, this poignantly evocative, meditative potion will somehow feel healing. You'll need it this winter. What We Think The sweet aromatic freshness of pine sap and candied fruit makes this a joyfully nostalgic autumn fragrance.","pine needles, vetiver, sugary sap, laurel, fir balsam, frankincense, candied fruit spice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name means girls needles pine needles rather chic talons aiguilles stiletto heels boys roll around decidedly non gendered atmospheric scent pine essence risky bet perfumery medicinal turpentine fumes conjure household disinfectants cough drops particularly hard tame serge lutens never one shirk challenge opted playing rather tamping result uncharacteristically raw almost minimalist filles en aiguilles powerful resinous smell pine compounded camphor blast vetiver wisp gunpowder incense fruity fir balsam trademark lutens candied fruit notes sweeten blend without playing dark green radiance searing afternoon mediterranean pine groves californian forest buddhist temple christmas morning hale aroma lumber yard painter's studio strewn turpentine soaked rags whatever memories filles en aiguilles conjures poignantly evocative meditative potion somehow feel healing need winter think sweet aromatic freshness pine sap candied fruit makes joyfully nostalgic autumn fragrance,"pine needles, vetiver, sugary sap, laurel, fir balsam, frankincense, candied fruit spice"
Purple Haze Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""The fragrance Purple Haze embraces the hippie movement and counterculture just like John and Yoko's bed-ins in Amsterdam and Montreal. Purple Haze is about the legendary Keenak who I met in Bahama Village, Key West. Guitar on his back, snakeskin boots, skinny jeans, and long hair. A sense of Woodstock. It is a tribute to creativity, freedom, and indulgence."" -Johan Bergelin Since when did we all get so scared of smelling like a hippie? Unlike many of its patchouli-based contemporaries in niche fragrance, Purple Haze doesn't run away from the raw, earthy, evocative power of this misunderstood material. Instead, it delivers the wearer a heady, intoxicating, psychedelic fougere that mixes intensely fresh aromatic notes like cypress, cannabis, and thyme with a rich patchouli-woods-vanilla base for an extremely groovy trip back in time.

Over the Chocolate Shop Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"Once upon a time, 4160 Tuesdays magic-maker Sarah McCartney was inspired to create a chocolate scent by her friend's apartment, which was serendipitously perched atop a chocolate shop. The scent was everything a chocolate shop scent should be- rich, creamy, and delectable- but this was before Sarah had learned the ins and outs of perfume production, so the recipe went back in a drawer. Years later, it has been resurrected, and we're all the richer for it. Simply put, if you've been searching for the scent of real chocolate- not cookies, not cake, but a pure, decadent chocolate truffle- Over the Chocolate Shop may just be your holy grail. Every simple, mouthwatering ingredient- sumptuous cocoa butter, creamy vanilla, caramelized praline, a perfect sprinkle of coffee- blends seamlessly into a divine confection, a picture-perfect bonbon plucked from the window of a fairytale chocolatier, a single bite you'll remember for the rest of your life.

Eleventh Hour Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"It seems funny to say this, but Eleventh Hour is not the first fragrance we've carried based on the end of the world. It is, however, still quite a novelty- the first fragrance ever to feature an astonishing new note- Ban Timmur, a Nepalese plant related to Szechwan pepper, known for both intense, almost anesthetic spice but also unusually bright, citrussy tones. Don't worry if it's hard to imagine- the utterly unique note is the very first thing you'll smell on your initial spray, a combination of juicy citrus and sweet, spicy, clovelike tones for a note both thrillingly novel, but also possessed of a certain familiar holiday-spice styled comfort. The heart it leads into is every bit as original- spicy, earthy carrot seed set against sweetly seductive rum and juicy, wild fig. Warm, smooth tonka dominates the drydown, but the real wonder of 11th Hour is the pervasiveness of the Ban Timmur, lending the fragrance the sweet, rich spiciness of an opulent oriental scent, but with a distinctively fresh energy that lasts into the drydown. According to Byredo, featuring an ingredient from the imposing Nepalese highlands is a statement on the kind of inhospitable places humanity may eventually be forced to survive as ocean levels rise. Heavier stuff than a perfume description can necessarily grapple with, to be sure, but at least now we know that when the end of the world arrives, we're going to be smelling great, really, really, great.","ban timmur pepper, bergamot, carrot seed, rum, wild fig, tonka bean, cashmere woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/641101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,seems funny say eleventh hour first fragrance we've carried based end world however still quite novelty first fragrance ever feature astonishing new note ban timmur nepalese plant related szechwan pepper known intense almost anesthetic spice also unusually bright citrussy tones worry hard imagine utterly unique note first thing smell initial spray combination juicy citrus sweet spicy clovelike tones note thrillingly novel also possessed certain familiar holiday spice styled comfort heart leads every bit original spicy earthy carrot seed set sweetly seductive rum juicy wild fig warm smooth tonka dominates drydown real wonder th hour pervasiveness ban timmur lending fragrance sweet rich spiciness opulent oriental scent distinctively fresh energy lasts drydown according byredo featuring ingredient imposing nepalese highlands statement kind inhospitable places humanity may eventually forced survive ocean levels rise heavier stuff perfume description necessarily grapple sure least know end world arrives we're going smelling great really really great,"ban timmur pepper, bergamot, carrot seed, rum, wild fig, tonka bean, cashmere woods"
Sabbia Bianca Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Concentrated at a whopping 43% of pure perfume oil and playing host to some of the world's most exquisite natural floral absolutes, Sabbia Bianca is the Rolls Royce of the Big White Floral genre. The composition is uncluttered, with only four listed notes. That's because when you go to the trouble of sourcing the best and most expensive tuberose, ylang, and tiare, you want their beauty to be able to shine uninterrupted. Sabbia Bianca is the perfect fantasy of a tropical island in a bottle, complete with sugar-white sand, crystalline azure waters, and gently-swaying palm trees. Immediately upon application, you are plunged into a pool of lush, inviting coconut milk, its surface dotted with waxy tiare petals. The buttery tuberose and gardenia are huge, and so heavily narcotic that you feel as if you've sipped on moonshine made from tropical flowers. Although Sabbia Bianca is almost obscenely rich, flickers of a woody freshness here and there hold the perfume back from excessive sweetness - perhaps the banana leaf nuance in the ylang or the greenness of the violet. That said, keep in mind that just one drop of this super concentrated elixir is enough to radiate heady tropical warmth all day long. Our take on Sabbia Bianca is this: sometimes you have to go all out to experience perfection in a genre. And for us, Sabbia Bianca is worth the investment.","tuberose, violet, ylang-ylang, tiare",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33948.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,concentrated whopping pure perfume oil playing host world's exquisite natural floral absolutes sabbia bianca rolls royce big white floral genre composition uncluttered four listed notes that's go trouble sourcing best expensive tuberose ylang tiare want beauty able shine uninterrupted sabbia bianca perfect fantasy tropical island bottle complete sugar white sand crystalline azure waters gently swaying palm trees immediately upon application plunged pool lush inviting coconut milk surface dotted waxy tiare petals buttery tuberose gardenia huge heavily narcotic feel sipped moonshine made tropical flowers although sabbia bianca almost obscenely rich flickers woody freshness hold perfume back excessive sweetness perhaps banana leaf nuance ylang greenness violet said keep mind one drop super concentrated elixir enough radiate heady tropical warmth day long take sabbia bianca sometimes go experience perfection genre us sabbia bianca worth investment,"tuberose, violet, ylang-ylang, tiare"
Sundrunk Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""Woozy and warm from the sun, we shared an orange pop and watched the surfers' last lines of the day."" - Amy Obisbo.
Blindingly bright, captivatingly crisp, Sundrunk explodes onto the palate with electric notes of citrus spiked with a vibrantly herbaceous sheen. It's the rich, dizzy, warm-to-your-fingertips feeling of an afternoon running with friends in the blinding brightness, sharing toasts to life and youth and creativity, and collapsing in a tired, satisfied heap as the afternoon crawls by.

The Time Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"What a beautiful, refreshing tea scent! Fans of tea scents know that a good one is difficult to find; well, House of Oud's The Time is a good one. The opening of bergamot, chamomile, and wormwood note creates a superb green tea impression, uniquely fresh and bitter, but with a nutty hay-like undertone. Slowly, other types of tea notes start to feed into the scent, helping to round out the picture and fill in the gaps. Oolong tea adds a milkiness that softens the astringency of the green tea, rendering it cloudy, while a black tea note lends a smoky leathery nuance. Together, the combination of the different teas gives the scent a subtle roasted undertone. There's a series of contrasts at play here that works very well. The Time smells both fresh and comforting, milky and smoky, which all adds up to a sort of green-on-cream effect. The nubuck suede notes in the base tie it all together for an experience that feels like drinking a cup of green tea in an upmarket equestrian store, surrounded by the complex aromas of saddle leather, tea leaves, and even the polite suggestion of hay. We're confident that fans of refined leather-tea fragrances such as Memo's Eau de Memo and Hermes' Osmanthe Yunnan will find a new love in The Time.","bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,beautiful refreshing tea scent fans tea scents know good one difficult find well house oud's time good one opening bergamot chamomile wormwood note creates superb green tea impression uniquely fresh bitter nutty hay like undertone slowly types tea notes start feed scent helping round picture fill gaps oolong tea adds milkiness softens astringency green tea rendering cloudy black tea note lends smoky leathery nuance together combination different teas gives scent subtle roasted undertone there's series contrasts play works well time smells fresh comforting milky smoky adds sort green cream effect nubuck suede notes base tie together experience feels like drinking cup green tea upmarket equestrian store surrounded complex aromas saddle leather tea leaves even polite suggestion hay we're confident fans refined leather tea fragrances memo's eau de memo hermes' osmanthe yunnan find new love time,"bergamot, wormwood, chamomile, oolong tea, iris, lemon verbena, cedar, musk, amber, black tea"

Freeway Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"Freeway is the story that jumped, fully formed, into Sarah McCartney's mind when she visited Scent Bar one hot summer's day and stepped out onto the hot asphalt outside. A friend was just driving away, and the smell of his Maserati's exhaust mixed with the scent of the orange blossom in the air and the tang of hot, melting asphalt...Sarah was inspired then and there to create an urban take on orange blossom exclusively for Luckyscent, to help celebrate our 15th anniversary. The idea was to take the fresh, sugary brightness of orange blossom and sully it with a host of gritty, determinedly non-floral smells from an urban environment, making for a scent with a sexy kick in its tail: think flowers crushed under a rubber-soled sneaker. Sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil here for its plummy citrus aroma but also for its fuel-like facet; the result is sweet orange blossom water spilled on hot tar. For such a popular note, orange blossom is easy to get wrong â too sweet and it's juvenile, too honeyed and it can turn sleazy. Freeway does orange blossom right, pitched exactly halfway between bright and dark. Dry woods, tobacco, and grassy cannabis notes dry out the tarry orange blossom until it smells more like old paper and less like a flower. A light, foamy vanilla froths around the dry, papery notes for a result that smells like eating a thimbleful of insanely rich, perfumery orange blossom gelato in an antique book store. Urban and urbane, Freeway is the scent of L.A.'s future, when, as Sarah says,âÂall cars are solar powered and the Freeways have cycle lanes, orange groves, jasmine hedgerows, and picnic areas.","mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64623.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,freeway story jumped fully formed sarah mccartney's mind visited scent bar one hot summer's day stepped onto hot asphalt outside friend driving away smell maserati's exhaust mixed scent orange blossom air tang hot melting asphalt sarah inspired create urban take orange blossom exclusively luckyscent help celebrate th anniversary idea take fresh sugary brightness orange blossom sully host gritty determinedly non floral smells urban environment making scent sexy kick tail think flowers crushed rubber soled sneaker sarah uses mandarin petigrain oil plummy citrus aroma also fuel like facet result sweet orange blossom water spilled hot tar popular note orange blossom easy get wrong sweet juvenile honeyed turn sleazy freeway orange blossom right pitched exactly halfway bright dark dry woods tobacco grassy cannabis notes dry tarry orange blossom smells like old paper less like flower light foamy vanilla froths around dry papery notes result smells like eating thimbleful insanely rich perfumery orange blossom gelato antique book store urban urbane freeway scent l 's future sarah says cars solar powered freeways cycle lanes orange groves jasmine hedgerows picnic areas,"mandarin petitgrain, orange blossom, tobacco, rum, brandy, cannabis, woods, vanilla"
20 Mars 2022 Eau de Parfum,Rundholz Parfums,"What does the future smell like? Obviously, we'll have to wait to know for sure, but with 20MARS2022, Rundholz for the first time explores the scent of a date not yet reached- and they're reaching for the stars. Opening with an intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed with a bouquet of refined gourmand spice, delicately sweetened with a touch of fruit and a rich, but restrained floral heart. The true star, as with all Rundholz scents, is the deep, balsamic incense that emerges in the heart, rich and resinous, made lightly smoky with a touch of creme brulee vanilla and haylike Tonka bean, given a sensual animalic growl with civet and castoreum. Overall, the effect is enveloping, the kind of deep, wondrous incense scent where each sniff reveals a new facet. Sure, we know the ""Mars"" in 20Mars2022 refers to the month, and not the planet. But with a scent this out of this world, you'll have to forgive us for not always remembering that.","pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily of the valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,future smell like obviously we'll wait know sure mars rundholz first time explores scent date yet reached they're reaching stars opening intensely peppery explosion quickly warmed bouquet refined gourmand spice delicately sweetened touch fruit rich restrained floral heart true star rundholz scents deep balsamic incense emerges heart rich resinous made lightly smoky touch creme brulee vanilla haylike tonka bean given sensual animalic growl civet castoreum overall effect enveloping kind deep wondrous incense scent sniff reveals new facet sure know mars mars refers month planet scent world forgive us always remembering,"pink pepper, black pepper, saffron, lovage, cinnamon, strawberry, jasmine, lily valley, rose, frankincense, patchouli, vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood, nagarmotha, hay, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, musk, civet, ambergris, castoreum"
Une Amourette Roland Mouret Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"""An unforgettable love affair, "" Une Amourette is the result of a portentious conversation between Etat Libre d'Orange and groundbreaking fashion designer Roland Mouret. Every bit as iconoclastic in the world of design as ELDO is for French fragrance, Mouret's work demonstrate a preternatural eye for sensuality, flow and innovation, a gift for draping fabric over skin in the same way that Etienne de Swardt's fragrances drape the skin. So, of course, a collaboration was inevitable- but what a collaboration this is. Soft and romantic, yet striking and avant-garde, Une Amourette is a beautifully woodsy iris that wears like the most flattering couture you can imagine. It starts with the iris note- sharp but not stark, with just the right amount of floral lushness to allow the vanilla-tinged akigala wood to slowly develop underneath, adding a purringly seductive, subtly muscular form to the flowing silhouette of the scent. As it dries, the gentle earthiness of the iris further gives shape to the body beneath, evoking a softer-but still distinctive- carnality that has us positively swooning. Some partnerships are so obvious you wonder why they've taken so long to manifest, but in the case of Une Amourette, we think we know the answer- they wanted to keep us waiting.","iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47750.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,unforgettable love affair une amourette result portentious conversation etat libre d'orange groundbreaking fashion designer roland mouret every bit iconoclastic world design eldo french fragrance mouret's work demonstrate preternatural eye sensuality flow innovation gift draping fabric skin way etienne de swardt's fragrances drape skin course collaboration inevitable collaboration soft romantic yet striking avant garde une amourette beautifully woodsy iris wears like flattering couture imagine starts iris note sharp stark right amount floral lushness allow vanilla tinged akigala wood slowly develop underneath adding purringly seductive subtly muscular form flowing silhouette scent dries gentle earthiness iris gives shape body beneath evoking softer still distinctive carnality us positively swooning partnerships obvious wonder they've taken long manifest case une amourette think know answer wanted keep us waiting,"iris, akigala wood, vanilla, jasmine"
Le Cri De La Lumiere Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Inspired by the light towards which all beings reach out whether entering or leaving this world, Le Cri de la Lumiere employs a sparse framework of just three notes: ambrette, iris, and rose. But for all its elegant minimalism, this is a scent with plenty to say. Ambrette, with its tart nuances of green apple, pear, and grappa, is first to announce its presence, bathing the scent in a halo of crystalline light. The opening pitches high, with an almost citrusy sparkle. The iris note, at first rooty and then bready, moves in to flesh out the structure, like a length of suede draped over a metal chair. Comparisons between this perfume and another ambrette-iris composition, Chanel No. 18, are natural but Le Cri de la Lumiere is far brighter and drier affair, with a delicate sourness absent from the Chanel. As silvery as a glass of white vermouth, the scent gains a blush in its cheeks thanks to the late addition of rose. The ambrette wraps around the rose and iris, bedding them down in a soapy muskiness that feels both clean and sensual. The texture of this scent is dappled; in turns sheer and cloudy, bright and shaded, like a glass of Pastis into which a drop of water has just been stirred. Le Cri de la Lumiere is a fragrance with noble lineage: aristocratic, haughty, and a little mysterious.","ambrette, rose, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired light towards beings reach whether entering leaving world le cri de la lumiere employs sparse framework three notes ambrette iris rose elegant minimalism scent plenty say ambrette tart nuances green apple pear grappa first announce presence bathing scent halo crystalline light opening pitches high almost citrusy sparkle iris note first rooty bready moves flesh structure like length suede draped metal chair comparisons perfume another ambrette iris composition chanel natural le cri de la lumiere far brighter drier affair delicate sourness absent chanel silvery glass white vermouth scent gains blush cheeks thanks late addition rose ambrette wraps around rose iris bedding soapy muskiness feels clean sensual texture scent dappled turns sheer cloudy bright shaded like glass pastis drop water stirred le cri de la lumiere fragrance noble lineage aristocratic haughty little mysterious,"ambrette, rose, iris"
Wulong Cha Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Wulong Cha is a vibrant, woody fig tea with a refreshing twist of citrus to give it sparkle. It opens with an Earl Grey type of freshness, with black tea leaves oily with bergamot, orange, and an exotic, fruity lift that is not immediately identifiable (that would be the litchi). But the heart is pure Oolong: a smoky tea full of delicate, nutty roasted flavors, and a slight but noticeable milkiness. The introduction of the fig note in the heart adds to this impression of milkiness; it smells beautifully like a freshly snapped fig leaf, green and oozing with fig sap.
What a lovely balance of tannins, fruit, and milk this is. We like Wulong Cha because it has both the clean, fresh transparency we've come to expect from great tea fragrances, but also a sweet, figgy milkiness that rounds off any sharp corners.

Guimauve de Noel Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Selected by Denyse Beaulieu to feature in her top 10 of 2016 for Grain de Musc, Guimauve de Noel is a pillowy marshmallow scent flavored with orange flower water and dusted in enough powdered sugar to make your teeth ache. But while it reminds us most pleasurably of fougassette, a type of bread fragrant with orange flower water sold in every market in Provence, this is not at all a heavy, gluttonous fragrance. Rather, it is a tender puff of orange flower-scented air with the sparkle of sugar crystals. It has a very French character, reminiscent both of those little chouquettes eaten by French schoolchildren at snack time, as well as the milky vapors of their evening baths, orange flower water sprinkled liberally into the water by Maman.

Palermo Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"In the ancient Mediterranean city of Palermo, the regional capital of Sicily, the orange trees that Berber and Moorish emirs planted long ago still grow. Their bergamot and bigarade fruits light up Byredo's Palermo, a scent as close to olfactory happiness as you can get, a perfume played in the highest, brightest keys.
Palermo's citrus grove sits alongside a rose garden, its rose bushes greened up in spring with the smell of crushed orange tree leaves and sliced fruits: lemon, lime, grapefruit, and maybe even aromatic pomelo. In its opening, an effervescent freshness of citrus juice is layered with cut citrus rinds, their zest oils conveying a more intense richness, bitterness, and spice.
During your walk in the garden, as the sun warms your skin, a warm musk rises up, slightly powdery, softening the bracing freshness of the hesperidic top notes of Palermo and helping the freshness to linger with the warmth. This is a unisex fragrance perfect for warmer months.","bergamot, bigarade, fresh rose absolute, skin musk, ambrette flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ancient mediterranean city palermo regional capital sicily orange trees berber moorish emirs planted long ago still grow bergamot bigarade fruits light byredo's palermo scent close olfactory happiness get perfume played highest brightest keys palermo's citrus grove sits alongside rose garden rose bushes greened spring smell crushed orange tree leaves sliced fruits lemon lime grapefruit maybe even aromatic pomelo opening effervescent freshness citrus juice layered cut citrus rinds zest oils conveying intense richness bitterness spice walk garden sun warms skin warm musk rises slightly powdery softening bracing freshness hesperidic top notes palermo helping freshness linger warmth unisex fragrance perfect warmer months,"bergamot, bigarade, fresh rose absolute, skin musk, ambrette flower"
Sorriso Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"A delicious and sophisticated gourmand scent built on the always-enticing combination of chocolate and orange. The bitter orange opening is bright and sharp and does not fade away, but melds beautifully with the intense and luscious chocolate note that dominates the blend. The notes list bitter chocolate, but it does not have the aggressive bite of unsweetened baker's squares. Instead it reminds us of fine, European bittersweet cocoa powder â like Valrhona or Callebaut â rich and dark, with just a hint of sweetness. Dusted over fresh orange and velvety woods (and perhaps a creamy vanilla-tinged note, as well), this is a luxurious, grown-up cocoa with no marshmallows in sight. Sorriso is one of the most elegant chocolate scents we have ever encountered. It isn't sugary or buttery and it doesn't juxtapose the edible elements with surprising, jarring notes. It is smooth and balanced, earning its sophistication by embracing the bitter elements of chocolate, as well as the sweet, and by using soft, soothing wood as an anchor. Sorriso means smile and this fragrance will surely evoke many of them.","bitter chocolate, bitter orange, exotic woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33938.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,delicious sophisticated gourmand scent built always enticing combination chocolate orange bitter orange opening bright sharp fade away melds beautifully intense luscious chocolate note dominates blend notes list bitter chocolate aggressive bite unsweetened baker's squares instead reminds us fine european bittersweet cocoa powder like valrhona callebaut rich dark hint sweetness dusted fresh orange velvety woods perhaps creamy vanilla tinged note well luxurious grown cocoa marshmallows sight sorriso one elegant chocolate scents ever encountered sugary buttery juxtapose edible elements surprising jarring notes smooth balanced earning sophistication embracing bitter elements chocolate well sweet using soft soothing wood anchor sorriso means smile fragrance surely evoke many,"bitter chocolate, bitter orange, exotic woods"

Korrigan Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Korrigan is less harmless than it looks. This caramel wood is no perfume from childhood; it is a scent of intimacy, insidiously musky and irresistible on the skin of a desired being. It is the fragrance of the senses set free, to be shared or saved for intimate moments, when caresses follow on sweet whispers and bodies draw closer. It is an invitation to voluptuousness, to sensuous pleasures, and to fantasies of the most extravagant kind.
Perfumer Thomas Fontaine first of all imagined a tree for Lubin, to be called ""Caramel Wood"". Its sap would be sweet like English toffee, but with tangy accents of wild apple, juniper and saffron, to answer for some of its mystery. He wanted a note of leather yet appetising, smooth like a whisky cream liqueur, yet smoky, fragrant and slightly bitter like superb pure malt.","juniper berry, saffron, cognac, lavender, ambrette, whiskey, cedar, oud, leather, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31220.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,korrigan less harmless looks caramel wood perfume childhood scent intimacy insidiously musky irresistible skin desired fragrance senses set free shared saved intimate moments caresses follow sweet whispers bodies draw closer invitation voluptuousness sensuous pleasures fantasies extravagant kind perfumer thomas fontaine first imagined tree lubin called caramel wood sap would sweet like english toffee tangy accents wild apple juniper saffron answer mystery wanted note leather yet appetising smooth like whisky cream liqueur yet smoky fragrant slightly bitter like superb pure malt,"juniper berry, saffron, cognac, lavender, ambrette, whiskey, cedar, oud, leather, vetiver, musk"
Bois d'Ascese Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir,"A meditative swirl of serene incense, intensified by smoked wood. At first, this brings to mind a stark, secluded chapel and a life of plain and simple pleasures. But as it develops, notes of whiskey, tobacco and cinnamon begin to shimmer through the incense, and you start to think that perhaps these pleasures won't be quite so plain, after all. If you have ever enjoyed a fine Islay Scotch whiskey, such as Lagavulin or Laphroaig, you are familiar with the way the intricacies of smoke and moss add a complicated and enigmatic appeal harsh and medicinal one moment, mesmerizing the next. The layers of smoked cade wood, oakmoss and whiskey have a similar effect here, as bracing jolts of smoke morph into the airy tranquility of incense, keeping us endlessly intrigued and hopelessly addicted. A starkly elegant fragrance that puts us in a trance.","tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59301.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,meditative swirl serene incense intensified smoked wood first brings mind stark secluded chapel life plain simple pleasures develops notes whiskey tobacco cinnamon begin shimmer incense start think perhaps pleasures quite plain ever enjoyed fine islay scotch whiskey lagavulin laphroaig familiar way intricacies smoke moss add complicated enigmatic appeal harsh medicinal one moment mesmerizing next layers smoked cade wood oakmoss whiskey similar effect bracing jolts smoke morph airy tranquility incense keeping us endlessly intrigued hopelessly addicted starkly elegant fragrance puts us trance,"tobacco, whiskey, cinnamon, amber, cistus labdanum, oakmoss, smoked cade wood, incense"
Philosykos - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"One of the best fig scents ever made and one of our favorite scents of all time, now even stronger and more compelling. This ode to the fig groves of Greece is still a very green fig â a fig just on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play â sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove â the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens.

Jardin du Poete Eau de Toilette,Eau d'Italie,"Eau d'Italie teams up again with Bertrand Duchaufour for this lyrical interpretation of an al fresco dinner in a Sicilian garden. Orange in every tone âÂ tart, bitter, sweet â is livened up with grapefruit, whose raspy, slightly sulfurous facets are underlined with cassis and the minty buchu leaf; basil conjures the aromatic herbal garden. These green facets, as well as the rosy undertones of the grapefruit segue into the green, watery, rose-like cyclamen, a natural companion to lily of the valley and rose providing a rich, moist, floral counterpoint to the sparkle of citrus... Immortelle, moss and hay conjure the heat exhaled by vegetation as the sun sets after a warm summer day.

Eau Duelle - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"Eau Duelle is a vibrant dash of cold spices - cardamom, pink peppercorn and saffron - and the intoxicating juniper essence hits new heights with fresh cypress and elemi aromatic tinges. Then the vanilla emerges triumphant against the light and dark backdrop.
On the one hand, there is ethereal, epicurean and powdery Firnat vanilla, its enthralling sweetness exalted by paradisone - a Firmenich captive molecule akin to an infinitely pure hedione - and by white, sweet and enveloping musks.
On the other, there is original and mysterious bourbon vanilla. It is slightly smoked and almost syrupy. Vetiver, African frankincense smoke, and animal and leathery twists from Asian cypriol purify it. A spice trail necessarily travels through places where unexpected exchanges occur.
The gatecrashers here are black tea from Ceylon and the famous calamus reed, the tasty revealers that make the journey singular, memorable and priceless. Eau Duelle will delight anyone who dreams of breathing vanilla with a different tinge.

Tilda Swinton Like This Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"With Like This, Etat Libre d'Orange pays homage to the intelligent and surreally beautiful actress Tilda Swinton. Etat's challenge was immediate: to create a fragrance that reflects Swinton's uncommon grace and talent. Like Swinton, the fragrance needed to be unusual yet welcoming, delicate yet strong, seductive without being distracting, and full of radiance. With Like This, they succeeded. Like This is unlike any other fragrance we've smelled, and yet it is as comfortable and warm as a summer afternoon in the Scottish hillside.
The fragrance opens with a juicy hit of neroli and mandarin, and it is quickly balanced by the earthiness of pumpkin flesh, a note rarely found in perfume. A thread of exotic immortelle and powdered ginger add both sweetness and spice to the composition. But don't think Like This smells like the pantry â a lush bouquet of rose, heliotrope, and green vetiver are the foundation on which the scent is built, and a hint of clean musk adds intimacy. Like This wears for hours, yet stays close to the skin. Like This follows Swinton's lead in breaking artistic convention. The only real way to understand either of them is to experience them.","yellow mandarin, ginger, pumpkin accord, immortelle, neroli, rose de grasse, vetiver, heliotrope, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like etat libre d'orange pays homage intelligent surreally beautiful actress tilda swinton etat's challenge immediate create fragrance reflects swinton's uncommon grace talent like swinton fragrance needed unusual yet welcoming delicate yet strong seductive without distracting full radiance like succeeded like unlike fragrance we've smelled yet comfortable warm summer afternoon scottish hillside fragrance opens juicy hit neroli mandarin quickly balanced earthiness pumpkin flesh note rarely found perfume thread exotic immortelle powdered ginger add sweetness spice composition think like smells like pantry lush bouquet rose heliotrope green vetiver foundation scent built hint clean musk adds intimacy like wears hours yet stays close skin like follows swinton's lead breaking artistic convention real way understand either experience,"yellow mandarin, ginger, pumpkin accord, immortelle, neroli, rose de grasse, vetiver, heliotrope, musk"
Nio Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"Xerjoff describes Nio as ""A refreshing walk through the south Italian countryside"" and they couldn't be more right. Wearing Nio, we imagine strolling down a shady, cypress-lined lane in the height of summer, just before the sun sets. It's that special time between day and night, the time the French refer to as the blue hour. A slight breeze lifts from a nearby ocean, cooling the warm air and mingling with the fresh, herbal scent of the trees and their woody bark. Soon night will fall and the crickets will begin to chirp. We're thinking of the chilled Campari and good company waiting at the villa just ahead. Nio opens with a mouthwatering blend of rich neroli and Calabrian bergamot before deepening into its resinous, green heart. Hints of spice, pepper, and dry cedar enliven the composition, and vetiver keeps Nio's refreshing fragrance grounded. Unlike many green, earthy fragrances, Nio doesn't fade into a vague woody shadow. Instead, it retains its refined vivaciousness for hours and hours, alternately showing its uplifting then mysterious aspects. Nio is the rare fragrance that is fresh without being jarring and elegant without being stuffy.","neroli, bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, green leaves, cedar, gaiac wood, vetiver, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,xerjoff describes nio refreshing walk south italian countryside right wearing nio imagine strolling shady cypress lined lane height summer sun sets special time day night time french refer blue hour slight breeze lifts nearby ocean cooling warm air mingling fresh herbal scent trees woody bark soon night fall crickets begin chirp we're thinking chilled campari good company waiting villa ahead nio opens mouthwatering blend rich neroli calabrian bergamot deepening resinous green heart hints spice pepper dry cedar enliven composition vetiver keeps nio's refreshing fragrance grounded unlike many green earthy fragrances nio fade vague woody shadow instead retains refined vivaciousness hours hours alternately showing uplifting mysterious aspects nio rare fragrance fresh without jarring elegant without stuffy,"neroli, bergamot, cardamom, nutmeg, pink pepper, green leaves, cedar, gaiac wood, vetiver, patchouli, amber"

Created by Olivia Giacobetti, this is a very green fig â a fig on the verge of being ripe. The opening is sharp with the tart freshness of the leaves, and then the fig itself comes into play â sweet enough to tantalize, but not overwhelm. The glossy green leaves and succulent fruit intertwine with a dry wood note and a hint of rich earth. You get the sense not only of the whole tree, but the whole grove â the wood, the earth, the sky, the Mediterranean sun coaxing the sweetness of the fruit along as it ripens.

Jubilation XXV Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Unabashedly opulent. There is nothing minimal about this celebratory elixir and we couldn't be happier about that. Let's face it, sometimes more is more. Jubilation XXV features the prized frankincense of the Sultanate of Oman, but this is not a meditative, stone cathedral type of incense fragrance. This is a lavish bazaar, packed to the brim with all of the treasures of 1001 nights. The silver frankincense weaves through burnished woods, luscious fruits and blood-warming spices. It teases the elusive rock rose and the ever-so-grand orchid and wraps itself around luxurious opoponax and amber. The opening is sweet and honeyed, with a hint of bitterness that reminds us of the aftertaste that lets you know when a fruity liqueur is going to pack a wallop. (Fans of Frapin 1270 may want to join us in enjoying this deep and satisfying fruity booziness). As the scent mellows, it becomes richer and the wood notes become prominent. In spite of the litany of intense and dark-sounding notes, this never becomes gothic or moody. The aura is warm and velvety and extremely content, like you are leaning against a great golden lion who is purring like a race car. This is designed for men, yet somewhere deep down inside we know there is no way the women of the world are going to let the guys keep something this fantastic all to themselves.","frankincense, labdanum ciste, coriander, davana, blackberry, orange, gaicwood, rose, honey, bay, orchid, cinnamon, clove, celery seed, opoponox, patchouli, myrrh, musk, moss, cedarwood, ambergris, oud, immortelle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,unabashedly opulent nothing minimal celebratory elixir happier let's face sometimes jubilation xxv features prized frankincense sultanate oman meditative stone cathedral type incense fragrance lavish bazaar packed brim treasures nights silver frankincense weaves burnished woods luscious fruits blood warming spices teases elusive rock rose ever grand orchid wraps around luxurious opoponax amber opening sweet honeyed hint bitterness reminds us aftertaste lets know fruity liqueur going pack wallop fans frapin may want join us enjoying deep satisfying fruity booziness scent mellows becomes richer wood notes become prominent spite litany intense dark sounding notes never becomes gothic moody aura warm velvety extremely content like leaning great golden lion purring like race car designed men yet somewhere deep inside know way women world going let guys keep something fantastic,"frankincense, labdanum ciste, coriander, davana, blackberry, orange, gaicwood, rose, honey, bay, orchid, cinnamon, clove, celery seed, opoponox, patchouli, myrrh, musk, moss, cedarwood, ambergris, oud, immortelle"

Magenta Pop Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"To Prin Lomros, the hopes and fears, triumphs and failures of young love can be represented by a somewhat unlikely avatar: pop rocks. It's not as crazy as it might seem- aside from being a reliable source of childhood nostalgia, the fizzy, exploding candy is just like the experiences that make up the romantic awakening of adolescence: sweet, painful, exciting, unpredictable, and fleeting. This is the concept behind Magenta Pop, a candy-inspired summer scent of sweet, juicy, occasionally painful romance. Magenta Pop is built around grape, but not the fruity dimensionality of a wine or table grape- the flattened purple sweetness of the ubiquitous candy flavor, syrupy and indulgent. Contrast, therefore, comes with the electric spices meant to convey the crackle of the candy: black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, ginger.

Haxan Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Haxan is an ode to the ancient practices of sorcery, magic, alchemy and witchcraft. It is inspiredby Benjamin Christensen's 1922 seminal film on this subject.The perfume uses over 100 ingredients that are traditionally represented in potions and elixirs associated with these practices. Created as a bespoke perfume for Rajesh Balkrishnan by Prin Lomros, Haxan is a dark witchy fougere style perfume which incorporates dark woody and aromatic elements on a mossy bed representative of the ambience of the smells of places where dark occult ceremonies were conducted.
The perfume uses three blends of natural lavender oil surrounded by woody resinous birch, cedar, fir, guaiac, cypriol, sandalwood, wormwood, styrax and pine needle. There are spicy and herbal notes of saffron, thyme, rosemary, black pepper, nutmeg, caraway, cinnamon, violet leaf, tobacco, mushroom, basil, marjoram, and vetiver. Also present are faint animalic notes of civet, leather, musk, castoreum, beeswax, seaweed and hyrax that finally lead to a mossy powdery bed of moss, patchouli, labdanum, jasmine, olibanum, opoponax, chamomile, and galbanum. The perfume exudes an air of aromatic mystery and is a shape shifting marvel that ebbs and flows in alternate hues of dark and light.
In spite of its dense and dark notes, this is a surprisingly wearable and not overly intense concoction that takes you on a ride into the dark unknown of magic and ancient practices of the surreal considered heretic and profane.","chamomile, saffron, galbanum, lavender, rosemary, clary sage, marjoram, wormwood, sage, jasmine absolute, cypress absolute, fir balsam, spruce, beeswax absolute, elemi, thyme, basil, oregano, incense, labdanum, goat hair tincture, styrax, opoponax, nutmeg, gaiac, clove, black pepper, caraway, tobacco absolute, castoreum, cedar, sandalwood, cashmeran, mushroom, vetiver, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,haxan ode ancient practices sorcery magic alchemy witchcraft inspiredby benjamin christensen's seminal film subject perfume uses ingredients traditionally represented potions elixirs associated practices created bespoke perfume rajesh balkrishnan prin lomros haxan dark witchy fougere style perfume incorporates dark woody aromatic elements mossy bed representative ambience smells places dark occult ceremonies conducted perfume uses three blends natural lavender oil surrounded woody resinous birch cedar fir guaiac cypriol sandalwood wormwood styrax pine needle spicy herbal notes saffron thyme rosemary black pepper nutmeg caraway cinnamon violet leaf tobacco mushroom basil marjoram vetiver also present faint animalic notes civet leather musk castoreum beeswax seaweed hyrax finally lead mossy powdery bed moss patchouli labdanum jasmine olibanum opoponax chamomile galbanum perfume exudes air aromatic mystery shape shifting marvel ebbs flows alternate hues dark light spite dense dark notes surprisingly wearable overly intense concoction takes ride dark unknown magic ancient practices surreal considered heretic profane,"chamomile, saffron, galbanum, lavender, rosemary, clary sage, marjoram, wormwood, sage, jasmine absolute, cypress absolute, fir balsam, spruce, beeswax absolute, elemi, thyme, basil, oregano, incense, labdanum, goat hair tincture, styrax, opoponax, nutmeg, gaiac, clove, black pepper, caraway, tobacco absolute, castoreum, cedar, sandalwood, cashmeran, mushroom, vetiver, patchouli, musk"

Tuberose & Moss Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"With striking facets that range from innocently soft to sinfully carnal, tuberose is a grand dame of perfumery, a floral that a perfumer could dedicate a lifetime to. And Manuel Cross' third installment of tuberose is his most creative yet: while Flos Mortis was a snarling bouquet of indole (and Champs Lunaires a smooth and gentle dream), Tuberose & Moss focuses on tuberose's sweet, fruity elements, and in doing so demonstrates that this complex floral can do joyful and bright just as well as dark or soft. And what better base to showcase the sunshine than a classically inflected chypre? Here, Cross plays a fruity, creamy tuberose- delivering the brightness and sweetness that traditionally come from citrus and resin- against a beautiful base of soft, green, real oakmoss. Touches of spice, vanilla, and woods round out the rich dimensionality of the tuberose, and a traditional note of labdanum keeps the tuberose tethered to a chypre structure. Yet again, Manuel Cross has given us a scent that shows us that while both beautiful raw materials or inspired creativity can produce a great fragrance, it's the intersection of the two that can truly speak to the spirit.","tuberose, oakmoss, vanilla cream, allspice berries, cedar, labdanum, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,striking facets range innocently soft sinfully carnal tuberose grand dame perfumery floral perfumer could dedicate lifetime manuel cross' third installment tuberose creative yet flos mortis snarling bouquet indole champs lunaires smooth gentle dream tuberose moss focuses tuberose's sweet fruity elements demonstrates complex floral joyful bright well dark soft better base showcase sunshine classically inflected chypre cross plays fruity creamy tuberose delivering brightness sweetness traditionally come citrus resin beautiful base soft green real oakmoss touches spice vanilla woods round rich dimensionality tuberose traditional note labdanum keeps tuberose tethered chypre structure yet manuel cross given us scent shows us beautiful raw materials inspired creativity produce great fragrance intersection two truly speak spirit,"tuberose, oakmoss, vanilla cream, allspice berries, cedar, labdanum, musk"

La Surprise Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Inspired by The Pursuit, one of four paintings that make up Jean-Honore Fragonard's ""The Process of Love"" collection, La Surprise is a bright and striking vintage-inflected feminine scent. The painting, meant to depict the first stage of love- courtship- shows a bold young man emerging into a garden where three young ladies are playing in a fountain, offering a rose to his beloved, who turns away in surprise. It's a painting of clever nuance, the outcome uncertain to all involved, from the unsteady suitor to the blushing courtesan to even the apprehensive cherub sculptures who loom above. It's a message, perhaps, about the risks one must take to find love, but also the triumphs that only such risks can produce. As such, La Surprise is a burst of bright, elegant energy, opening with a lovely spicy-green accord that would feel at home among the most romantic French chypres of years past. A heart of luscious white florals meets the timeless pairing of peach and a touch of solar aldehyde, while The Pursuit's singular rose stands out as if carried on the breeze. In appropriately vintage fashion, the base is musky in the traditional use of the term, with enough of a warm, furry animalic purr to evoke the very real desire that lays beneath our subjects' interaction. Parfums MDCI have proven their skill in exploring every facet of France's rich fragrance history; with La Surprise, they gift us with a classically green feminine floral that would be right at home a century ago.","green accord, cardamom, white flowers, rose, peach, woody accord, musk, solar notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36526.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired pursuit one four paintings make jean honore fragonard's process love collection la surprise bright striking vintage inflected feminine scent painting meant depict first stage love courtship shows bold young man emerging garden three young ladies playing fountain offering rose beloved turns away surprise painting clever nuance outcome uncertain involved unsteady suitor blushing courtesan even apprehensive cherub sculptures loom message perhaps risks one must take find love also triumphs risks produce la surprise burst bright elegant energy opening lovely spicy green accord would feel home among romantic french chypres years past heart luscious white florals meets timeless pairing peach touch solar aldehyde pursuit's singular rose stands carried breeze appropriately vintage fashion base musky traditional use term enough warm furry animalic purr evoke real desire lays beneath subjects' interaction parfums mdci proven skill exploring every facet france's rich fragrance history la surprise gift us classically green feminine floral would right home century ago,"green accord, cardamom, white flowers, rose, peach, woody accord, musk, solar notes"
L'Aimee Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"L'Aimee or ""The Beloved"", is a famous 1794 oil portrait from French master Jacques-Louis David depicting his sister-in-law Madam Seriziat. Painted shortly after his release from Robespierre's prisons following the French Revolution, this masterwork is renowned for its effortless depiction of the subject's humanity, portraying Madam Seriziat holding a bouquet in one hand and her child's hand in the other. Its use of soft, warm color, as well as subtle touches of exquisite detail on the subject's hands and face, work together to evoke emotional depth and authenticity that transcend mere photorealism- beneath the surface, this painting truly breathes. What a delight, therefore, that Parfums MDCI has taken its subject to heart, delivering a fragrance that also glows with abundant humanity and warmth. Despite a complex notes list of citrus, fine florals, and rich woods, resins, and musks, L'Aimee turns out to be a fragrance of exquisitely blended softness and light. In a sense, it feels classical in its romantic depth, but it surprisingly carries none of the room-filling ostentatiousness one might expect from the notes- there are no sharp edges, no operatic swells and transitions- instead, it's the lush romance of a perfectly tuned chamber orchestra. Florals and woods all float on a cloud of pillow-soft musk and vanilla, aglow with the natural light of sweet fruit and the gentlest touch of castoreum. The result is a fragrance for romantics of all ages, youthful enough for a princess, elegant enough for a queen. Though for Monsieur David's sake, we should point out one needn't support the monarchy to enjoy it.","bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, rose, jasmine, champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musk, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,l'aimee beloved famous oil portrait french master jacques louis david depicting sister law madam seriziat painted shortly release robespierre's prisons following french revolution masterwork renowned effortless depiction subject's humanity portraying madam seriziat holding bouquet one hand child's hand use soft warm color well subtle touches exquisite detail subject's hands face work together evoke emotional depth authenticity transcend mere photorealism beneath surface painting truly breathes delight therefore parfums mdci taken subject heart delivering fragrance also glows abundant humanity warmth despite complex notes list citrus fine florals rich woods resins musks l'aimee turns fragrance exquisitely blended softness light sense feels classical romantic depth surprisingly carries none room filling ostentatiousness one might expect notes sharp edges operatic swells transitions instead lush romance perfectly tuned chamber orchestra florals woods float cloud pillow soft musk vanilla aglow natural light sweet fruit gentlest touch castoreum result fragrance romantics ages youthful enough princess elegant enough queen though monsieur david's sake point one support monarchy enjoy,"bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, rose, jasmine, champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musk, castoreum"

Bohemian Lime Parfum Concentrate,Goldfield & Banks,"As one of the easternmost points on the Australian mainland, the gorgeous beaches of Byron Bay are known as the place where Australia first meets the daily sun. It's also home to the Australian finger lime, a small, multicolored citrus fruit treasured for its potently tangy flavor and unique appearance. While the finger lime has long been a lucrative culinary crop, its distinctive citrus character and rich, fragrant oil has never been utilized in perfumery- until now. Featuring invigorating, sun-drenched finger lime as the focal point of a robustly fresh and spicy masculine, Goldfield & Banks has once again delivered a summer scent as strikingly unique as it is easy to love.

Coup de Foudre Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"Coup de Foudre certainly earns its lightning-inspired name in the opening burst, a brightly colored flash of juicy, sweet citrus and fresh, younger florals. Indeed, the combination of fresh bergamot, bitter grapefruit and sweet orange atop sunny champaca and lush jasmine is a spectacular bouquet unto itself, the kind of gorgeous natural blend that makes you look to the skies as surely as an incandescent streak of electricity across the horizon.

Oud Stars - Alexandria III Parfum,Xerjoff,"The Alexandria series is a true achievement for Xerjoff, an elegant series of fragrances based around a rich core of exquisite florals and highest quality ouds from Southeast Asia. Each version plays out with virtuosic grandeur, finding bold new resonance in its variation- a true testament to the legendary opulence of history's greatest metropolis. For Alexandria III, the composition keeps the same notes, but shifts away from the fruit-soaked vivaciousness of previous incarnations in favor of an even richer and woodsier blend.
Originally a limited edition of only 99 bottles, each encrusted in golden crystals, Alexandria III is no less radiant in its stunning new packaging. Lavender is still prominent in the opening, but now it brightens a warmer, richer heart of rosewood and lush, narcotic Bulgarian rose, softened with just the right touch of lily of the valley. The oud is every bit as profound as it was in previous iterations, but in III it leaves behind the animalic potency to follow the warm, powdered contours of a base of amber and rich sandalwood that will be wonderfully familiar to fans of Xerjoff's masterpiece Richwood. But make no mistake- with its luscious floral glow, Alexandria III is a masterwork all its own.","palisander rosewood, lavender, cinnamon, rose, cedar, lily of the valley, oud, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51154.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,alexandria series true achievement xerjoff elegant series fragrances based around rich core exquisite florals highest quality ouds southeast asia version plays virtuosic grandeur finding bold new resonance variation true testament legendary opulence history's greatest metropolis alexandria iii composition keeps notes shifts away fruit soaked vivaciousness previous incarnations favor even richer woodsier blend originally limited edition bottles encrusted golden crystals alexandria iii less radiant stunning new packaging lavender still prominent opening brightens warmer richer heart rosewood lush narcotic bulgarian rose softened right touch lily valley oud every bit profound previous iterations iii leaves behind animalic potency follow warm powdered contours base amber rich sandalwood wonderfully familiar fans xerjoff's masterpiece richwood make mistake luscious floral glow alexandria iii masterwork,"palisander rosewood, lavender, cinnamon, rose, cedar, lily valley, oud, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla"

Ishtar Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Part of the joy of Rogue's dedication to exquisite natural materials- regulators be damned- is a spontaneity of creation that simply cannot come from synthetic-heavy, bottom-line-oriented mass market creations. Ishtar is a perfect example- originally conceived as an aromatic fresh scent with a woodsy base, it turned out quite a bit different, as Manuel Cross found that two of the notes meant for the background- a smoky, silvery frankincense and a sweet, resinous benzoin- kept rising to the top of the composition regardless of proportions. Luckily, he was able to realize the serendipity at play, and the result is a dynamic, gorgeous incense scent with a wonderfully fresh sweetness. Juniper and lily, perhaps the star players in a different fragrance, go to work here enhancing the brightest and cleanest aspects of the frankincense, helping massage the profile from cold, churchy starkness into something greener, fresher, and more exuberantly lively. Similarly, the benzoin blends perfectly with sweet, woodsy myrrh and a spot of sandalwood- not a rough edge to be found. If Ishtar wasn't meant to be an incense scent, it might not have turned out quite as planned. Then again, nothing truly inspired ever does.","frankincense, benzoin, juniper, myrrh, lily, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,part joy rogue's dedication exquisite natural materials regulators damned spontaneity creation simply cannot come synthetic heavy bottom line oriented mass market creations ishtar perfect example originally conceived aromatic fresh scent woodsy base turned quite bit different manuel cross found two notes meant background smoky silvery frankincense sweet resinous benzoin kept rising top composition regardless proportions luckily able realize serendipity play result dynamic gorgeous incense scent wonderfully fresh sweetness juniper lily perhaps star players different fragrance go work enhancing brightest cleanest aspects frankincense helping massage profile cold churchy starkness something greener fresher exuberantly lively similarly benzoin blends perfectly sweet woodsy myrrh spot sandalwood rough edge found ishtar meant incense scent might turned quite planned nothing truly inspired ever,"frankincense, benzoin, juniper, myrrh, lily, sandalwood, musk"

Flos Mortis Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Flos Mortis (flower of death) seems a bit dark and droll for a perfume concept but there is nothing dead or dull about it. This hardcore tuberose fragrance is a narcotic floral composed to be an indolic dirge, headed by tuberose and Indian jasmine. The composition focuses on Tuberose's indolic properties from both the fresh blossoms and the absolute. The indole note in Flos Mortis actually makes up 5% of the formula but is tempered with some Indian jasmine (grandiflorum) which shares similar indolic properties. The addition of red currant and osmanthus add some smooth and delicious fruitiness, while the raw black leather leather accord carries forth the rest of the animalic onslaught.
From its sweet, dark floral opening to its leathery mid-notes Flos Mortis is nowhere near conventional.

Sedley Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"A fragrance of unparalleled freshness and deceptive complexity, Sedley is a dynamically bright men's fragrance for those who know the power of confident subtlety. While it doesn't enter the room in front of you the way many of Parfums de Marly's powerhouse classics do, its bright, light aromatic citrus opening steadily develops on the skin into a beguiling woodsy masculine that hits its stride just as you hit yours. But first, a bit more about that opening- a hesperidic trio of mandarin, grapefruit, and lemon that combines the best of all three- tart, bright, juicy, and sharp, with the herbaceous, aromatic zing of mint and rosemary. Sedley's development is impressively judicious- the top notes linger well past a normal opening, and the classic gentleman's heart of lavender and geranium comes on so gradually that you may find yourself seduced by your own fragrance. And with that same deliberation, a warm, smooth, powerful base of musky woods emerges that hums on the skin with potent energy. It's often said that real men speak softly and let their actions do the talking. If that's you, Sedley is your fragrance.","mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, mint, rosemary, geranium, lavender, olibanum, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, cashmeran, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70033.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance unparalleled freshness deceptive complexity sedley dynamically bright men's fragrance know power confident subtlety enter room front way many parfums de marly's powerhouse classics bright light aromatic citrus opening steadily develops skin beguiling woodsy masculine hits stride hit first bit opening hesperidic trio mandarin grapefruit lemon combines best three tart bright juicy sharp herbaceous aromatic zing mint rosemary sedley's development impressively judicious top notes linger well past normal opening classic gentleman's heart lavender geranium comes gradually may find seduced fragrance deliberation warm smooth powerful base musky woods emerges hums skin potent energy often said real men speak softly let actions talking that's sedley fragrance,"mandarin, grapefruit, lemon, mint, rosemary, geranium, lavender, olibanum, sandalwood, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, cashmeran, ambroxan"
Tigerlust Pure Parfum,Ensar Oud,"Typically, perfumers have a vision in mind, be it a feeling they want to evoke or a marketing theme they have to match. It didn't work that way this time. This fragrance was simply born out of Ensar Oud's love of contrasts and experimentation. A curiosity to know what happens when frangipani oozes into orris root and civet gets high on Sichuan pepper. When crushed ambergris sticks to blackcurrant and castoreum goes for a swim in a lake of osmanthus. When obscene amounts of artisanal Chinese oud, Sri Lankan oud, and Maroke oud are poured into an animalic cocktail and then left to steep in vintage Timor sandalwood, tobacco leaf and coffee flower, you really just don't know what to expect. Enter Tigerlust. Primal, sensual âÂ sexual, even â this is what happens when Siberian musk comes into contact with gyrinops from the highest mountain peaks of Irian Jaya and they go for a stroll in the Italian countryside.
It's a fragrance you want to embrace; to make it a part of you every bit as much as the steaming presence of an untamed lover's skin. An enticing musk, with rose and jasmine hastening it's intrigue. The top notes are discreetly citrusy, the heart notes shamelessly saucy, and the base is all ouds slooshing drunk on oud, tempered by Mysore from the mid-70s. All the most expensive/sought-after/precious perfume ingredients here, waiting to be experienced. Decadent amounts of all of them in their most pristine form (100% natural, undiluted extracts), carefully proportioned not to let any one steal the show.

Sultan Musk Attar Perfume Oil,Ensar Oud,"All spiced up and sumptuous. A sensual, naturalistic aroma that smells of animal yet enthralls with its beauty. This is the scent of a passionate caress. From Siberian musk-infused Santal Royale to exotic pepper extracts that smell muskier than muskrat, splashes of post-coital sweat, grapefruit and animalics emerge that take you to a proper bestial muskiness accentuated by civet, cumin, and other highly problematic aromatics. They merge into an ultra-steroidal foundation for the floral notes. After the floral notes quieten, the soft basmati rice emerges, the baby skin effect of a perfect musky drydown.
A special Japanese rose injects the risque with enough romantique to let the scent share the bed with the ballroom; featured here alongside a trio of Himalayan, Turkish, and Edward roses. The floral tenor is sensual and richer than the most masterful soliflores but exalted further by the musk.

Spicematic Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","The joy of Pierre Guillaume's ""flanker"" scents is that they're anything but retreads of their original inspiration- instead they have the iterative energy of a maestro composing variations on a theme, using the constraints of a single concept to focus his energy on the serendipitous. In Spicematic 11.2, Guillaume revisits the ""aromatic-spice"" nexus that gave us the desert lemon mint and allspice of Harmatan Noir and the sub-tropical peppermint and cardamom of Indian Wood, but here, our inspiration is the cold, mineralic beauty of marble, represented in saffron, fresh ginger, and green mint. With a molecular distillation of incense adding an intense coolness, the fragrance shines and sparkles, tempered only by the organic vibration of red cedar and the resinous heat of Siberian pine.

Meet Me On The Corner Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"Meet Me On The Corner is a fragrance inspired by the 1970s but updated by about a half century. It's named after the Lindisfarne song, and captures the days when a date was just two people showing up to the same place at the same time- no texts, no swiping right, no GPS. It takes a staple of the '70s- the citrus chypre- and supplements the carefree excitement of the classic style with a serious dose of 2020 sophistication. The key to Meet Me On The Corner is three essential oils: mandora- a hybrid citrus born of sweet orange and mandarin, grown in Cyprus- plus magnolia flower, and magnolia leaf. Mandora gives the lemon and mandarin topnote a bright new sunshiny feeling. Using magnolia instead of the traditional tuberose and rosewood brings softness to the romantic heart of the scent. And in the base, all the hallmarks of a timeless chypre- moss, patchouli and styrax blended and matured in bergamot, surrounded by gentle musks. Think of this 1970-meets-2020 concept as a new Mini Cooper- all the fun of driving the original... now with working brakes and windshield wipers.","lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musk, styrax, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64626.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,meet corner fragrance inspired updated half century named lindisfarne song captures days date two people showing place time texts swiping right gps takes staple ' citrus chypre supplements carefree excitement classic style serious dose sophistication key meet corner three essential oils mandora hybrid citrus born sweet orange mandarin grown cyprus plus magnolia flower magnolia leaf mandora gives lemon mandarin topnote bright new sunshiny feeling using magnolia instead traditional tuberose rosewood brings softness romantic heart scent base hallmarks timeless chypre moss patchouli styrax blended matured bergamot surrounded gentle musks think meets concept new mini cooper fun driving original working brakes windshield wipers,"lemon, mandarin, mandora, clementine, magnolia flowers, magnolia leaves, sandalwood, bergamot, oakmoss, musk, styrax, patchouli"

Mriga Parfum,PRIN,"Mriga- from the Sanskrit word for ""deer."" Fear not, however, animal lovers, Mriga contains no actual deer musk, but simply an ingenious synthetic deer musk accord, perhaps the most accurate one we've ever smelled, able to impressively capture the subtly sweet, powdery, furry aspects of real musk with far more nuance than the average substitute. And Prin Lomros makes the most of this striking accord, supplementing it with an array of florals and resins designed both to evoke the natural Himalayas habitat that such a deer might find himself in, while also drawing out the aphrodisiac elements of deer musk that have brought the material such breathless renown. Lime teases out that ribbon of brightness that so often separates real musk from its imitators, while a root-to-leaf collage of arboreal fragrant materials- fir balsam, spruce, oakmoss, sandalwood- lend a striking natural dimensionality.

Phloem Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio,"What a sticky mess. Phloem is a diabolical assemblage of odorants that should oppose, but somehow attract.
There is a violent, primal sensuality that bewitches before embracing. The entire composition is a balancing act of contradicting raw materials blended instinctually to create a shocking and diffusive bouquet of devastating release. Phloem presents a miasma of olfactory sin; flushed skin, shoreline, carnival frivolities, caviar, lipstick smears and erogenous effluvium.

Nectary Eau de Parfum,Jorum Studio,"Nectary is a profusion of diaphanous flowers. A modern alternative to more traditional signatures.
This is a brutal floral bouquet, abundant with honeyed sweetness and oozing with precious sap. There is a beguiling tartness as Nectary unfurls.

Modelled on the concept of two people destined to cross paths, and the scents of the bustling street that leads them unknowingly towards one another, it's a rich, sweet floral oriental that perfectly captures the unmistakable buzz of an instant connection, where every small detail feels like it portends a bright and joyous future.

Allegretto 7.2 Eau de Parfum,Berceuse Parfum,"How does melancholy become beautiful? Listen to the stirring, sombre second movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony and imagine how it might smell. Dark, sweeping, poignant: this is Allegretto 7.2.
A study in theme and variations, Allegretto is built around Haitian vetiver that brightens and darkens as it develops, layering earthy scents, smoke, and lavender.
Allegretto 7.2's notes recede and repeat rhythmically. A fresh mint top note poises in the air like a conductor's baton, soon giving way to swirls of smoke, roots, and moist green leaves. Aromas of fresh-turned earth and wild vegetation join lavender and herbs at the heart. Then, as it falls from its crescendo, Allegretto settles on a warm base of cedar wood, vanilla, and benzoin. With its dynamic, seductive pulse, Allegretto is vetiver transcendent.","vetiver, smoke, lavender, mint, herbs, cedar wood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/845000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,melancholy become beautiful listen stirring sombre second movement beethoven's th symphony imagine might smell dark sweeping poignant allegretto study theme variations allegretto built around haitian vetiver brightens darkens develops layering earthy scents smoke lavender allegretto 's notes recede repeat rhythmically fresh mint top note poises air like conductor's baton soon giving way swirls smoke roots moist green leaves aromas fresh turned earth wild vegetation join lavender herbs heart falls crescendo allegretto settles warm base cedar wood vanilla benzoin dynamic seductive pulse allegretto vetiver transcendent,"vetiver, smoke, lavender, mint, herbs, cedar wood, vanilla, benzoin"
Peregrina Extrait de Parfum,Thameen,"Even amongst the most famous precious stones in the world, La Peregrina stands out- a perfectly formed pear-shaped pearl, one of the largest in the world, with a stunning legacy that includes King Philip II of Spain, Napoleon III, and, more recently, Elizabeth Taylor. With a backstory like that, any fragrance to use the name had best be something special. Luckily, Peregrina, the newest from Thameen, is more than up to the challenge- a rich, warm blend of lush florals and spicy resins that exudes royal opulence and Old Hollywood glamour with equal abundance. Like its namesake pearl, Peregrina announces itself already fully formed, eschewing a traditional opening in favor of getting right to the rich, luscious heart of alluring myrrh, mouthwatering vanilla and a seductively sweet ylang ylang supplemented by Damascus rose, gardenia, and jasmine. The base takes the aromatic warmth of the scent to the next level, combining a sweet, resinous amber with smooth white musk. The overall effect is complex and extravagant but disarmingly easy to wear, with a perfectly timeless style- in other words, just as elegant and effortless as a perfect pearl.","rose damascene, lily of the valley, gardenia, jasmin, vanilla, amber, caramel, myrrh, ylang-ylang, white musk, amber, poudre",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/734023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,even amongst famous precious stones world la peregrina stands perfectly formed pear shaped pearl one largest world stunning legacy includes king philip ii spain napoleon iii recently elizabeth taylor backstory like fragrance use name best something special luckily peregrina newest thameen challenge rich warm blend lush florals spicy resins exudes royal opulence old hollywood glamour equal abundance like namesake pearl peregrina announces already fully formed eschewing traditional opening favor getting right rich luscious heart alluring myrrh mouthwatering vanilla seductively sweet ylang ylang supplemented damascus rose gardenia jasmine base takes aromatic warmth scent next level combining sweet resinous amber smooth white musk overall effect complex extravagant disarmingly easy wear perfectly timeless style words elegant effortless perfect pearl,"rose damascene, lily valley, gardenia, jasmin, vanilla, amber, caramel, myrrh, ylang-ylang, white musk, amber, poudre"
Cigar Rum Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"The name - Cigar Rum â is a bit on the nose. But the scent itself? A surprisingly delicate and detailed piece of work that, while definitely redolent of the rich, dried fruit and tobacco leaves soaking in oak caskets of Caribbean island booze implied in the name, has a lightness to it that makes it a fabulously easy wear. We think that part of what makes Cigar Rum such a great candidate for office wear and daytime is that the layers of balsamic woods, tobacco, and dried fruit are dry and crisp, aerated by a salty note that might be the seaweed absolute. The rum is rich and almost chocolatey in its booziness at first, but this fades quite quickly, leaving a cozy, toasted melange of oaky tobacco and dried fruit to linger on the skin. In other words, people will think just that you smell deliciously cozy and 'warm', rather than suspecting you've been drinking. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar and Cigar Rum just smells good.","raisin, dried fruits (prune cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name cigar rum bit nose scent surprisingly delicate detailed piece work definitely redolent rich dried fruit tobacco leaves soaking oak caskets caribbean island booze implied name lightness makes fabulously easy wear think part makes cigar rum great candidate office wear daytime layers balsamic woods tobacco dried fruit dry crisp aerated salty note might seaweed absolute rum rich almost chocolatey booziness first fades quite quickly leaving cozy toasted melange oaky tobacco dried fruit linger skin words people think smell deliciously cozy 'warm' rather suspecting drinking sometimes cigar cigar cigar rum smells good,"raisin, dried fruits (prune cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, seaweed absolute"

Utilizing a subtle yet powerful palette of materials that would have been familiar in the 6th century BCE Mediterranean- warm, sweet resin, woodsy, sappy balsam, and smoky, silver frankincense- Guillaume weaves a tapestry of sophisticated, understated heat that radiates off skin without shouting, all atop a base of crystalline amber and aged, hardened leather. While its design is never meant to overwhelm, the resinous warmth is distinctive and long lasting, making it perfect to cut through the winter cold, yet still subtle enough for summer heat- not to mention an ideal candidate to layer balsamic depth beneath any scent of your choosing.","frankincense, fir balsam, opoponax, benzoin, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34556.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired stone vases leather gourds used transport fragrant resins scented oils ancient corinth peau d'ambre latest reminder pierre guillaume master striking skin scents utilizing subtle yet powerful palette materials would familiar th century bce mediterranean warm sweet resin woodsy sappy balsam smoky silver frankincense guillaume weaves tapestry sophisticated understated heat radiates skin without shouting atop base crystalline amber aged hardened leather design never meant overwhelm resinous warmth distinctive long lasting making perfect cut winter cold yet still subtle enough summer heat mention ideal candidate layer balsamic depth beneath scent choosing,"frankincense, fir balsam, opoponax, benzoin, amber, leather"

20 20 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"Berlin, 1920: the global excess of the Roaring Twenties is in full swing. Artists, authors, and youthful revelers delight in the same glamorous parties, social and gender liberation, and hedonistic exuberance capturing the imaginations of New York, London, and Paris. And in the midst of this paradigm-shattering festivity, there was a singular fragrance- CHIC, from J.F. Schwarzlose & Sehne, a must-have accessory for the fashionable German ""new woman."" 100 years later, as we face a Roaring Twenties of our own, J.F. Schwarzlose has resurrected the spirit of CHIC with 20|20, using detailed analysis of vintage bottles and records to reconstruct and reinvent the historic fragrance as a glamorous and dynamic scent for our own wild times. 2020 is a celebration of craftsmanship and creativity, a romantic tableau where the rich indulgence of pure patchouli meets the cool, velvety freshness of rose essence and bourbon geranium, enveloped in the warmth of sumptuous woody amber notes. The result is vintage floral elegance buoyed by a modern, irreverent buzz of woodsy energy- a fragrance both timeless and contemporary, with an indomitable spirit of creative expression and joie de vivre.

Angelys Pear Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"For Patricia de Nicolai, nature is the ultimate inspiration. And few fragrances are quite as regal, as inspiring, as downright mouthwatering as the pear. Since its introduction to Europe from Asia during Roman times, this uniquely complex fruit has been treasured, considered a ""fruit of the castle"" and a sign of high social distinction. It's this inspiration, specifically as it relates to the Loire Valley of France, where both delicious pears and great castles abound, that serves as the focus of Angelys Pear, named for both the Loire city of Angers, and the lys, the symbolic flower of French kings.
And the scent itself? A divinely sweet and juicy pear note, enhanced by a bouquet of rose and jasmine, highlighted by invigorating oakmoss that suggests a hint of a classical chypre. Ephemeral and serene, full of purity, light, and calm, this eau de toilette perfectly illustrates the fabled bounty of the Loire Valley.","bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313061.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,patricia de nicolai nature ultimate inspiration fragrances quite regal inspiring downright mouthwatering pear since introduction europe asia roman times uniquely complex fruit treasured considered fruit castle sign high social distinction inspiration specifically relates loire valley france delicious pears great castles abound serves focus angelys pear named loire city angers lys symbolic flower french kings scent divinely sweet juicy pear note enhanced bouquet rose jasmine highlighted invigorating oakmoss suggests hint classical chypre ephemeral serene full purity light calm eau de toilette perfectly illustrates fabled bounty loire valley,"bergamot, lemon, cut grass, blackcurrant, pear, jasmine, rose, patchouli, oakmoss, musk"

Brrrrrr... cold. We smell the gin-and-tonic snap of juniper berry, and the cold, rooty gleam of orris. The texture is peppery, silvery, and transparent, like a light mist curling around the trees in a Northern fir forest. There is also a mysterious red berry note weaving in and out â an ice-covered raspberry that adds a dollop of deliciousness.

Hongkong Oolong Eau de Parfum,NEZ,"Hongkong Oolong captures the image of China as I see it in a few years, with its contrasts and modernity. This fragrance juxtaposes my interpretation of tea with the specificity of oolong. Designing a fragrance is always about adapting reality. I thought about what it is in tea that gives pleasure and comfort. So, I built the composition around musky notes, which reveal themselves generously, like the long finish you get with a mature tea. Spicy inflections of cinnamon, cloves, cardamom and ginger reproduce the warming effect of a hearty mouthful. A base of sandalwood and tonka bean round off the accord with a milky sweetness. Then, I incorporated the specific characteristics of oolong and that floral lightness; jasmine, honeysuckle, with its fruity and honeyed accents, and a touch of magnolia, which I associate iwth China. Lastly, hints of leather, incense and moss transform the green, vegetal freshness of the tea leaf to bring out its fermented character.","tea, oolong, musk, spicy, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger, sandalwood, tonka bean, sweet, milky, jasmine, honeysuckle, fruity, honey, magnolia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/770016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hongkong oolong captures image china see years contrasts modernity fragrance juxtaposes interpretation tea specificity oolong designing fragrance always adapting reality thought tea gives pleasure comfort built composition around musky notes reveal generously like long finish get mature tea spicy inflections cinnamon cloves cardamom ginger reproduce warming effect hearty mouthful base sandalwood tonka bean round accord milky sweetness incorporated specific characteristics oolong floral lightness jasmine honeysuckle fruity honeyed accents touch magnolia associate iwth china lastly hints leather incense moss transform green vegetal freshness tea leaf bring fermented character,"tea, oolong, musk, spicy, cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, ginger, sandalwood, tonka bean, sweet, milky, jasmine, honeysuckle, fruity, honey, magnolia"
Salted Green Mango Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Salted Green Mango is utterly unique, and dare we say it, one of Strangers Parfumerie's best. There are green fragrances, there are sour fragrances, there are dry fragrances - Salted Green Mango manages to be all of the above, but with an otherworldly, exotic flair that defies description. Ostensibly an ode to Bao mango, a green, tart mango native to the Southern part of Thailand, where perfumer Prin Lomros was born and raised, there is nothing really sweet or juicy about the fruit note here. Instead, the mango is a thing of rare, desiccated beauty - a dark green rind dipped in sea salt that sucks all the moisture out of your mouth only to think of it.
Why would this be refreshing or appetizing? We don't know, but it just is. Salted Green Mango is a green fruit devoid of sweetness, moisture, or sparkle â instead, it draws us into the shadows of a mineral vetiver and the pleasant bitterness of inedible fruit that is all rind and pith. Salted Green Mango is the crawlspace where we find the coolness and repose we crave in the hottest of weather.","green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,salted green mango utterly unique dare say one strangers parfumerie's best green fragrances sour fragrances dry fragrances salted green mango manages otherworldly exotic flair defies description ostensibly ode bao mango green tart mango native southern part thailand perfumer prin lomros born raised nothing really sweet juicy fruit note instead mango thing rare desiccated beauty dark green rind dipped sea salt sucks moisture mouth think would refreshing appetizing know salted green mango green fruit devoid sweetness moisture sparkle instead draws us shadows mineral vetiver pleasant bitterness inedible fruit rind pith salted green mango crawlspace find coolness repose crave hottest weather,"green mango, bitter orange, petitgrain, lime, bergamot, elemi, pineapple, pomelo, star gooseberry, magnolia, rosa damascena, green chili, sandalwood, guava leaf, vetiver, salt accord, seaweed"
SM Cafe Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"SM Cafe is half cafe, half sado-masochism. An erotic coffee shop, as perfumer Prin Lomros playfully points out. Yes, it does sound rather dirty but ,honestly, SM Cafe is nowhere near as scandalous as it sounds. Put your misgivings to one side, for SM Cafe is simply the glorious coming together of a delicious, aromatic fresh-roasted coffee aroma and a smoky boot leather aroma. Think Aomassae or Coze (Parfumerie Generale) on steroids. We smell two distinct and entrancing accords here, the first, a pure espresso darkness mingling with a sweet and creamy waffle cone note, which conjures up the realistic aroma of a cafe ambiance, and second, the smoky, woody scent of freshly-waxed leather boots. Naughty or just nice? Wear it and decide for yourself. We think it's one of the all-time coffee greats.","coconut flesh, prune absolute, plum, blackcurrant buds absolute, crystallized peach, cinnamon bark oil, ambrette seeds absolute, rose, geranium bourbon, sandalwood oil, oakmoss extract, vetiver java oil, clear woods, vanilla extract, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sm cafe half cafe half sado masochism erotic coffee shop perfumer prin lomros playfully points yes sound rather dirty honestly sm cafe nowhere near scandalous sounds put misgivings one side sm cafe simply glorious coming together delicious aromatic fresh roasted coffee aroma smoky boot leather aroma think aomassae coze parfumerie generale steroids smell two distinct entrancing accords first pure espresso darkness mingling sweet creamy waffle cone note conjures realistic aroma cafe ambiance second smoky woody scent freshly waxed leather boots naughty nice wear decide think one time coffee greats,"coconut flesh, prune absolute, plum, blackcurrant buds absolute, crystallized peach, cinnamon bark oil, ambrette seeds absolute, rose, geranium bourbon, sandalwood oil, oakmoss extract, vetiver java oil, clear woods, vanilla extract, white musk"
Aroon Sawat Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Aroon Sawat, meaning ""good morning!"" in Thai, is part of Strangers Parfumerie's 24/7 series. Inspired by the gentle warmth of the morning sun, the scent was composed by perfumer Prin Lomros with the specific intent of capturing all the golden tones implied in the country's original name of Siam, which is thought to have originated in the word Suvannaphumi, meaning Land of Gold.
And indeed, Aroon Sawat is a perfume rich in warm, ambered notes that seem to shimmer like particles of gold dust caught in sunlight. Thick, syrupy plums, mango, and ripe passionfruit are suspended in multiple layers of hazy woods, ambers, and resins for a smoky incense effect that lingers all day. Think plumes of rich myrrh and sandalwood incense pouring out of an ancient Thai temple and mingling with the heady scent of ripe stone fruits and white flowers in nearby orchards. Yet, in the midst of all these rich, smoky aromas, there is a thread of freshness â from the citrus, or the sour mango â that cuts through the velveteen texture of the scent and allows air to circulate. It's divine. And if you love woody-ambery-leathery scents such as Costume National or Ombre Indigo (or even Chambre Noir) by Olfactive Studio, then Aroon Sawat could scratch the same itch.","golden mango, marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,aroon sawat meaning good morning thai part strangers parfumerie's / series inspired gentle warmth morning sun scent composed perfumer prin lomros specific intent capturing golden tones implied country's original name siam thought originated word suvannaphumi meaning land gold indeed aroon sawat perfume rich warm ambered notes seem shimmer like particles gold dust caught sunlight thick syrupy plums mango ripe passionfruit suspended multiple layers hazy woods ambers resins smoky incense effect lingers day think plumes rich myrrh sandalwood incense pouring ancient thai temple mingling heady scent ripe stone fruits white flowers nearby orchards yet midst rich smoky aromas thread freshness citrus sour mango cuts velveteen texture scent allows air circulate divine love woody ambery leathery scents costume national ombre indigo even chambre noir olfactive studio aroon sawat could scratch itch,"golden mango, marian plum, pomelo, orange flower, bergamot, passion fruit, tuberose, gardenia, incense, myrrh, rose, amber, sandalwood, mandarin"
Burning Ben Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Burning Ben belongs to Prin Lomrosâ LGBTQ series, and was inspired by a subtle moment in the South Korean movie ""Burningâ where the âBenâ character struggles with a conversation that might be interpreted as homophobic, dredging up a host of complex feelings in himself. Burning Ben is a stunning phenolic scent that similarly unites all sorts of opposing elements â hazelnut, beeswax, burning tires, leather, and forest fruit â creating a surprisingly harmonious and âcompleteâ whole, just like the conflicted humanity of Ben.
Burning Ben opens with a hugely realistic shot of espresso, with the dark, roasted flavor of beans brought perhaps a hair too far to burning point. Doused in a black, almost chewy sweet, spicy smoke, it feels like walking through the aftermath of a fire. But fear not, for the smoke clears and lifts in places, revealing intriguing hints of nuts, berries, saffron, and plums, notes that lend the austere smoke a gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness. A caramelized-butter amber, incense, and beeswax tandem shore all of this up from the basenotes, for a complex and rich finish that dawdles pleasurably between sweet, smoky, spicy, and sandalwoody without alighting completely on one or the other. If you love phenolic scents such as The Black Knight by Francesca Bianchi or T-Rex by Zoologist but want something softer and subtler for daytime wear, then Burning Ben could be for you.","hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, javanol, saffron, burning tire",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,burning ben belongs prin lomros lgbtq series inspired subtle moment south korean movie burning ben character struggles conversation might interpreted homophobic dredging host complex feelings burning ben stunning phenolic scent similarly unites sorts opposing elements hazelnut beeswax burning tires leather forest fruit creating surprisingly harmonious complete whole like conflicted humanity ben burning ben opens hugely realistic shot espresso dark roasted flavor beans brought perhaps hair far burning point doused black almost chewy sweet spicy smoke feels like walking aftermath fire fear smoke clears lifts places revealing intriguing hints nuts berries saffron plums notes lend austere smoke gorgeously toothsome gourmand richness caramelized butter amber incense beeswax tandem shore basenotes complex rich finish dawdles pleasurably sweet smoky spicy sandalwoody without alighting completely one love phenolic scents black knight francesca bianchi rex zoologist want something softer subtler daytime wear burning ben could,"hay, plum, espresso, tobacco, hazelnut, leather, patchouli, incense, dark chocolate, tar, castoreum, cognac, labdanum, beeswax, cherry, amber, allspice, javanol, saffron, burning tire"
Cigar Rum Intense Extrait de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"If you loved the original Cigar Rum but longed for more heft, more richness....more everything, then the Extrait version, Cigar Rum Intense, is for you. Sculpting the original's bright, punchy booze-and-tobacco into a new and more mature direction, Cigar Rum Intense leans on a dark, resinous coffee absolute, a dash of cinnamon, and a strong aquatic note to mark itself out as a different animal. Compared to its predecessor, Cigar Rum Intense is altogether a more muscular affair, an injection of briny radiance lifting and hoisting the richly spicy tobacco, booze, and dried fruit accords over the last mile. It lasts forever. Surprisingly, Cigar Rum Intense also smells fresher; a rugged, outdoorsy version of the casual island bar vibe of the original. In the far drydown, a gorgeously silky, masculine-leaning musk emerges, shot thrown by the spicy 'bay rum' bitterness of copaiba, a greenish-gold tree resin native to Brazil. While Cigar Rum is for the young buck, let's say that Cigar Rum Intense is for the man (or woman) who has arrived at the top and isn't afraid to signal it.","raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,loved original cigar rum longed heft richness everything extrait version cigar rum intense sculpting original's bright punchy booze tobacco new mature direction cigar rum intense leans dark resinous coffee absolute dash cinnamon strong aquatic note mark different animal compared predecessor cigar rum intense altogether muscular affair injection briny radiance lifting hoisting richly spicy tobacco booze dried fruit accords last mile lasts forever surprisingly cigar rum intense also smells fresher rugged outdoorsy version casual island bar vibe original far drydown gorgeously silky masculine leaning musk emerges shot thrown spicy 'bay rum' bitterness copaiba greenish gold tree resin native brazil cigar rum young buck let's say cigar rum intense man woman arrived top afraid signal,"raisin, coffee, copaiba, cinnamon, dried fruits (prune cherry), rum absolute, mandarin, amber, tobacco, oakwood, vetiver, resins, labdanum absolute, tea rose, leather, seaweed absolute"
Oliver Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Oliver is an original take on the aromatic herbs and citrus freshness of the traditional eau de cologne. At first, you smell the bright, tart (and always oddly dry) burst of citrus notes of the classic Farina or 4177, with their cleansing and pure aroma designed by nature to awaken and refresh the senses, supported by the crisp, herbal undergrowth of basil leaf, clary sage, and cool, green cypresses. But as the more volatile aromatic notes burn off, you notice some subtly non-traditional notes in the background. There is the musky scent of a man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly from his warm body, introducing a beautifully intimate and human tone (we suspect the glowy magic of ambrette seed and ambergris to be the responsible parties here). Then there is the exciting tang of sea salt, the dry rosy leather of quince, the incensey bitterness of oakmoss, and the powdered plushness of triple-milled French iris soap. Oliver feels personal. It's far more evolved than it ought to be, for all its eau de cologne inspiration. It makes sense to us that this raspy, oddball freshie was inspired by the bittersweet love story of two young men on the cusp between childhood and adulthood in the acclaimed indie movie Call Me by Your Name.","bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oliver original take aromatic herbs citrus freshness traditional eau de cologne first smell bright tart always oddly dry burst citrus notes classic farina cleansing pure aroma designed nature awaken refresh senses supported crisp herbal undergrowth basil leaf clary sage cool green cypresses volatile aromatic notes burn notice subtly non traditional notes background musky scent man's crisp white linen shirt pulled freshly warm body introducing beautifully intimate human tone suspect glowy magic ambrette seed ambergris responsible parties exciting tang sea salt dry rosy leather quince incensey bitterness oakmoss powdered plushness triple milled french iris soap oliver feels personal far evolved ought eau de cologne inspiration makes sense us raspy oddball freshie inspired bittersweet love story two young men cusp childhood adulthood acclaimed indie movie call name,"bitter orange, mojito, grapefruit, bergamot, apricot, quince, petitgrain, mandarin, fig, clary sage, cypress, magnolia, orris concrete, basil, rose de mai, orange flower, pink pepper, coriander, leather, tobacco, ambergris, patchouli, vetiver, ambrette seed, oakmoss, grape leaves, grass, sandalwood, sea salt, linden, mahogany, mastic, olive, clean shirt (blue billowy)"
Lumberjack Cologne Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Lumberjack Cologne smells exactly as advertized a bright, herbal eau de cologne-style scent built around the invigorating scent of freshly-felled lumber! Prin pegs the inspiration for this scent as the scent rising from the dampened shirt of a North American lumberjack after a long morning cutting timber. As he mops his sweaty brow, we lean in and inhale the clean, healthy smell of warm skin, sawdust from the great redwoods he has been touching, and the gasoline smell of his saw and other tools. There is a flash of bitter citrus and Scandinavian herbs in the opening, making us think of the simple but timeless eau de cologne such a man might have applied early on that morning before heading to the forest. Lumberjack Cologne just smells great â a spacious, airy woody scent teeming with the aromatic aroma of tree sap, citrus, herbs, fresh air, clean skin, and cut wood. Nothing more, nothing less. Sometimes it makes sense not to over-think the kind of ripped-from-nature smell that makes us happy. And that is what Lumberjack Cologne is.","lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lumberjack cologne smells exactly advertized bright herbal eau de cologne style scent built around invigorating scent freshly felled lumber prin pegs inspiration scent scent rising dampened shirt north american lumberjack long morning cutting timber mops sweaty brow lean inhale clean healthy smell warm skin sawdust great redwoods touching gasoline smell saw tools flash bitter citrus scandinavian herbs opening making us think simple timeless eau de cologne man might applied early morning heading forest lumberjack cologne smells great spacious airy woody scent teeming aromatic aroma tree sap citrus herbs fresh air clean skin cut wood nothing nothing less sometimes makes sense think kind ripped nature smell makes us happy lumberjack cologne,"lemon, bergamot, grapefruit, mandarin, orris butter, guaiacwood, motor oil, soap, cedar, oak, sycamore, leather, moss"
Sangre Dulce Eau de Parfum,Strangers Parfumerie,"Sangre Dulce is a weird and yet completely wearable gourmand idea born out of Prin Lomrosâ love for two specific movies. The âsangreâ part of the title, meaning blood (or family ties), represents the crazy lifestyle and mores of the strange religious cult in Alejandro Jodorowsky's Santa Sangre, and the âdulceâ part (sweet) comes from the lurid hallucinations experienced by party goers upon ingesting a cocktail laced with LSD in the French movie ""Climax"" by Gaspar NoÃ©.
Based on the inspiration, we expect an oddball mixture of sweet and inedible elements that have been thrown together in a somewhat wild and unconventional manner. And that is exactly what we get! A wild pinprick burst of woodland strawberries, technicolor in their juicy sweetness, imploding over and over again in a beescomb, their pulpy scent muffled by a molten pour of pure gold honey. But there is also a softly musky tobacco-ish accord, shot through with rosewater marshmallow fluff, and buttery ylang sharpened to a spike with blood orange. It is both sweet and not sweet, edible and firmly inedible, all at once. The balance here is superb, refining a cornucopia of fruits, burnt sugar, and balsams to a slim and elegant peak that is unusual in the gourmand genre. Consider us astonished and delighted!","sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang-ylang, benzoin, balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/842008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sangre dulce weird yet completely wearable gourmand idea born prin lomros love two specific movies sangre part title meaning blood family ties represents crazy lifestyle mores strange religious cult alejandro jodorowsky's santa sangre dulce part sweet comes lurid hallucinations experienced party goers upon ingesting cocktail laced lsd french movie climax gaspar based inspiration expect oddball mixture sweet inedible elements thrown together somewhat wild unconventional manner exactly get wild pinprick burst woodland strawberries technicolor juicy sweetness imploding beescomb pulpy scent muffled molten pour pure gold honey also softly musky tobacco ish accord shot rosewater marshmallow fluff buttery ylang sharpened spike blood orange sweet sweet edible firmly inedible balance superb refining cornucopia fruits burnt sugar balsams slim elegant peak unusual gourmand genre consider us astonished delighted,"sangria, rose water, strawberry, brown sugar, honey, cinnamon, tobacco, pomegranate, ylang-ylang, benzoin, balsam, maple syrup, civet, patchouli, blood orange"
Mandarava Extrait de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Inspired by the vision of sweet yellow flowers, white elephants, and towering mountain peaks that make up the Thai vision of Trayastrimsa â the Buddhist Nirvana or Afterlife - Mandarava is perfumer Prin Lomros' interpretation of what heaven smells like. At first, heaven smells like a lei of heady tropical flowers laid around your neck, the lushness of ripe jasmine, rice pudding-esque champaca, and buttery, banana-rich ylang sending the senses reeling. There is an impression of red fruit swollen with juices, threatening to burst out of the pollen-soaked flowers and run down your arm uninterrupted. But this is no innocent, girlish affair. Mandarava shows us that flowers can be downright filthy when they want to be. The lasciviousness of the Hindi oud couples furiously with a sharp civet and earthy cumin to lend the floral bouquet a spicy animalic edge that seems lifted out of 1980s powerhouse canon, before the reformulation bug bit. Now envisage this dense, spicy floral knot being lifted and diffused by a clean, powdery nag champa musk and soft incense ash, wafting in and out of the animalic floral oud notes to breathe air into the composition. After smelling both Ma Nishtana and Mandarava, we are calling Prin Lomros the Master of the Eastern incense theme in perfumery, hands down.","bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, champaca, ylang-ylang, marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, sandalwood, oud, patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired vision sweet yellow flowers white elephants towering mountain peaks make thai vision trayastrimsa buddhist nirvana afterlife mandarava perfumer prin lomros' interpretation heaven smells like first heaven smells like lei heady tropical flowers laid around neck lushness ripe jasmine rice pudding esque champaca buttery banana rich ylang sending senses reeling impression red fruit swollen juices threatening burst pollen soaked flowers run arm uninterrupted innocent girlish affair mandarava shows us flowers downright filthy want lasciviousness hindi oud couples furiously sharp civet earthy cumin lend floral bouquet spicy animalic edge seems lifted powerhouse canon reformulation bug bit envisage dense spicy floral knot lifted diffused clean powdery nag champa musk soft incense ash wafting animalic floral oud notes breathe air composition smelling nishtana mandarava calling prin lomros master eastern incense theme perfumery hands,"bodhi tree, borneol, jasmine sambac, champaca, ylang-ylang, marigold, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, lotus, cinnamon, civet, nagamortha, ruh khus, ebony, sandalwood, oud, patchouli, oakmoss, gardenia, coriander, tolu, benzoin, aldehyde, cumin seed, amber, tuberose, ash"
Ma Nishtana Extrait de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Ma Nishtana are the first two words in a phrase meaning ""Why is tonight different from all other nights?"", taken from the stories and lyrics of Had Gadya (the Chava Alberstein version). In a way, it makes sense to turn this philosophical question on its head and ask, ""why is this incense scent different from all other incense scents?"". After all, incense is a crowded genre and it really takes something special to stand out. Well, Ma Nishtana is something special.
Standing somewhere between the soaring ethereality of Comme des Garcons' Avignon and the spiced, human weirdness of Grimoire by Anatole LeBreton, Ma Nishtana is unusual for its refusal to commit to either coolness or warmth. Instead, it is both, all at once. Its opening of smoky myrrh exploding in a cloud of fizzy aldehydes feels cooling, but immediately a bold dose of saffron, nutmeg, black pepper, cumin, and cardamom, burning through a cloud of ash and smoke turns, up the heat. There is incense â mixed incense resins rather than any single one â smoldering on a near-by censor, creating an aura of 'Buddhist temple'-like mysticism. But there is also the spicy warmth of thickly-fruited tea breads and pain d'epices percolating beneath, filling out the hollows. Austerity balanced by comfort. If you're on an incense quest, then Ma Nishtana might just be your final destination.","saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, norlimbanol, clove, allspice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nishtana first two words phrase meaning tonight different nights taken stories lyrics gadya chava alberstein version way makes sense turn philosophical question head ask incense scent different incense scents incense crowded genre really takes something special stand well nishtana something special standing somewhere soaring ethereality comme des garcons' avignon spiced human weirdness grimoire anatole lebreton nishtana unusual refusal commit either coolness warmth instead opening smoky myrrh exploding cloud fizzy aldehydes feels cooling immediately bold dose saffron nutmeg black pepper cumin cardamom burning cloud ash smoke turns heat incense mixed incense resins rather single one smoldering near censor creating aura 'buddhist temple' like mysticism also spicy warmth thickly fruited tea breads pain d'epices percolating beneath filling hollows austerity balanced comfort incense quest nishtana might final destination,"saffron, amber, aldehyde, frankincense, myrrh, styrax, rose, nutmeg, pink pepper, caraway, black pepper, cardamom, cumin, labdanum, castoreum, sandalwood, patchouli, smoke, leather, norlimbanol, clove, allspice"
Thichila Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Thichila is a stunning floriental incense scent, composed in the Eastern style, that will keep you guessing as to whether it is a floral oud, or an oudy floral, or a luscious floral bouquet awash in exotic Thai herbs and spices. Either way, this scent presents an ever-changing picture, like a landscape of red and gold sands shifting in a sandstorm. The composition of Thichila is a marvel. Although at its core, the scent revolves around a hefty dose of animalic Thai oud dressed up with the minty, camphoraceous freshness of Wan Sao Lhong - a traditional Thai plant that looks like a flower but smells like a herb - Thichila fools us all at first by exploding onto the skin as a bombastic floral. An unctuous combo of champaca flower and Indian tuberose, tangled up in spicy saffron and tangy kaffir lime, creates the phantasm of a jungly ylang ylang. But blink, and before you know it, the floral sweetness is being reined in by a dark and earthy myrrh and roughed up by the leathery funk of that Siam oud. In Thai folklore, Wan Sao Lhong is feted as a love potion. And while Thichila could be a little challenging for oud beginners, one sniff and you will be enchanted â drunk on this Thai love potion.","saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, oud, sandalwood, vetiver, cinnamon bark, wan sao lhong ( amomum biflorum jack)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,thichila stunning floriental incense scent composed eastern style keep guessing whether floral oud oudy floral luscious floral bouquet awash exotic thai herbs spices either way scent presents ever changing picture like landscape red gold sands shifting sandstorm composition thichila marvel although core scent revolves around hefty dose animalic thai oud dressed minty camphoraceous freshness wan sao lhong traditional thai plant looks like flower smells like herb thichila fools us first exploding onto skin bombastic floral unctuous combo champaca flower indian tuberose tangled spicy saffron tangy kaffir lime creates phantasm jungly ylang ylang blink know floral sweetness reined dark earthy myrrh roughed leathery funk siam oud thai folklore wan sao lhong feted love potion thichila could little challenging oud beginners one sniff enchanted drunk thai love potion,"saffron, borneol, kaffir lime, jasmine sambac, champaca, gardenia, tuberose, myrrh, incense, amber, styrax, rose, turmeric, spikenard, nutmeg, civet, oud, sandalwood, vetiver, cinnamon bark, wan sao lhong ( amomum biflorum jack)"
Mohragot Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Mohragot, meaning 'emerald' in Thai, is an aromatic, muscular masculine that draws on the classical European fougere for structure but twists it in a distinctly Eastern direction for a scent that will surprise and delight even the most jaded of palates. Exotic touches such as earthy betel leaf, milky-green-sweet pandan leaf, and dusty, tobacco-ish chalood bark â all materials indigenous to South East Asian countries such as Thailand and India â make it clear that, although we can smell the inky bitterness of oakmoss and the dark green herbal undergrowth of the classic European forest shifting underneath, we are in unfamiliar territory. And it's a thrilling realization.
Thus, in the place of dewy ferns and bright lavender, we smell the damp, reddish soil of the Thai jungle, which mingles with the chewy, green perfumeyness of sweet pandan leaves to create a deeply green, spicy aroma that soothes and excites all at once. In the base, Thai oud joins with a flinty, minty oakmoss and the coumarin-like nuances of chalood bark for a finish that is softly musky and woodsy, gently disengaging the scent from its aromatic topnotes. For those who love the classical fougere genre but wish it were a bit more innovative or exotic, Mohragot should be on your test list.","betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, oud, sandalwood, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/843003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mohragot meaning 'emerald' thai aromatic muscular masculine draws classical european fougere structure twists distinctly eastern direction scent surprise delight even jaded palates exotic touches earthy betel leaf milky green sweet pandan leaf dusty tobacco ish chalood bark materials indigenous south east asian countries thailand india make clear although smell inky bitterness oakmoss dark green herbal undergrowth classic european forest shifting underneath unfamiliar territory thrilling realization thus place dewy ferns bright lavender smell damp reddish soil thai jungle mingles chewy green perfumeyness sweet pandan leaves create deeply green spicy aroma soothes excites base thai oud joins flinty minty oakmoss coumarin like nuances chalood bark finish softly musky woodsy gently disengaging scent aromatic topnotes love classical fougere genre wish bit innovative exotic mohragot test list,"betel leaf, chalood bark, pandan leaf, lime, jasmine sambac, marigold, frangipani, canaga, incense, myrrh, benzoin, clove, rosewood, cinnamon, oud, sandalwood, vetiver, oakmoss"
Tiwa Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Tiwa, Thai for 'daytime', is a radiant floral citrus scent that represents 'the scents of home' for perfumer Prin Lomros, conjuring up the aromatic, fresh scent of local herbs being simmered in a pot by neighbors, nearby citrus orchards, and the lingering smoke of precious woods being dried in sheds. Tiwa belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.
Tiwa is a beautifully fresh, herbal take on the traditional citrus eau de cologne idea. The herbs in the opening are undeniably exotic, with a mouthwateringly savory, minty Thai basil duking it out with sour kaffir lime, spicy finger root oil, and an earthy green celery seed. The bright, tart citrus notes play second fiddle to the herbs for a while, but eventually jostle their way to the front, for an effect that is akin to Diorella or Eau Sauvage covered in verdant Thai foliage. The herbaciousness dies back eventually to reveal a rich, soapy orange blossom freshness that lingers on the skin for hours, like the warmth of a late afternoon sun. Fresh, tart, and rich, Tiwa is an upgrade on the eau de cologne theme that you'd be crazy to miss out on.

Tom Yum Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Oh boy â just say the word Tom Yum and our mouths water. And the perfume Tom Yum has precisely the same effect. Spritz it on and your senses are instantly afire. Inspired by the famously sweet and sour Tom Yum soup of Thailand, Tom Yum (the scent) belongs to Prissana's Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, meaning that it is all natural â more a recipe than a formula, almost. An extra inducement to lick your own skin when you're wearing it.
Tom Yum smells immediately like a steaming hot bowl of Tom Yum. Exploding with bright, citrusy lemongrass and coriander flavors, it is a perfect balance of hot, sweet, sour, and herbal. The flavors seem to go 1,000 leagues deep in each direction. The gingery heat of galangal is cooled by the soapy, lemony grassiness of coriander for a sensory experience that feels invigorating and exciting. Keeping all these explosive herbal and citrus notes in check is a backing of nutty, smoky chalood bark, and a soft sigh's worth of jasmine. Wonderful for a hot summer's day, when a dramatic twist on the traditional eau de cologne-style refreshment is called for.

Natsumeku Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Natsumeku is the Japanese word for the start of the summer and is inspired by the pleasant memory of a day perfumer Prin Lomros spent wandering around the Japanese countryside on a bright, cloudless spring day. Belonging to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, Natsumeku is composed of 100% all-natural raw materials. Natsumeku is pure sunshine in a bottle. Imagine an entire Japanese yuzu tree Ã¢â the variety of citrus native to Japan â pulped, distilled, and poured into a small clear bottle, and that is what it smells like. The traditional woods of Japan â silvery hinoki wood and green, minty-rosy camphor â form the subtle backing to the main players, which are the stunning liquid sunshine of yuzu (both the peel and the fruit), the dark green leaves clustered around the fruit (neroli), and the bittersweet lime twang of bergamot. Being all natural, this joyful explosion of multi-faceted citrus fruits cannot last forever, but the perfumer has cleverly extended the citrus loveliness as far as he can by way of a classically clean, soapy neroli accord that seems to go on forever.

Maruyama Eau de Parfum,Parfum Prissana,"Maruyama, the name of a Japanese mountain, is a scent inspired by a visit made by perfumer Prin Lomros to a herb and flower garden in Sapporo, Hokkaido Japan, an island famous for its incredible diversity of rare medicinal herbs and flowers native to Japan. Using a natural and rare blue chamomile that tints the liquid an unusual blue hue, Maruyama belongs to the Thammachatr (Thai for natural) series, and is thus composed of 100% all-natural raw materials.
Maruyama is a rich, savory-herbal woody scent teeming with the surprising aromas of freshly roast coffee beans, caramelized brown sugar, amber, and celery root â notes that cannot be explained by the notes list. Rather, this is alchemic magic worked by the combination of unusual materials such as lovage root and blue chamomile, herbal notes that have an odd, unexpected richness and dimension to them. Quirky and entrancing, this chorus of 'brown', sweetly aromatic notes proves to be robust, lasting throughout the day until the vegetal muskiness of ambrette seed diffuses it all out into a soft, woodsy haze. If you are fond of rich but kind of weird, offbeat herbal or woody perfumes such as Comme des Garcons' Sequoia, then Maruyama is for you.

If by RK Eau de Parfum,Frapin,"""If you can keep your head when all about you/ Are losing theirs and blaming it on you...""So begins Rudyard Kipling's legendary poem, which, for all the striking and undeniable faults of the author, has endured to become a paean to lives lived with clear eyes and gusto, lives where, to paraphrase Kipling, Triumph and Disaster are two imposters to be treated just the same. Inspired by his grandfather's spirited retelling of the poem, Frapin artistic director David Frossard was traveling south down the Indian coast when he was struck with the desire to create a scent dedicated to travel, adventure, self-discovery, and constant personal improvement. The scent itself is a dashingly spicy masculine that whisks us across the subcontinent with fiery pepper from Karnataka igniting a heady dose of ginger and cinnamon, before balancing it out with a cool, milky fig. At the intersection of spicy and creamy is the main ingredient, precious sandalwood from Mysore, the finest in the world, which finds robust partners in a base of Indonesian patchouli, Peruvian guaiac, and Venezuelan tonka- a rich, smooth, powerful combination for any man ready to seize his destiny. Make no mistake- Kipling himself was not, by any means, a role model. But If by RK transcends the flaws of the man to capture the core of why his words have remained so firmly etched in the public consciousness for all these years.","ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22620.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,keep head you/ losing blaming begins rudyard kipling's legendary poem striking undeniable faults author endured become paean lives lived clear eyes gusto lives paraphrase kipling triumph disaster two imposters treated inspired grandfather's spirited retelling poem frapin artistic director david frossard traveling south indian coast struck desire create scent dedicated travel adventure self discovery constant personal improvement scent dashingly spicy masculine whisks us across subcontinent fiery pepper karnataka igniting heady dose ginger cinnamon balancing cool milky fig intersection spicy creamy main ingredient precious sandalwood mysore finest world finds robust partners base indonesian patchouli peruvian guaiac venezuelan tonka rich smooth powerful combination man ready seize destiny make mistake kipling means role model rk transcends flaws man capture core words remained firmly etched public consciousness years,"ginger, pepper, bergamot, fig milk, cinnamon, cashmere wood, sandalwood, patchouli, guaiac, tonka bean"
Musc Moschus Eau De Parfum,Rania J.,"What makes a perfect winter musk scent? For us, it's a fragrance that can balance the deep, sensual aspects of musk with its fresher, brighter aspects to create something both comforting and stylish- in other words, a scent that wears as well on a bright, clear winter morning as it does in the middle of a blizzard. And Musc Moschus nails this balancing act perfectly- warm yet bright, sweet yet gentle, it's the kind of effortlessly beautiful musk scent that can take the edge off the chilliest day, but won't overwhelm even when you're right next to the fireplace. The secret is the interplay between the strong, lovely base of white musk- at once both smooth and warm- and a strikingly lovely sweet and fruity opening- tart berries and juicy blackcurrant with just the right touch of sugar to feel festive but fresh. Creamy sandalwood and vanilla enhance the richness of the musk, and a perfect touch of iris adds sophistication and depth. It's the perfect scent to carry you through family gatherings and new-year adventures alike. In fact, there's really only one drawback- like winter itself, Musc Moschus is a limited edition that won't be available once 2020 rolls around, so don't miss your opportunity to get a bottle.","bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,makes perfect winter musk scent us fragrance balance deep sensual aspects musk fresher brighter aspects create something comforting stylish words scent wears well bright clear winter morning middle blizzard musc moschus nails balancing act perfectly warm yet bright sweet yet gentle kind effortlessly beautiful musk scent take edge chilliest day overwhelm even right next fireplace secret interplay strong lovely base white musk smooth warm strikingly lovely sweet fruity opening tart berries juicy blackcurrant right touch sugar feel festive fresh creamy sandalwood vanilla enhance richness musk perfect touch iris adds sophistication depth perfect scent carry family gatherings new year adventures alike fact there's really one drawback like winter musc moschus limited edition available rolls around miss opportunity get bottle,"bergamot, strawberry, blackcurrant, sandalwood, iris, vanilla, cashmeran, white musk"
War and Peace II Extrait de Parfum,Areej Le Dore,"War and Peace II is an olfactory battle of life and death, where precious aromatics that are complete opposites clash and then infuse into one another, finding balance and harmony.
In the opening, the composition explodes with a smoky incense represented by Himalayan fossilized amber resin over 35 million years old. This prehistoric substance was dry distilled, allowing it to break and release its ancient spirit. These deep and
dark incensy notes layer with one of the softest aromatics known to man: rose. Leathery, balsamic, slightly piney resin incense lays atop the freshly distilled virgin soul of Indian rose: Ruh Gulab, one of the most precious oils in India. A soft, silky rose cloud, covered in ancient black smoke, a flawless marriage of darkness and light.
Powdery and sticky sweet orris root absolute supports the rose, pulling it into the heart, where aged and soothing, chocolaty patchouli awaits. Warm, sensual orris root absolute in combination with Ruh Gulab conveys the feelings of peace and glory, and brings a burst of life into the composition.
Suddenly, everything that came before is swallowed by the power of nuclear, natural musks. Thick, dark waves of salty ambergris, furry deer musk and dirty black leather of castoreum, co-extracted all together by Russian Adam, create a sensation of loud, struggling, deadly war. Animalics take over, capturing and captivating everything along the way. Wild, ferocious currents of civet take the invasion to an even deeper level. Wafts of smoky amber return to the scene, coupled with one of the most leathery, dirty vetivers, creating a bold, olfactory drama. And when the spectacular aromatic battle has finally mellowed, dry and heavy animalic leather remains to dominate at the base; intense and regal, smooth and sensual, leather that lasts for hours and hours...
Here we have faced a juxtaposition of black and white, of life and death, and through it all, we discover in this calmly aggressive composition a harmonious balance. This olfactory poem, War and Peace, will satisfy even the most adventurous fragrance lover.

Ummo Eau de Parfum,Xinu,"Ummo is a tribute to tobacco, one of the most representative and symbolic plants of the American continent. The smoke given off by the dried leaves of tobacco is considered sacred and has been used for spiritual rituals, healing, and purification ceremonies since long before European commodification made the plant synonymous with indulgence and bad habits. It's this older, purer expression of tobacco that makes Ummo such a uniquely potent and spiritual experience- as rich and spicy as any tobacco scent, but with a gorgeously naturalistic green floral character, enhanced with fresh jasmine tobacco flowers and the sweet resinousness of styrax. A warm but bright tonka and cedar base manages to feel both ethereal and comforting, establishing Ummo as a uniquely soulful tobacco scent, and a welcome addition to Xinu's already impressive lineup.","tobacco, jasmine tobacco, styrax, tonka bean, juniper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/786005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ummo tribute tobacco one representative symbolic plants american continent smoke given dried leaves tobacco considered sacred used spiritual rituals healing purification ceremonies since long european commodification made plant synonymous indulgence bad habits older purer expression tobacco makes ummo uniquely potent spiritual experience rich spicy tobacco scent gorgeously naturalistic green floral character enhanced fresh jasmine tobacco flowers sweet resinousness styrax warm bright tonka cedar base manages feel ethereal comforting establishing ummo uniquely soulful tobacco scent welcome addition xinu's already impressive lineup,"tobacco, jasmine tobacco, styrax, tonka bean, juniper"

Dendera Extrait de Parfum,Centauri Perfumes,"Dendera is inspired by the great ancient Egyptian civilization and the mystery and immense beauty they left behind. The Dendera complex itself is a unique temple, famous for its 'Dendera Lightbulbs' and built upon a much older temple complex newly discovered beneath its floors. The top notes open with rich spices, cinnamon and nutmeg for a warm and inviting beginning. A resinous natural incense accord built upon frankincense and myrrh continues to entice as the scent starts to dry down. The natural Moroccan orris butter has a dry dusty tonality with a gently sweet Rooibos tea like quality. The combination of the orris with the earthy Vietnamese oud is a beautifully dry and rich accord reminiscent of Egyptian desert sands. As it dries down through the resinous incense base a creamy Indian sandalwood comes through, becoming softly coated in a sparkling fine musky white ambergris, a touch of vanilla adds a hint of sweetness.

Gaea Eau de Parfum,Centauri Perfumes,"Gaea, named after Mother Earth, is a harmony of many elements working together as one, just as the many aspects of nature create an overall unity.
The scent starts off amongst a lush forest and opens up with a green leaf accord combined with wormwood that creates a unique and slightly unusual herbal introduction that bringing you right to the edge of the forest. As it starts to progress, the floral notes start to softly emerge. A smooth white tuberose nuanced by rose, lavender and orris starts to come through. A dark honey emerges at the same time coating the florals in a deliciously soft sweetness.
The dry down stays close to the skin like a sensual aura of ambrette musk, ambergris, and honey.

Mile High Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Immortelle flowers don't get their name by accident- these lusciously sweet-smelling members of the Helichrysum family blossom in places lesser florals fear to tread. It's both their intoxicating aroma and their striking fortitude that inspire Mile High, a dynamic, sexy, modern unisex fragrance dedicated to those who thrive no matter what challenges life has to offer. It's only appropriate that the immortelle absolute that animates the heart of Mile High hails from Corsica, an island renowned for its rugged beauty. Sweet and earthy with a hint of spice, it pairs perfectly with a juicy, sharp, gently smoky pineapple note to create a stunning unisex profile that feels fresh, substantial, and undeniably seductive. Combined with the sensual depth of Venezuelan tonka bean and Indonesian patchouli, and we realize that the other connotation of Mile High hasn't been lost on Parle Moi- this is seriously sexy stuff.

Divine Vanille Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"When you have a raw material as glorious as vanilla absolute from Madagascar, the smart thing to do is to let it shine. And in Divine Vanille by perfumer Olivier Pescheux, the costly but sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme âÂ addictively soft and balmy, but with a darkly boozy amaretto tint in the topnotes that will tease your senses and make you want to drink it. A dulcet-toned, nutmeg-spiced tonka bean paste is dabbed on in places to give the vanilla a luscious depth, while a precious osmanthus absolute enhances the naturally leathery aspects of a black, woody vanilla pod. This is all tethered in the dry, slightly bitter smokiness of Texas cedar. But that lush vanilla rings out, as clear as a bell.
This clever but subtle arrangement of notes allows you to enjoy Divine Vanille in several overlapping layers âÂ the delicious warmth of pure vanilla dancing around the fruity suede, which in turn reveals facets of blond tobacco, peach skin, and cinnamon-dusted wood. Wrapped in the powdery, book-paperish resinousness of benzoin and diffusive musks, Divine Vanille is the rare vanilla-centered fragrance that puts the vanilla up front and center without allowing the composition to unravel into the plain white sugar sweetness of a gourmand or letting the other materials drown out its delicate yet singular identity. Divine Vanille is mysterious, yet easy to read - the perfect balance between simple and complex.","clary sage, cinnamon, black pepper, osmanthus, incense, pomarose, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, cedar, musk, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,raw material glorious vanilla absolute madagascar smart thing let shine divine vanille perfumer olivier pescheux costly sustainable vanilla absolute reigns supreme addictively soft balmy darkly boozy amaretto tint topnotes tease senses make want drink dulcet toned nutmeg spiced tonka bean paste dabbed places give vanilla luscious depth precious osmanthus absolute enhances naturally leathery aspects black woody vanilla pod tethered dry slightly bitter smokiness texas cedar lush vanilla rings clear bell clever subtle arrangement notes allows enjoy divine vanille several overlapping layers delicious warmth pure vanilla dancing around fruity suede turn reveals facets blond tobacco peach skin cinnamon dusted wood wrapped powdery book paperish resinousness benzoin diffusive musks divine vanille rare vanilla centered fragrance puts vanilla front center without allowing composition unravel plain white sugar sweetness gourmand letting materials drown delicate yet singular identity divine vanille mysterious yet easy read perfect balance simple complex,"clary sage, cinnamon, black pepper, osmanthus, incense, pomarose, vanilla, tonka, benzoin, cedar, musk, patchouli"
Acqua di Scandola Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Every single molecule in Acqua di Scandola reflects Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's love for Corsica and its wild, windswept beauty. Inspired by the eponymous Scandola, a tiny rocky outcrop of an island just off the Corsican coastline that can only be accessed by the sea, Acqua di Scandola is an unusual aquatic for two reasons. First, it conjures the natural scent of sea air without losing ground to the sweet, melony aromachemicals that ruin other aquatics. Second, Acqua di Scandola encapsulates not only the sea surrounding the island, but also the wild herbs, algae, aromatics, and grasses that cling to the rocks of the island itself. We don't see it listed in the notes, but we smell a lot of citrus in the opening. In fact, it's as if Marc-Antoine Corticchiato borrowed the thrillingly bitter orange note from Azemour Les Orangers or the yuzu from Yuzu Fou, rubbed enough sea salt into its peel to make it crackle, and simply set it into a bed of algae, moss, and lichen. This citrus-in-a-sea-breeze accord is both natural-smelling and durable, occupying most of the scent's trajectory from top to bottom. But in the background, a textured melange of garrigue herbs and grasses adds subtle warmth that reminds us of salt-kissed skin, hay, and minerals evaporating under the sun. Incredibly invigorating and lung-expanding, Acqua di Scandola is the rare aquatic that will really make you feel like you're on or near the sea itself, rather than in a chemical-driven fantasy of the real thing.","algae extract, juniper, immortelle, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,every single molecule acqua di scandola reflects marc antoine corticchiato's love corsica wild windswept beauty inspired eponymous scandola tiny rocky outcrop island corsican coastline accessed sea acqua di scandola unusual aquatic two reasons first conjures natural scent sea air without losing ground sweet melony aromachemicals ruin aquatics second acqua di scandola encapsulates sea surrounding island also wild herbs algae aromatics grasses cling rocks island see listed notes smell lot citrus opening fact marc antoine corticchiato borrowed thrillingly bitter orange note azemour les orangers yuzu yuzu fou rubbed enough sea salt peel make crackle simply set bed algae moss lichen citrus sea breeze accord natural smelling durable occupying scent's trajectory top bottom background textured melange garrigue herbs grasses adds subtle warmth reminds us salt kissed skin hay minerals evaporating sun incredibly invigorating lung expanding acqua di scandola rare aquatic really make feel like near sea rather chemical driven fantasy real thing,"algae extract, juniper, immortelle, moss"
Bee Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"We don't usually play favorites. We love all of our perfumes, and their creators, equally. Trust us, we really do. But when a perfume comes along that's such a unanimous hit with Luckyscent staff, then we feel obliged to mention it. Bee is just irresistible! Opening with a luscious, jellied orange and a smattering of meadow flowers, the honey accord is both extremely realistic and un-animalic â a rare feat that makes Bee a real contender for the title of the baby bear's porridge of the honey fragrance genre. Set deep in a bombastic surround system of glittering amber and incense, the quietly golden floral honey center is magnified and broadcast until it fills the room, creating an incredible sillage that trails after you like the waves made by the Titanic. Though enormously rich and deep, the honey draws upon a doughy beeswax note to muffle its sweetness, and a softly musky, woody base of sandalwood and benzoin to keep it from sliding off into honey's more animalic facets. Honey is such a difficult note to do well â and, in our opinion, Bee is an unmitigated triumph. If you love, the honeyed, ambery warmth of scents such as Botrytis (but could do without the booze and grape must), then this gorgeous scent by Zoologist could be the Bee in your bonnet (sorry).","orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musk, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,usually play favorites love perfumes creators equally trust us really perfume comes along that's unanimous hit luckyscent staff feel obliged mention bee irresistible opening luscious jellied orange smattering meadow flowers honey accord extremely realistic un animalic rare feat makes bee real contender title baby bear's porridge honey fragrance genre set deep bombastic surround system glittering amber incense quietly golden floral honey center magnified broadcast fills room creating incredible sillage trails like waves made titanic though enormously rich deep honey draws upon doughy beeswax note muffle sweetness softly musky woody base sandalwood benzoin keep sliding honey's animalic facets honey difficult note well opinion bee unmitigated triumph love honeyed ambery warmth scents botrytis could without booze grape must gorgeous scent zoologist could bee bonnet sorry,"orange, ginger syrup, royal jelly accord, broom, heliotrope, mimosa, orange flower, benzoin, labdanum, musk, sandalwood, tonka, vanilla"
Majaina Sin Eau de Parfum,The Different Company,"Rich, sweet, and deeply comforting, Majaina Sin proves that The Different Company can do indulgence with every bit as much panache as they famously do freshness. Constructed around a prized specimen of Bourbon Vanilla from Madagascar named Vanilla Gold Extract for its sophisticated and smooth nuance (the product of painstaking hand pollination and careful aging), its intoxicating blend of spicy, sweet, and creamy notes is sure to seduce and delight in equal measure. As a tribute to the unspoiled beauty of Madagascar, Majaina Sin doesn't stop at the vanilla, as the strikingly fiery supporting notes of ginger and cinnamon are also harvested from the island, infusing the smooth, sweet white floral heart with a jolt of passion and energy that balance the mouthwatering sugared orange, chestnut cream, and maple syrup. The result is a scent that truly has something for everyone, an oriental gourmand that won't leave fans of either style wanting. Take a journey to Madagascar with Majaina Sin- we don't blame you if you never want to come back.","candied orange, bigarade, bergamot, neroli, orange blossom, ginger, heliotrope, orchid, chestnut cream, cinnamon, maple syrup, tonka, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25343.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rich sweet deeply comforting majaina sin proves different company indulgence every bit much panache famously freshness constructed around prized specimen bourbon vanilla madagascar named vanilla gold extract sophisticated smooth nuance product painstaking hand pollination careful aging intoxicating blend spicy sweet creamy notes sure seduce delight equal measure tribute unspoiled beauty madagascar majaina sin stop vanilla strikingly fiery supporting notes ginger cinnamon also harvested island infusing smooth sweet white floral heart jolt passion energy balance mouthwatering sugared orange chestnut cream maple syrup result scent truly something everyone oriental gourmand leave fans either style wanting take journey madagascar majaina sin blame never want come back,"candied orange, bigarade, bergamot, neroli, orange blossom, ginger, heliotrope, orchid, chestnut cream, cinnamon, maple syrup, tonka, amber, sandalwood, musk, vanilla"
Mxxx. Extrait de Parfum,ERIS Parfums,"If the âxâ in ERIS Parfumsâ genderfluid fragrance Mx. marked the freedom to be who you want to be, the âtriple xâ of Mxxx. extends that invitation with the lights turned down low â and the animalic growl turned up.
Mxxx. is Extra. Extra animalic. Extra sensual. Extra rich â 20% Extrait concentration. Spicy, smoky, woody, and animalic, Mxxx. has a massive 7% dose of specially tinctured, natural, and ethically sourced Ambergris, and Pierre dâAfrique (Africa Stone or Hyraceum) along with a sumptuous Trinidad Cacao used for the first time ever in a fragrance.
Due to its rarity and cost, fabled Ambergris â the aged and oxidized exudate from a sperm whale â is found largely in synthetic form in most perfumes listing it as an ingredient. At once sweet, earthy, marine, and animalic, natural Ambergris imparts a subtle but unmistakable glow to any elixir it joins, adding an ineffable warmth, coziness, roundness, and sensuality that you have to smell â and feel â to understand.
ERIS partnered with independent haute perfumery lab LâAtelier FranÃ§ais des MatiÃ¨res (âAFDM, â The French Atelier of Materials), benefiting from its expertise in sourcing, novel âgreenâ extraction techniques, and painstaking care in aging and tincturing luxury ingredients such as Ambergris.
Mxxx.âs exclusive Cacao from Trinidad and Tobago, selected by both perfumer Antoine Lie and a French artisanal chocolatier for its dark, spicy character, was processed with its cocoa butter intact. This choice, along with the use of a green, organic solvent and AFDMâs ultrasound technology extraction at a low temperature, results in a Cacao with its full spectrum of aromatic molecules.
Due to its rare ingredients and artisanal production methods, Mxxx. Extrait de Parfum is a limited edition fragrance.","blue ginger, mace co2 extraction, saffron, olibanum, pink peppercorn, cacao, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, benzoin, castoreum, ambergris, pierre d'afrique (hyraceum), green vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/729005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,x eris parfums genderfluid fragrance mx marked freedom want triple x mxxx extends invitation lights turned low animalic growl turned mxxx extra extra animalic extra sensual extra rich extrait concentration spicy smoky woody animalic mxxx massive dose specially tinctured natural ethically sourced ambergris pierre afrique africa stone hyraceum along sumptuous trinidad cacao used first time ever fragrance due rarity cost fabled ambergris aged oxidized exudate sperm whale found largely synthetic form perfumes listing ingredient sweet earthy marine animalic natural ambergris imparts subtle unmistakable glow elixir joins adding ineffable warmth coziness roundness sensuality smell feel understand eris partnered independent haute perfumery lab l atelier fran ais des mati res afdm french atelier materials benefiting expertise sourcing novel green extraction techniques painstaking care aging tincturing luxury ingredients ambergris mxxx exclusive cacao trinidad tobago selected perfumer antoine lie french artisanal chocolatier dark spicy character processed cocoa butter intact choice along use green organic solvent afdm ultrasound technology extraction low temperature results cacao full spectrum aromatic molecules due rare ingredients artisanal production methods mxxx extrait de parfum limited edition fragrance,"blue ginger, mace co2 extraction, saffron, olibanum, pink peppercorn, cacao, cedarwood, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, benzoin, castoreum, ambergris, pierre d'afrique (hyraceum), green vanilla"
Meraki Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"Meraki is a dark homage to one of the most infamous fragrances of all time, Shisedo's long discontinued Nombre Noir. Envisioned as the Japanese brand's breakthrough ""western fragrance"" under the direction of the legendary Serge Lutens, the scent was plagued with cost overruns, packaging complications, and ultimately a run of defective flacons that led to Shisedo pulling the plug and destroying their entire unsold stock. But a few bottles are still out there, and the osmanthus-heavy scent itself, shrouded as it is in speculation and mystery, has been praised by none other than Luca Turin as ""an epiphany"" and ""the perfect discontinued scent.""
When creating Meraki, Rasei Fort certainly wasn't attempting to recreate the scent of Nombre Noir, which he owns but has never dared to open. However, based on the notes, he endeavoured to create a vintage-inspired white floral heavily based around the delicate Osmanthus flower that is somewhat synonymous with the original. It's a tribute to what Nombre Noir represents- the passion and sacrifices made by perfumers and their unrelenting fervour to create fragrances that are individualistic and unique.
And so this is the journey to Meraki, a gorgeous, sumptuous blend of sparkling aldehydes, mouthwatering fruit, and delicately lush, exquisite florals. Equal parts vintage and couture in that inimitable Fort & Manle house style, it's a scent both ravishingly seductive and disarmingly wearable, a creation all its own but with its compelling influences on its sleeve. It's a perfect Rasei Fort creation, in other words. And given its extremely limited availability- only 300 bottles (packaged in exquisite wooden boxes) available worldwide, ever- we think it's a worthy successor to Nombre Noir in every way.","aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78120.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,meraki dark homage one infamous fragrances time shisedo's long discontinued nombre noir envisioned japanese brand's breakthrough western fragrance direction legendary serge lutens scent plagued cost overruns packaging complications ultimately run defective flacons led shisedo pulling plug destroying entire unsold stock bottles still osmanthus heavy scent shrouded speculation mystery praised none luca turin epiphany perfect discontinued scent creating meraki rasei fort certainly attempting recreate scent nombre noir owns never dared open however based notes endeavoured create vintage inspired white floral heavily based around delicate osmanthus flower somewhat synonymous original tribute nombre noir represents passion sacrifices made perfumers unrelenting fervour create fragrances individualistic unique journey meraki gorgeous sumptuous blend sparkling aldehydes mouthwatering fruit delicately lush exquisite florals equal parts vintage couture inimitable fort manle house style scent ravishingly seductive disarmingly wearable creation compelling influences sleeve perfect rasei fort creation words given extremely limited availability bottles packaged exquisite wooden boxes available worldwide ever think worthy successor nombre noir every way,"aldehydes, bergamot, apricot, ambergris, peach, coriander, rose, osmanthus, honey, jasmine, cedarwood, musk, sandalwood, patchouli"
Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is the result of a special collaboration between Ex Nihilo Paris and the French-born visual artist Reine Paradis, who creates narrative photographs and paintings staging herself as the central figure in a transcendent landscape. Reine's work is characterized by abstract swatches of sea blues, greens, and lush tropical colors that plunge the viewer into a semi dream-like state â and this aesthetic has spilled over wholesale into Reine's gorgeous 'edit' of Lust in Paradise.
Thus, if the original Lust in Paradise is a voyage to the French Riviera by way of a blissful dream, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis is a journey to California by way of a Gaugin-esque painting of Tahiti. The original scent's pretty white peony and dewy, fruity lychee gains a new solar dimension by way of the addition of salty, woody ambergris note that creates the impression of sun-warmed skin. Giving the fruit, pink pepper, and pretty florals of the original an expansive, glittering radiance, the ambergris slowly melts down into a sultry woody base that â thanks to the woody-spicy molecule known as Georgywood â adds an even more substantial depth to the original's musky basenotes. Just as pretty and sparkling as the original, Lust in Paradise X Reine Paradis adds a special something that makes us dream of far-off islands, hypnotic seascapes, sun-drenched skin, and the laid-back feel of Californian artist colonies in California.","pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, georgywood, ambergris accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/720057.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lust paradise x reine paradis result special collaboration ex nihilo paris french born visual artist reine paradis creates narrative photographs paintings staging central figure transcendent landscape reine's work characterized abstract swatches sea blues greens lush tropical colors plunge viewer semi dream like state aesthetic spilled wholesale reine's gorgeous 'edit' lust paradise thus original lust paradise voyage french riviera way blissful dream lust paradise x reine paradis journey california way gaugin esque painting tahiti original scent's pretty white peony dewy fruity lychee gains new solar dimension way addition salty woody ambergris note creates impression sun warmed skin giving fruit pink pepper pretty florals original expansive glittering radiance ambergris slowly melts sultry woody base thanks woody spicy molecule known georgywood adds even substantial depth original's musky basenotes pretty sparkling original lust paradise x reine paradis adds special something makes us dream far islands hypnotic seascapes sun drenched skin laid back feel californian artist colonies california,"pink pepper, white peony, lychee, solar accord, white cedarwood, musk, amber, georgywood, ambergris accord"
Copper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"Fiery red metal, yet cool to the touch. The clarity of contrast. The newest from CDG is a provocative olfactive exploration of perceived differences and harmonious alignment built around another everyday material worthy of re-evaluation: copper. In their inimitable, iconoclastic style, the specifics of copper- the shine, the pliability, the literal electricity- are captured with unique notes- luminous pink pepper berries and juicy blackcurrant settle atop intensely green galbanum and sharp violet leaf, fiery ginger and warm, sweet tobacco clash delightfully against a metallic accord, which itself settles in next to warm, resinous myrrh and smooth vanilla. Is this a photo-perfect capture of the actual smell of copper? Why would it be? Rather, this is the soul of copper, cool but conductive, presented for those with the distinctive style to resonate at the same frequency. Another modern masterpiece from Comme des Garcons.","pink pepper, galbanum, blackcurrant, ginger, violet leaf, tobacco, metallic notes, amber, vanilla, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/216001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fiery red metal yet cool touch clarity contrast newest cdg provocative olfactive exploration perceived differences harmonious alignment built around another everyday material worthy evaluation copper inimitable iconoclastic style specifics copper shine pliability literal electricity captured unique notes luminous pink pepper berries juicy blackcurrant settle atop intensely green galbanum sharp violet leaf fiery ginger warm sweet tobacco clash delightfully metallic accord settles next warm resinous myrrh smooth vanilla photo perfect capture actual smell copper would rather soul copper cool conductive presented distinctive style resonate frequency another modern masterpiece comme des garcons,"pink pepper, galbanum, blackcurrant, ginger, violet leaf, tobacco, metallic notes, amber, vanilla, myrrh"

Atlas Fever Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"Inspired by the intoxicatingly woody, incensey scent of the greatest vintage rosewood guitars in history, Atlas Fever combines French niche perfumery know-how with the devil-may-care spirit of rebellion that defines rock n' roll. Its name â a clever twist on the name of its key raw material, Atlas Cedar â is a clue: this scent is not a collection of plain, inert wood but a scent buzzing with a sense of frenetic, barely-contained energy. The opening is fiery and smoldering, a tinder-box cedarwood charged and shot into the air with a burst of hot pink pepper and incense. Incredibly radiant, the oaky tones of the cedar and the smoky-bitter nuances of the gaiac accord billow around the wearer in a thick, spicy brown cloud for a while, before mellowing out into an incredibly lush, creamy surround sound system of real sandalwood, almondy tonka bean, and earthy black vanilla pod. If you love the potently-balsamic, ambery-woody orientals of recent years such as Armani Prive, Myrrhe Imperiale or Guerlain's Songe d'un Bois en Ete, then you'll love Atlas Fever.

Le Pavillon d'Or Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"Le Pavillon DâOr by Parfums Dusita was inspired by three different lakes that bear special meaning for Thai-born perfumer, Pissara Umavijani. First and foremost, it draws on the Sun Moon lake in Taiwan, where her father, the poet Montri Umavijani (1941-2006), wrote âA Wishâ, a poem that reads: âWill I ever have a chance/to sleep by the River of Love/look on the mountain of Long Life/and dip my vision in Sun Moon Lake/to be able to live more happily/in just any confinementâ. But Pissara was also inspired by her love for GuerlÃ©dan Lake in Brittany, a place where she has vacationed in utter tranquility and quiet, as well as the Aisawan Triphya-Art pavilion in Thailand, a stupendous piece of Thai architecture that seems to float weightlessly several feet over the waters of the palace lake. Regardless of geography, however, it is the sense of calm, emotive beauty common to all lakes that pervades the bones of Le Pavillon dâOr.","mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,le pavillon parfums dusita inspired three different lakes bear special meaning thai born perfumer pissara umavijani first foremost draws sun moon lake taiwan father poet montri umavijani wrote wish poem reads ever chance/to sleep river love/look mountain long life/and dip vision sun moon lake/to able live happily/in confinement pissara also inspired love guerl dan lake brittany place vacationed utter tranquility quiet well aisawan triphya art pavilion thailand stupendous piece thai architecture seems float weightlessly several feet waters palace lake regardless geography however sense calm emotive beauty common lakes pervades bones le pavillon,"mint, honeysuckle, orris, boronia, thyme, olibanum, heliotrope, fig leaf, oak, sandalwood"
Les Annees 25 Bis Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"Les Annees 25 Bis is an exuberant throwback to what Andy Tauer refers to as the golden age of perfumery- 1920's Europe. During the so-called ""Anees Folles"", jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined the modern woman, and Art Deco peaked- and every bit of that stylish, sexy, iconoclastic energy is captured in Les Annees 25 Bis, a fragrance in grand style, uncompromisingly vintage chic, and yet alluringly modern.
Les Annees 25 Bis opens with a fresh citrus and fruit blast, combining the blinding brightness of bergamot and lemon with a mouthwatering peach accord and the intoxicating syrupiness of sweet orange oil. A glamorous heart finds lush natural rose absolute and ylang-ylang essential oil meeting a vibrant iris root, whose earthy depth steers the scent back into unisex territory. It also prepares the ground for a complex, luxurious base- benzoin, patchouli, sandalwood, ambergris, musks, and vanilla which melt together into a rich, exquisite, and long-lasting skin scent that boasts a vintage purr but a modern panache.","bergamot, lemon, orange, peach, rose, iris, ylang-ylang, benzoin, vetiver, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31470.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,les annees bis exuberant throwback andy tauer refers golden age perfumery 's europe called anees folles jazz music blossomed flapper redefined modern woman art deco peaked every bit stylish sexy iconoclastic energy captured les annees bis fragrance grand style uncompromisingly vintage chic yet alluringly modern les annees bis opens fresh citrus fruit blast combining blinding brightness bergamot lemon mouthwatering peach accord intoxicating syrupiness sweet orange oil glamorous heart finds lush natural rose absolute ylang ylang essential oil meeting vibrant iris root whose earthy depth steers scent back unisex territory also prepares ground complex luxurious base benzoin patchouli sandalwood ambergris musks vanilla melt together rich exquisite long lasting skin scent boasts vintage purr modern panache,"bergamot, lemon, orange, peach, rose, iris, ylang-ylang, benzoin, vetiver, patchouli, ambergris"

In other words, past and future have an olfactory dialogue on the velvet seats of the Parisian landmark in the tradition of Comme des Garcons anti-perfumes. The results are subtle and affecting- the energetic hum of black pepper and coffee like an orchestra tuning up, the smooth ambrette and orange blossom the buzz of the crowd, rich orris and sharp rose oxide the warm stage lights, and a deep and gently woodsy base the long lasting final applause.

Corpse Reviver Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"In 2016, Bruno Fazzolari and Bogue's Antonio Gardoni released Cadavre Exquis, a playful and exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents through a sort of olfactory game of telephone. Featuring a striking dark chocolate note atop vintage-feeling aromatic florals, boozy fruit, and a potent dose of animalics, it was a monster of a scent- one that challenged- and rewarded- those off-kilter enough to get on its level. Now, with Corpse Reviver, Bruno Fazzolari has brought the spirit of Cadavre Exquis back to the mortal plane, but with a bit of rebalancing meant to let the disparate elements play nice together. And we must confess, it works perfectly- now, the rich, earthy indulgence of the dark chocolate springs more naturally from the juicy, boozy opening, while the animalics and spicy florals recede slightly in favor of the aromatics, allowing the composition to breathe and evolve. In the mood for a wholly unique, sophisticated gourmand with real artistic flair? Don't miss Corpse Reviver.","blood orange, camphor, whiskey, rosemary, marigold, dried fruit, anise, cypress, dark chocolate, vanilla, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69316.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bruno fazzolari bogue's antonio gardoni released cadavre exquis playful exuberant kinda gourmand scent created across two continents sort olfactory game telephone featuring striking dark chocolate note atop vintage feeling aromatic florals boozy fruit potent dose animalics monster scent one challenged rewarded kilter enough get level corpse reviver bruno fazzolari brought spirit cadavre exquis back mortal plane bit rebalancing meant let disparate elements play nice together must confess works perfectly rich earthy indulgence dark chocolate springs naturally juicy boozy opening animalics spicy florals recede slightly favor aromatics allowing composition breathe evolve mood wholly unique sophisticated gourmand real artistic flair miss corpse reviver,"blood orange, camphor, whiskey, rosemary, marigold, dried fruit, anise, cypress, dark chocolate, vanilla, civet"
Elysium Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums,"Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is the original Elysium extrait in a linen summer suit, an eau de cologne-soaked kerchief tucked into the shirt pocket. Forming part of Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne - Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is pure summer bliss in a bottle, bathing the wearer in a cloud of sparkling, sun-lit citrus and vetiver that lasts all day long. The original's topsy-turvy structure of balmy musks followed by fresh fruit has been inverted here; in the Parfum Cologne iteration, the joyful opening volley of grapefruit, bergamot, and lime is followed by a scintillating vetiver that sparkles as brightly as the citrus fruits. Joined by the aromatic gin-and-tonic notes of juniper berry and lemon peel, this smells like the first (and best) sip of a cold drink on a wearyingly hot day. The fruitiness of the apple and blackcurrant heart notes is toned down slightly in the Cologne concentration, relying on a slightly drier combination of citrusy vetiver and airy musks to keep the scent buoyant. Towards the end, a balmy but decidedly light creaminess creeps in, the happy result of benzoin and vanilla mingling with the airy cloud of musks and ambergris - yet Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne never loses its crisp zestiness. This Parfum Cologne edition is emphatically its own creature while retaining all the smooth luxuriousness that made the original extrait so special. If you'd like Aventus without the smoky pineapple or a more polished, rounder Bleu de Chanel, then step into the glorious Elysian Fields that is the Elysium Pour Homme Parfum Cologne experience.","lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,elysium pour homme parfum cologne original elysium extrait linen summer suit eau de cologne soaked kerchief tucked shirt pocket forming part roja dove's parfum cologne collection new category invented roja dove give clients luxuriousness edp concentration freshness eau de cologne elysium pour homme parfum cologne pure summer bliss bottle bathing wearer cloud sparkling sun lit citrus vetiver lasts day long original's topsy turvy structure balmy musks followed fresh fruit inverted parfum cologne iteration joyful opening volley grapefruit bergamot lime followed scintillating vetiver sparkles brightly citrus fruits joined aromatic gin tonic notes juniper berry lemon peel smells like first best sip cold drink wearyingly hot day fruitiness apple blackcurrant heart notes toned slightly cologne concentration relying slightly drier combination citrusy vetiver airy musks keep scent buoyant towards end balmy decidedly light creaminess creeps happy result benzoin vanilla mingling airy cloud musks ambergris yet elysium pour homme parfum cologne never loses crisp zestiness parfum cologne edition emphatically creature retaining smooth luxuriousness made original extrait special like aventus without smoky pineapple polished rounder bleu de chanel step glorious elysian fields elysium pour homme parfum cologne experience,"lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum"
Creation-E Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums,"Roja's much loved Creation-E, or Enigma as it's known over the pond, is probably the ne-plus-ultra of private men's club genre - a heady swirl of cognac, rum, cane sugar, cigar tobacco, vanilla, and gingery aromas that wraps around its wearer like an ermine cloak custom-made in one of London's Saville Row tailors. But maybe â just maybe â you can't wear an ermine cloak of a scent every day (though Roja would probably argue with us on that one). If you love the rich warmth of this spicy oriental and just don't know how to quit it, then take heart â Roja Dove has heard you. Creation-E Parfum Cologne is a much lighter, fresher take on the original eau de parfum that's perfect for both those early office meetings and stupid hot weather. The warm booziness of cognac and rum is still there, but cast over a frame that features lighter, fresher qualities of woods, tobacco, and jasmine, you get less of that 'rum-and-coke' feel that's not really appropriate outside of date night or deep winter, and more of a lightly-spiced, powdered tobacco affair. You still get all the complexity of the jasmine layered with woods, spice, leather, and woods, but Creation-E Parfum Cologne is an airy genoise to the fruitcake of the original. Both iterations are gorgeous, so choose according to your own lifestyle and personality!","bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,roja's much loved creation e enigma known pond probably ne plus ultra private men's club genre heady swirl cognac rum cane sugar cigar tobacco vanilla gingery aromas wraps around wearer like ermine cloak custom made one london's saville row tailors maybe maybe can't wear ermine cloak scent every day though roja would probably argue us one love rich warmth spicy oriental know quit take heart roja dove heard creation e parfum cologne much lighter fresher take original eau de parfum that's perfect early office meetings stupid hot weather warm booziness cognac rum still cast frame features lighter fresher qualities woods tobacco jasmine get less 'rum coke' feel that's really appropriate outside date night deep winter lightly spiced powdered tobacco affair still get complexity jasmine layered woods spice leather woods creation e parfum cologne airy genoise fruitcake original iterations gorgeous choose according lifestyle personality,"bergamot, geranium, rose de mai, neroli, jasmin de grasse, heliotrope, cardamom, ginger, pepper, patchouli, cognac, tobacco, sandalwood, benzoin, vanilla, ambergris"
Danger Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums,"A super-complex, aromatic barbershop fougere with a classically masculine ballast of cedarwood, patchouli, and oakmoss in the background for support, Danger Pour Homme eau de parfum is now translated into a lighter, fresher form via Roja Dove's ""Parfum Cologne"" collection - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne is as deeply aromatic and savory-herbal-soapy as its predecessor, but to our noses, the new Parfum Cologne iteration replaces much of the eau de parfum's earthy moss and patchouli basenotes with a beautifully hazy, diffuse cedarwood blown out into a radiant cloud of ambergris and musk. This alteration turns the classic, mature tailoring of the eau de parfum into something altogether younger and more sensual. Certainly, we find the combination of the tart aromatics â lavender, tarragon, and bergamot â and the creamy musks, tonka bean, and cedarwood to be surprisingly sexy. Danger Pour Homme Parfum Cologne retains the impeccable bone structure of the original but loosens the knot of its tie to expose an inviting glimpse of warm, tanned flesh.","lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily of the valley, jasmin de grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748054.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,super complex aromatic barbershop fougere classically masculine ballast cedarwood patchouli oakmoss background support danger pour homme eau de parfum translated lighter fresher form via roja dove's parfum cologne collection new category invented roja dove give clients luxuriousness edp concentration freshness eau de cologne danger pour homme parfum cologne deeply aromatic savory herbal soapy predecessor noses new parfum cologne iteration replaces much eau de parfum's earthy moss patchouli basenotes beautifully hazy diffuse cedarwood blown radiant cloud ambergris musk alteration turns classic mature tailoring eau de parfum something altogether younger sensual certainly find combination tart aromatics lavender tarragon bergamot creamy musks tonka bean cedarwood surprisingly sexy danger pour homme parfum cologne retains impeccable bone structure original loosens knot tie expose inviting glimpse warm tanned flesh,"lemon, bergamot, lavender, tarragon, lily valley, jasmin de grasse, violet, rhubarb, galbanum, clove, cumin, patchouli, oakmoss, wood notes, vetiver, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean, leather, ambergris, musk"
Scandal Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums,"If the original Scandal pour Homme eau de parfum is an aromatic fougere on steroids (think Eau Sauvage to the nth degree), then the Parfum Cologne version is a lighter, more relaxed take. Through still incredibly masculine and classic-smelling, the additional space and air introduced into the structure allows us to smell all of the aromatic notes more clearly and separately, the spearmint smells freshly-plucked, the stalky rhubarb note more distinct, and the petitgrain even more searingly bitter. The original extrait's coumarin-rich finish has been lightened in the Parfum Cologne iteration so that the herbal tarragon and moss notes get to sing out their forest-green song for much longer, and we notice that the drydown is also fresher, with the sweeter tonka and labdanum notes dialed back in favor of the salty ambergris and radiant musks.

Vetiver Parfum Cologne,Roja Parfums,"With its new iteration as a Parfum Cologne - a new category invented by Roja Dove to give clients the luxuriousness of an EDP concentration (between 15% and 20%) but with the freshness of an eau de cologne Roja once again proves that there's nothing on the market today that comes close to the sheer purity and quality of his Vetiver par excellence. Indeed, we're rather relieved to report that this iteration of Vetiver is very close in character to the genre-defining eau de parfum, especially in its focus on the bright, sparkling qualities of vetiver over its oft-times danker, rootier aspects. But Vetiver Parfum Cologne is indubitably lighter and fresher in feel. Its exquisite balance of woods, citrus, and grassy-nutty vetiver is borne aloft on a raft of expansively radiant musks and cedarwood and its lemongrass-y litsea cubeba is even more foot-forward than in the eau de parfum. Let's call it the summer-weight twin of the original, with a slightly cooler tone overall. Choose according to preference in weight, warmth, and density. Or maybe don't choose at all - get both and have your vetiver needs covered in one neat (and impossibly elegant) package! In other words, worry not. What we love the most about Roja's vetiver â its brightness, its smooth-as-silk texture, its wholesome nuttiness, and its lack of discordant bitterness or dankness has been transposed wholesale here into the Parfum Cologne.","lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/748056.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,new iteration parfum cologne new category invented roja dove give clients luxuriousness edp concentration freshness eau de cologne roja proves there's nothing market today comes close sheer purity quality vetiver par excellence indeed we're rather relieved report iteration vetiver close character genre defining eau de parfum especially focus bright sparkling qualities vetiver oft times danker rootier aspects vetiver parfum cologne indubitably lighter fresher feel exquisite balance woods citrus grassy nutty vetiver borne aloft raft expansively radiant musks cedarwood lemongrass litsea cubeba even foot forward eau de parfum let's call summer weight twin original slightly cooler tone overall choose according preference weight warmth density maybe choose get vetiver needs covered one neat impossibly elegant package words worry love roja's vetiver brightness smooth silk texture wholesome nuttiness lack discordant bitterness dankness transposed wholesale parfum cologne,"lemon, bergamot, litsea cubeba, rose de mai, jasmin de grasse, cistus, galbanum, celery seed, pink pepper, caraway, nutmeg, pepper, oakmoss, vetiver, cedarwood, cedar needles, guaiac wood, amyris, labdanum"
La Capitale Parfum,Xerjoff,"Refined and robust, La Capitale is a testament to Moscow in all of its glorious contradictions- the grandeur and grime, the charm and the chaos, the history and hipness- a true international metropolis. Any fragrance to do justice to this fascinating city must, of course, be as larger than life as the city itself, and so La Capitale bursts forth from the skin, a fruity, spicy, luscious, indulgent fragrance full of joy, zest, and the indomitable Russian spirit. On first spray, La Capitale is an explosively fruity, mouthwateringly sweet affair- caramel-dipped strawberries drip with sugared indulgence, while a juicy peach adds quenching refreshment. The heart of the fragrance ushers in a sophisticated and luxurious floral leather, reinforced with resinous labdanum, lush rose, and a beguilingly spicy blend of saffron and ginger. It all rests atop a wonderfully Xerjoff base of benzoin, amber, and vanilla, smooth, rich, and delectable. Powerful, complex, and undeniably compelling, La Capitale is a fitting tribute to the glorious sophistication of Moscow.","strawberry, caramel, peach, labdanum, leather, saffron, ginger, rose, amber, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,refined robust la capitale testament moscow glorious contradictions grandeur grime charm chaos history hipness true international metropolis fragrance justice fascinating city must course larger life city la capitale bursts forth skin fruity spicy luscious indulgent fragrance full joy zest indomitable russian spirit first spray la capitale explosively fruity mouthwateringly sweet affair caramel dipped strawberries drip sugared indulgence juicy peach adds quenching refreshment heart fragrance ushers sophisticated luxurious floral leather reinforced resinous labdanum lush rose beguilingly spicy blend saffron ginger rests atop wonderfully xerjoff base benzoin amber vanilla smooth rich delectable powerful complex undeniably compelling la capitale fitting tribute glorious sophistication moscow,"strawberry, caramel, peach, labdanum, leather, saffron, ginger, rose, amber, benzoin, vanilla"
SpeM PetraM Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"""Spem Petram, "" which translates to ""Stone of Hope, "" is a deeply personal fragrance for Olivier Durbano, one that finds his religious, spiritual, and artistic impulses overlapping to create a deeply resonant, biblically-inspired (the capital M's are a nod to Mary Magdalene, who in French religious lore lived out her life in the forests of Southern France) scent of dark wood, spicy resin, and incense. At its core is a unique ingredient oft-referenced in the good book- nard, an aromatic central Asian plant related to valerian root with a distinctively earthy, salty, mineralic quality. It's the perfect bridge between the other ingredients- smoky olibanum, fiery cinnamon and saffron, sharp, bright fir, and rich woods, everything combining to build to an ecstatic crescendo tempered with an unexpectedly lush rose note. Together, it creates a powerful sense of exotic spirituality- potent, warm, and soothing, but with an otherworldly characteristic that never becomes overly familiar.","olibanum, cinnamon, bay leaf, saffron, fir balsam, cabreuva, rose, nard, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36917.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,spem petram translates stone hope deeply personal fragrance olivier durbano one finds religious spiritual artistic impulses overlapping create deeply resonant biblically inspired capital m's nod mary magdalene french religious lore lived life forests southern france scent dark wood spicy resin incense core unique ingredient oft referenced good book nard aromatic central asian plant related valerian root distinctively earthy salty mineralic quality perfect bridge ingredients smoky olibanum fiery cinnamon saffron sharp bright fir rich woods everything combining build ecstatic crescendo tempered unexpectedly lush rose note together creates powerful sense exotic spirituality potent warm soothing otherworldly characteristic never becomes overly familiar,"olibanum, cinnamon, bay leaf, saffron, fir balsam, cabreuva, rose, nard, musk, cedar"
Oud Maximus Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"What is real exoticism? This is something that you just couldn't try before. Today many people know what Oud is. But only a few know how rich and unusual can be the character of the wild Oud, fully revealed in a masterfully created blend. In Oud Maximus the concentration of Oud oils is so high that to preserve other notes, a special technique was created for mixing the Laotian, Indian and Thai Oud with four Rose oils from India, the Himalayas, Indonesia and France. The start of the fragrance is focused on the tantalizing animalistic character of the Oud from Laos, supported by Jasmine and Citruses. A voluminous accord of ambery Roses and Magnolia blossoms in the heart. The base consists of miscellaneous Oud oils, Civet and the Musk of Kabarga, which give the composition roundness and softness. This is how the precious fragrance maximally opening the heart of the wild Oud is born. No wonder, Oud Maximus is dedicated to the perfumer's son Maxim.

Vetiver Nocturne Autumn 19 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"If you think that you 100% aware of how vetiver can and should smell, you're probably wrong. This note requires a special attitude and deserves a dignified framing. Only under such conditions a vetiver composition of timeless beauty can be born. This is especially true when it comes to the precious Indian 25-year-old vetiver oil Ruh Khus, which forms the heart of Vetiver Nocturne. In order to make the start of the fragrance greener, a young Ruh Khus is used: in its distillation process it passes through the copper pipes and thus acquires green color and smell. The base of the composition consists of the oils of Indonesian Sandalwood and Oud Trat, which were distilled by the perfumer himself with the use of a special infusion technique: during the distillation process wooded materials were enriched by the oils of White Champaca and Thai Jasmine. Floral notes revealed the beauty of Sandalwood oil extracted from the roots of centuries-old Sandalwood trees, which were cut down a long time ago and nowadays only their roots, which were preserved in the ground for years, are available to give us an aromatic material of the highest quality. Only the real Mysore Sandalwood, which is also generously used in the composition, can compete with it in terms of rarity and resplendence. It's hard to imagine a better framing for the Vetiver note than this.

Female Christ Eau de Parfum,19-69,"On 29 May 1969, a naked woman carrying a cross walked through the Copenhagen Stock Exchange- an iconic piece of performance art carried out by Danish artists Lene Adler Petersen and Bjorn Norgaard that gripped the culture with its transgressive nature and exploration of religion, eroticism, and capitalism. However, as with so much of the genre-defying protest art of the '60s, only a photograph remains to commemorate the accomplishment. By introducing Female Christ the fragrance, a powerful, thoughtful, and deeply sensual blend of patchouli and resin, 19-69 preserves the essence of the art piece for the next generation to discover and learn. Female Christ is, first and foremost, a patchouli scent- rich, earthy, velvety, warm. Invigorating currents of spicy and herbaceous aromatics- eucalyptus, thyme, pimento- keep a bright liveliness in the foreground, while juicy rhubarb and berries add a sweet, fresh balance to the earthiness. As it dries, a sexy, provocative benzoin combines with dashes of vanilla and ambergris to transport the ever-present patchouli from the '60s milieu into something more transcendently contemporary, asserting the lasting significance of the piece that inspired the scent. 19-69 have already proven themselves masters of stylish, provocative patchouli scents- with Female Christ, they have raised the bar yet again.","eucalyptus, patchouli, pimento, rhubarb, thyme, geranium, berries, vanilla, ambergris, benzoin, cinnamon, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,may naked woman carrying cross walked copenhagen stock exchange iconic piece performance art carried danish artists lene adler petersen bjorn norgaard gripped culture transgressive nature exploration religion eroticism capitalism however much genre defying protest art ' photograph remains commemorate accomplishment introducing female christ fragrance powerful thoughtful deeply sensual blend patchouli resin preserves essence art piece next generation discover learn female christ first foremost patchouli scent rich earthy velvety warm invigorating currents spicy herbaceous aromatics eucalyptus thyme pimento keep bright liveliness foreground juicy rhubarb berries add sweet fresh balance earthiness dries sexy provocative benzoin combines dashes vanilla ambergris transport ever present patchouli ' milieu something transcendently contemporary asserting lasting significance piece inspired scent already proven masters stylish provocative patchouli scents female christ raised bar yet,"eucalyptus, patchouli, pimento, rhubarb, thyme, geranium, berries, vanilla, ambergris, benzoin, cinnamon, cashmere wood"

Atomic Rose, their newest release, is another prime example of Initio's ability to find the harmonic balance between beauty and potency- a ravishingly sexy, invigoratingly unisex rose scent with liveliness and style to spare. Built around a ravishing duo of lush, top-quality Turkish and Bulgarian roses, Atomic Rose showcases every facet of its titular ingredient with carefully chosen supplemental notes- a juicy pop of bergamot, a spicy buzz of pink pepper, and a sumptuous blend of real florals (authentic Egyptian jasmine) and seductive floral derivatives (a potent dose of hedione) to seriously ramp up the power and sensuality. A long-lasting base of sweet, musky vanilla only deepens the effect, wrapping everything in a swoon-worthy haze. So no, Atomic Rose isn't the most naturalistic soliflore or softly-spoken feminine rose you've ever smelled- it's not meant to be.

Mizunara Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"A fragrance inspired by the distinct character of Japanese oak and beech trees spread over a rippling lake deep in the woods, Mizunara is an intriguingly complex combination of aquatic herbal notes and smoky woods that transport you to a hauntingly lovely and ancient forest tableau. At first spray, bright green galbanum fills the senses, like a fresh wind passing across the lake surface, carrying with it the scent of lily pads and pond algae, mixing with the invigorating wild herbs that grow on the ground below- rosemary and clary sage. A sharp lavender sparkles like the light reflecting onto the nearby beech leaves. As the distinctively Japanese wood notes emerge in strength- sharp and stout, with smoky tones- the second meaning of this fragrance emerges. Japanese wood, after all, makes up the barrels that give aged Japanese whiskey their distinctive flavor, and the wood here is cut with sweet, dry cognac oil to evoke the slightest hint of boozy malt beneath the patchouli and resins of Mizunara's base notes. The cumulative effect is one that should please liquor drinkers and nature enthusiasts alike- a fresh, bright, powerful woods scent, replete with uniquely Japanese character, deep and sophisticated enough for lovers of complex niche, but not without its easy-to-wear charm. In other words, a true fragrant journey the quality of which we've come to expect from the always exceptional Parfum Satori.","galbanum, rosemary, clary sage, lavender, cognac oil, juniper, cypress, patchouli, blue chamomile, labdanum, tulu balsam, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/768005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance inspired distinct character japanese oak beech trees spread rippling lake deep woods mizunara intriguingly complex combination aquatic herbal notes smoky woods transport hauntingly lovely ancient forest tableau first spray bright green galbanum fills senses like fresh wind passing across lake surface carrying scent lily pads pond algae mixing invigorating wild herbs grow ground rosemary clary sage sharp lavender sparkles like light reflecting onto nearby beech leaves distinctively japanese wood notes emerge strength sharp stout smoky tones second meaning fragrance emerges japanese wood makes barrels give aged japanese whiskey distinctive flavor wood cut sweet dry cognac oil evoke slightest hint boozy malt beneath patchouli resins mizunara's base notes cumulative effect one please liquor drinkers nature enthusiasts alike fresh bright powerful woods scent replete uniquely japanese character deep sophisticated enough lovers complex niche without easy wear charm words true fragrant journey quality we've come expect always exceptional parfum satori,"galbanum, rosemary, clary sage, lavender, cognac oil, juniper, cypress, patchouli, blue chamomile, labdanum, tulu balsam, sandalwood"
Fall Into Stars Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC,"Fall Into Stars is a meditation on the universe itself: dark, mysterious, yet leaving a trail of powerful illuminations. The scent contains a core of pure oud, which gives fallintostars a deep, primal quality, emphasized with amber and labdanum notes. It's complemented by ingredients like pink peppercorn and rosewood, which make the scent dreamlike and ethereal.
The stardust and pollen effect come from natural and wild French daffodil; a golden amber effect comes from a Fairwild certified Peru Balsam and a Siam Benzoin resin, which cast light from the back of the scent; and an illuminating solar effect comes from fresh ginger, bergamot and saffron. That ensemble is nested in a combination of ouds, For Life-certified roses, and henna flower.","daffodil, pink pepper, ginger, bergamot, saffron, rose, henna, oud, rosewood balsam, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fall stars meditation universe dark mysterious yet leaving trail powerful illuminations scent contains core pure oud gives fallintostars deep primal quality emphasized amber labdanum notes complemented ingredients like pink peppercorn rosewood make scent dreamlike ethereal stardust pollen effect come natural wild french daffodil golden amber effect comes fairwild certified peru balsam siam benzoin resin cast light back scent illuminating solar effect comes fresh ginger bergamot saffron ensemble nested combination ouds life certified roses henna flower,"daffodil, pink pepper, ginger, bergamot, saffron, rose, henna, oud, rosewood balsam, benzoin"
Chypre-Siam Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Chypre-Siam is a joyful middle finger to IFRA. Unrepentedly teeming with enough oakmoss to make an EU official faint, this is a fragrance that lays lie to the notion that they 'just don't make 'em like they used to anymore.' With Chypre-Siam, Manuel Cross proves for once and for all that it's not only possible make an authentic chypre in this day and age, but that it's possible to do it so well that it sounds like a battle cry. But if all Cross were to do is mix oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin together, it would be dull and derivative. Instead, Chypre-Siam has been designed as an irreverent 'South East Asian' take on the classic chypre, with a tart kaffir lime topnote replacing the traditional bergamot, and Thai holy basil to underline the minty bitterness of that oakmoss underpinning. Its raunchy, civet-inflected leather accord lends a lascivious purr that feels like labdanum ramped up beyond its normal range. And yet, despite the heavy-sounding notes, Chypre-Siam retains a fresh, translucent greenness all the way through â even the jasmine here smells more like violets in woodland than sultry white flowers. A warm, powdery trail lingers after the fireworks of the kaffir lime, oakmoss, and leather die down, the Siamese benzoin a sly nod to the South-East Asian inspiration for Chypre-Siam. Finally, a chypre that feels, smells, and actually is authentic.","oakmoss, kaffir lime, civet, jasmine, ylang-ylang, leather, spices, holy basil, sandalwood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,chypre siam joyful middle finger ifra unrepentedly teeming enough oakmoss make eu official faint fragrance lays lie notion 'just make 'em like used anymore ' chypre siam manuel cross proves possible make authentic chypre day age possible well sounds like battle cry cross mix oakmoss bergamot labdanum resin together would dull derivative instead chypre siam designed irreverent 'south east asian' take classic chypre tart kaffir lime topnote replacing traditional bergamot thai holy basil underline minty bitterness oakmoss underpinning raunchy civet inflected leather accord lends lascivious purr feels like labdanum ramped beyond normal range yet despite heavy sounding notes chypre siam retains fresh translucent greenness way even jasmine smells like violets woodland sultry white flowers warm powdery trail lingers fireworks kaffir lime oakmoss leather die siamese benzoin sly nod south east asian inspiration chypre siam finally chypre feels smells actually authentic,"oakmoss, kaffir lime, civet, jasmine, ylang-ylang, leather, spices, holy basil, sandalwood, benzoin"
Tabac Vert Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Tabac Vert is a gentle tobacco breeze blowing in from the past, when tobacco-focused fragrance compositions were not sweetened with vanilla or tonka bean. With references to vintage Tabarome and Krizia Moods, Tabac Vert presents us with a gentlemanly vision of what tobacco can smell like when played with a subtle hand.
The tobacco leaf in Tabac Vert is green and unsmoked - not yet 100% dry - and therefore has none of that ambery, dried fruit sweetness we are used to in modern tobacco scents. The main supporting character here is a dusty, spicy carnation that adds a slightly vintage feel. However, remarkably, nothing about this scent reads as dated. A peppery sandalwood and a fine dusting of subtle florals â rose and jasmine â give the tobacco-carnation heart a soft roundness that's comforting without being particularly sweet. Although the references here are all to great tobacco masculines of the past, we can't help but feel that a woman could totally rock this too.","tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tabac vert gentle tobacco breeze blowing past tobacco focused fragrance compositions sweetened vanilla tonka bean references vintage tabarome krizia moods tabac vert presents us gentlemanly vision tobacco smell like played subtle hand tobacco leaf tabac vert green unsmoked yet dry therefore none ambery dried fruit sweetness used modern tobacco scents main supporting character dusty spicy carnation adds slightly vintage feel however remarkably nothing scent reads dated peppery sandalwood fine dusting subtle florals rose jasmine give tobacco carnation heart soft roundness that's comforting without particularly sweet although references great tobacco masculines past can't help feel woman could totally rock,"tobacco, carnation, oakmoss, sandalwood, amber, pepper, bergamot, rose, jasmine"
Mousse Illuminee Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"Mousse Illuminee is a delightful anachronism. It smells manly in the best possible way â soapy, bright, and almost cleansing in its bitterness, a cornucopia of camphoraceous green notes such as cypress, laurel, and artemisia stuffed into a cedar chest, aromatizing it from the inside out. Fougeres used to smell like this, once upon a time, we remember. Now, shorn of any vanilla or sweetness, Mouse Illuminee returns the fougere to its original form, stripping it back until we are left with a powerful and invigorating 'forest fern' accord that is unabashedly masculine.
The deeply green atmosphere created by Mousse Illuminee revolves around a beautiful treemoss absolute from Robertet, but it is by no means the sole player. In particular, the minty laurel and camphoraceous aspects of the cypress and artemisia stand out, framed by an aquiline frankincense note that smells lightly smoky, but not burnt or severe. Best of all, there's no softening or fussiness towards the middle - a muscular musk simply carries the greenery on its broad shoulders to its natural conclusion.","treemoss, frankincense, green cypress, artemisia, laurel, cedar, white floral notes, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mousse illuminee delightful anachronism smells manly best possible way soapy bright almost cleansing bitterness cornucopia camphoraceous green notes cypress laurel artemisia stuffed cedar chest aromatizing inside fougeres used smell like upon time remember shorn vanilla sweetness mouse illuminee returns fougere original form stripping back left powerful invigorating 'forest fern' accord unabashedly masculine deeply green atmosphere created mousse illuminee revolves around beautiful treemoss absolute robertet means sole player particular minty laurel camphoraceous aspects cypress artemisia stand framed aquiline frankincense note smells lightly smoky burnt severe best there's softening fussiness towards middle muscular musk simply carries greenery broad shoulders natural conclusion,"treemoss, frankincense, green cypress, artemisia, laurel, cedar, white floral notes, white musk"
40 Rogue Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"40 Rogue is a recreation of the long-discontinued 40 Love by Jean Desprez, a fragrance that was apparently an interesting cross between an animalic, 1970s-style musk and a fougere. Given the opportunity to smell a vial of this forgotten gem, Manuel Cross decided that it wassimply too good to lose to the mists of time, and so here we are!
Fragrance fans not used to vintage perfume, or even vintage-style perfume, may want to adjust their television sets. 40 Rogue initially smells very vintage, with a burst of hairspray-ish aldehydes, wax-coated fruit, and a dusty carnation setting the scene in a pre-war diner in Paris, its spine straight and hair coiffed to an inch of its life. But this rich, formal air relaxes quickly, loosening its stays to let in gusts of aromatic, sunburnt herbs, lemon, and creamy, animalic musks that recall a fresher Jicky or even a jazzed-up Jovan's Musk (original 1970s formula). Fuzzy fruit, moss, and hay-like narcissus folded into a barbershoppy musk â what's not to like here?","citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/838004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rogue recreation long discontinued love jean desprez fragrance apparently interesting cross animalic style musk fougere given opportunity smell vial forgotten gem manuel cross decided wassimply good lose mists time fragrance fans used vintage perfume even vintage style perfume may want adjust television sets rogue initially smells vintage burst hairspray ish aldehydes wax coated fruit dusty carnation setting scene pre war diner paris spine straight hair coiffed inch life rich formal air relaxes quickly loosening stays let gusts aromatic sunburnt herbs lemon creamy animalic musks recall fresher jicky even jazzed jovan's musk original formula fuzzy fruit moss hay like narcissus folded barbershoppy musk what's like,"citrus, aldehydes, fruity notes, basil, tarragon, carnation, rose, narcissus, oakmoss, musk"
Derviche Eau de Toilette,Rogue Perfumery,"The brief Manuel Cross set himself for Derviche was simple â honor the famously soft green, powdery vanilla of vintage Emeraude by Coty but give it the power of one of those ambers coming out of the Middle-Eastern houses. In the end, Derviche smells very little like Emeraude but somehow features the same idea, which is to say a perfect balance struck between the tartness of citrus and the creamy sweetness of amber.
At heart, Derviche is really all about hookah. The tobacco accord here is incredibly rich, with dried cherry facets that will make you think of revani, a Turkish semolina cake soaked in a honey syrup so sweet it's almost sharp. Unlike Ambre Narguile by Hermes, which Derviche resembles slightly, the ambery tobacco has a little animalic kick in its tail to keep things interesting. Civet and saffron act together to form a dry, slightly funky animal leather accord, while ambergris gives the dry-down a salty-sweet muskiness that's entrancing.

Radish x Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash,"Radish and Vetiver- two roots with wildly different profiles. Vetiver, a staple of perfumery, grassy and sweet, earthy and spicy- a complex, multifaceted and often quite masculine aroma. Radish, on the other hand, not typically considered a desirably fragrant material, capable of the pungent sharpness of natural gas, but beneath the surface, possessed of a distinctive greenness and subtle citric qualities as well. An odd combination on paper, undeniably, but in the hands of Comme des Garcons, one that feels quintessentially CDG- the spice and earth of the vetiver made both more intense by the radish's petroleum-like tones, while also softened and brightened with the green elements. A scent that feels both uniquely natural and unnatural all at once- a sexy, fresh, and dare we say cutting-edge fragrance that anyone can pull off with panache.

Chlorophyll x Gardenia Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash,"Gardenia is a very distinctive note, known as a feminine and heady floral scent. To create a ""Clash, "" CDG worked on breaking down this overpowering essence with the freshness of chlorophyll. The results are as surprising as they are delightful- the fresh, airy greenness of the chlorophyll adds space and a touch of bitter contrast to gardenia's rich and romantic lushness, transposing the scent into pure unisex territory, with a vivacious energy to offset the natural floral warmth. Invigorating, fun, and glowing with sunny disposition, Chlorophyll x Gardenia is the kind of quirky yet everyday-appropriate modern scent that CDG has mastered.","chlorophyll, gardenia",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/839001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gardenia distinctive note known feminine heady floral scent create clash cdg worked breaking overpowering essence freshness chlorophyll results surprising delightful fresh airy greenness chlorophyll adds space touch bitter contrast gardenia's rich romantic lushness transposing scent pure unisex territory vivacious energy offset natural floral warmth invigorating fun glowing sunny disposition chlorophyll x gardenia kind quirky yet everyday appropriate modern scent cdg mastered,"chlorophyll, gardenia"
Celluloid x Galbanum Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons: Clash,"The association of Celluloid and Galbanum is by essence contradictory. They originate from the opposite realms of technology and nature, plastic and resin converging. But, of course, this is the brand that's given us Garage, Tar, Odeur 53, and Concrete, so should it really be a surprise when we say that Celluloid x Galbanum just... works? Most of all the Clash scents, Celluloid x Galbanum finds the unexpected serendipity between the powerful, naturally spiky green of galbanum, and the deeply evocative artificial freshness of celluloid, reminiscent of everything from plastic school binders to a fresh-from-the-box pair of sneakers.

The remote holiday of Tom Ford Soleil traverses from Courchevel to Megeve, inspiring Soleil Neige. The new Private Blend, alive with radiance and light-reflective ethereality, mimics the serene shimmer of sun on snow.

Wonder Of You Eau de Parfum,ALTAIA,"We all love gigantic, luxuriously romantic scents- the kind that evoke the feeling of love at first sight. But Wonder Of You, the newest from Altaia, evokes a more subtle, but no less powerful kind of love- the joy of everyday love, a celebration of all the special moments and beautiful details that sustain a lifelong romance. It's a sparkling, soothing cocktail of citrus and florals that will have you basking in the glow of love from morning to night. From the first spritz, Wonder Of You is a pure and refreshing delight, opening with a mouthwatering blend of tart grapefruit and crisp blackcurrant that could put a smile on even the most weary face.

Is there a secret formula to a happy life with the one you love? We're obviously not qualified to answer that.

Riviera Drive Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors,"The mythical scenic drive along the coastline of the French Riviera, so vividly captured in Hitchcock's To Catch A Thief with Grace Kelly and Cary Grant, is the inspiration for Riviera Drive, a thrillingly fresh new scent from Atelier des Ors. Just as the breathtaking views of the winding Cote d'Azure roads combine sun, sea, and flora as they weave through Menton on the way to St Tropez, so do does this fragrance combine vibrant citrus, electrifying aromatics, and sexy, soothing woody notes to evoke this iconic route. Riviera Drive opens with a vibrant spritz of bright lemon and the buzz of fresh herbs, giving us a grand panorama of the coastline from sky to land. As the woodsy notes emerge, we can picture our adventure taking us through the shade of the grand parasol pine trees, before a dash of intoxicating absinthe and a soothingly spiritual patchouli find us at our destination, exhausted but fulfilled, a sparkling cocktail in hand.

Pomelo Riviera Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors,"Pomelo Riviera whisks us away to the secluded garden of a villa overlooking the shimmering azure seas of the South of France. We smell an abundance of citrus trees, laden with fruits and fragrant flowers, caressed by a gentle ocean breeze. It's a vivid portrait of paradise- a moment in time we hope will never end. The unique beauty of Pomelo Riviera is the natural interplay between juicy tartness- zesty, radiant grapefruit and refreshing bergamot- and the silky smoothness of the deeply soothing floral bouquet of orange blossom, jasmine, and rose.

Riviera Lazuli Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors,"The warmest and richest of Atelier des Ors' Riviera trilogy, Riviera Lazuli is blissful blend of tart citrus and robust wood with a slow transition into a glowingly warm incense resin that evokes an unforgettable sunset over the azure waters of the Mediterranean. The outstanding citrus notes that have defined all three scents is still here, bright, juicy and robust, with a characteristically energetic spray of saltwater, but while a complement of aromatic woods is still present and vibrant, Riviera Lazuli moves in a duskier direction, with incense and and hints of dried immortelle providing warmth and a touch of caramel-inflected spice.

Yoyogi Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle,"Yoyogi Park is one of the most beloved and celebrated green spaces in Tokyo. Nestled between the ultra-hip youth fashion mecca of Harajuku and the bustling social center of Shibuya, Yoyogi is a serene oasis, miles of soft grass, sparkling ponds, and the shade of gingko trees- a park for everyday Tokyo residents to congregate, relax, and play. Tyler BrÃ»lÃ©, the founder of Monocle Magazine, found himself inspired during his morning jogs there, and so with the help of Comme des Garcons he set out to create a scent that captures the unique feeling of natural serenity that can occur in one of the world's busiest metropolises.
And true to form, Yoyogi is a scent both serene and energetic, a perfect combination of soothing green notes resting on the negative space of the smoky, spicy cityscape beyond. Aromatic cypress lends a distinctly contemplative Japanese character, while the unmistakable crispness of freshly cut grass immediately puts us in BrÃ»lÃ©'s jogging shoes on a dewey morning, the sun still low in the sky, the park nearly deserted and silent. As sweet, herbaceous chamomile and bitter, resinous wormwood emerge in the latter stages, we begin to experience the park- and Tokyo- at midday, an escape from the traffic and hustle but still fundamentally at the centre of the city- the kind of modern touch CDG is beloved for. Serene and natural, modern and exciting, all at one- that's the undeniably striking effect of a single spray of Yoyogi.","cypress, mown grass, chamomile, wormwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,yoyogi park one beloved celebrated green spaces tokyo nestled ultra hip youth fashion mecca harajuku bustling social center shibuya yoyogi serene oasis miles soft grass sparkling ponds shade gingko trees park everyday tokyo residents congregate relax play tyler br l founder monocle magazine found inspired morning jogs help comme des garcons set create scent captures unique feeling natural serenity occur one world's busiest metropolises true form yoyogi scent serene energetic perfect combination soothing green notes resting negative space smoky spicy cityscape beyond aromatic cypress lends distinctly contemplative japanese character unmistakable crispness freshly cut grass immediately puts us br l 's jogging shoes dewey morning sun still low sky park nearly deserted silent sweet herbaceous chamomile bitter resinous wormwood emerge latter stages begin experience park tokyo midday escape traffic hustle still fundamentally centre city kind modern touch cdg beloved serene natural modern exciting one that's undeniably striking effect single spray yoyogi,"cypress, mown grass, chamomile, wormwood"
Chloe Sevigny Little Flower Eau de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs,"From her beginning days as a 90's streetwear fashion icon and ""the coolest girl in the world"" to an award-winning career in film and television, Chloe Sevigny is truly one of a kind- a star who follows her own creativity and places passion over profit. Naturally, we knew her signature fragrance would have to be more than a by-the-numbers celebuscent, but Little Flower is so much more than we could have expected- a disarmingly fresh, exuberantly sexy rose that feels youthful and provocative all at once. Little Flower is built around rose, Sevigny's favorite note, and it's a beautiful specimen - a precious Ottoman rose absolute, romantic and bright, with a compellingly fleshy carnality. This raw appeal is tempered with sweet honeysuckle and fresh peony, and enhanced with the complexity of gently smoky black tea and the aromatic fruitiness of blackcurrant. A tart pomelo note adds a bright, youthful vivaciousness, which flows into a base of pillowy, clean musk. It's an arresting, versatile fragrance, to be worn by anyone with an artistic spirit and an independent soul. We'd expect nothing less.","black tea, bleeding heart, blackcurrant bud, peony, palo santo, pomelo, honeysuckle, rose absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,beginning days 's streetwear fashion icon coolest girl world award winning career film television chloe sevigny truly one kind star follows creativity places passion profit naturally knew signature fragrance would numbers celebuscent little flower much could expected disarmingly fresh exuberantly sexy rose feels youthful provocative little flower built around rose sevigny's favorite note beautiful specimen precious ottoman rose absolute romantic bright compellingly fleshy carnality raw appeal tempered sweet honeysuckle fresh peony enhanced complexity gently smoky black tea aromatic fruitiness blackcurrant tart pomelo note adds bright youthful vivaciousness flows base pillowy clean musk arresting versatile fragrance worn anyone artistic spirit independent soul we'd expect nothing less,"black tea, bleeding heart, blackcurrant bud, peony, palo santo, pomelo, honeysuckle, rose absolute, musk"
Baie 19 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"Truth is...Baie 19 should have been called Water 19. Not that it smells like nothing (though nothing smells like it), but it has this crisp, wet, drenched effect that water gives to the earth after the rain...And there's a word for that, by the way: petrichor. It's that magical feeling during heavy rain after a long dry spell, and it's one of the most beautiful olfactive phenomena in nature. There are many reasons for this, including the ozone in the air, the negative ions, but most importantly the release of oil secretions from certain plants, accumulated after a long dry period. This is what Baie 19 is about: the dry juniper berry, the patchouli, the green leaves... all soaked by a beautiful, luminous, magnetic rain after a long drought. And the joy that comes with it...

Across The Ocean Eau de Parfum,Gravel,"The story of Gravel is one that connects two continents- Europe and North America- so it's only appropriate that their second scent is a tribute to the invisible ties between the two, and the luxurious overseas steamer ships of yesteryear that used to ferry people of all walks of life to and from the old country. Across The Ocean is a robust scent of smooth, deep woods, rich oud, and luxurious musk that exudes the gentlemanly sophistication of a bygone era. Citrus adds a light, bright touch to the opening notes, while tonka, musk, and vanilla soften and sweeten the richness of the woodsy base. Conceived by Joseph Knudsen as a men's scent, we find it easily wearable by anyone who enjoys potent but balanced woodsiness- the kind of scent that signifies good taste and adventurous spirit, all without shouting.","bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,story gravel one connects two continents europe north america appropriate second scent tribute invisible ties two luxurious overseas steamer ships yesteryear used ferry people walks life old country across ocean robust scent smooth deep woods rich oud luxurious musk exudes gentlemanly sophistication bygone era citrus adds light bright touch opening notes tonka musk vanilla soften sweeten richness woodsy base conceived joseph knudsen men's scent find easily wearable anyone enjoys potent balanced woodsiness kind scent signifies good taste adventurous spirit without shouting,"bergamot, lemon, cashemere wood, oud, rose, tonka, gaiac, vanilla, musk"
Terrible Teddy Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"""Teddy lives for the thrill of the chase, ensnaring unsuspecting hearts with his scent.""
You can be forgiven if the plotlines of the Penhaligon's Portraits series have become a bit too convoluted to follow- to be honest, we're not quite sure we know what's going on at this point. Luckily, all that matters (aside from those jaw-dropping caps) is the scent, and Terrible Teddy is a robust, masculine, and surprisingly nuanced leather and incense gem. While the imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks to Teddy's impressive lasting power, there's refinement and subtlety at play here- the opening bursts with piquant spice, the leather is luxurious and supple, the incense delicately smoky with a perfectly metered dollop of dark woodsiness in the drydown, leavened with the warm airiness of ambroxan. With a secret weapon like this, it's no wonder Terrible Teddy has managed to ensnare so many unsuspecting hearts.","incense, leather, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,teddy lives thrill chase ensnaring unsuspecting hearts scent forgiven plotlines penhaligon's portraits series become bit convoluted follow honest we're quite sure know what's going point luckily matters aside jaw dropping caps scent terrible teddy robust masculine surprisingly nuanced leather incense gem imposing golden rhinoceros certainly speaks teddy's impressive lasting power there's refinement subtlety play opening bursts piquant spice leather luxurious supple incense delicately smoky perfectly metered dollop dark woodsiness drydown leavened warm airiness ambroxan secret weapon like wonder terrible teddy managed ensnare many unsuspecting hearts,"incense, leather, ambroxan"
Heartless Helen Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"""Who needs romance when one wields power?"" That's the tagline for Heartless Helen, which Penhaligon's tells us is the olfactory story of a fearless conquistadora, fresh off her latest conquest. But while we don't for a moment doubt that this fragrance, imbued with seductively lively tuberose, could give anyone the power to steal and break a few hearts, we wouldn't be so quick to paint Helen as a villain. To us, her signature scent is not only deeply sensual but also joyful and vibrant, a bouquet of narcotic white florals freshened with bright, juicy mandarin to capture the imagination. A gently creamy, warm woodsiness (we detect facets of sandalwood, gaiac, and cedar) adds sophistication and depth to the drydown, but the star of the show- the gorgeous, intoxicating tuberose- lasts from beginning to end. Is Heartless Helen truly as wicked as they say? Perhaps with a scent this brightly beautiful, it doesn't matter much- we're already in too deep.","mandarin orange, tuberose, creamy woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,needs romance one wields power that's tagline heartless helen penhaligon's tells us olfactory story fearless conquistadora fresh latest conquest moment doubt fragrance imbued seductively lively tuberose could give anyone power steal break hearts quick paint helen villain us signature scent deeply sensual also joyful vibrant bouquet narcotic white florals freshened bright juicy mandarin capture imagination gently creamy warm woodsiness detect facets sandalwood gaiac cedar adds sophistication depth drydown star show gorgeous intoxicating tuberose lasts beginning end heartless helen truly wicked say perhaps scent brightly beautiful matter much we're already deep,"mandarin orange, tuberose, creamy woods"
Plumeria de Orris Extrait de Parfum,Areej Le Dore,"This composition is dedicated to plumeria (known also as frangipani), the most gorgeous Asian flower. To find an extract that properly represents this flower is indeed a challenge. In Plumeria de Orris, we used nearly one kilogram of white frangipani extract that we believe captures the true nature of this exquisite blossom. We added a touch of genuine distilled plumeria oil, the rarest, most expensive floral essential oil we have ever encountered (at a price of over $200 per gram).
Soft, powdery whispers of plumeria, full of narcotic, head-spinning, creamy floral notes, uplift the olfactory senses. Orris butter absolute further enhances its powdery splendor, making its floral soul even more expansive, deeper and longer lasting. A gentle touch of apricot, with its honeyed flesh and velvety suede skin, boosts the plumeria's fruity aspect. It adds juicy sweetness and an almost gourmand nuance to the top notes.
Creamy floral notes slowly sink into buttery sandalwood. Wild aroma of civet adds a dash of animalic depth to the arrangement. Clouds of vanilla emerge from hiding behind the woods and deliver delicious olfactory joy.
Dense and incensey myrrh embraces oriental notes. Rich and resinous, this time-honored ingredient blends perfectly with dark and sooty vetiver. Virginian cedarwood provides a smoky, woody texture that perfectly completes this lush, luxurious composition and creates a well-balanced earthy backbone.
Plumeria, the floral soul of Asia, has been immersed in an apricot cocktail and magnified by oriental, incensey, animalic woods. Plumeria de Orris is a mesmerizing journey to Asia, a land that is both astonishingly wild and breathtakingly beautiful.","plumeria absolute, natural apricot accord orris root absolute, sandalwood, vanilla synthetic civet, myrrh, vetiver cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/784017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,composition dedicated plumeria known also frangipani gorgeous asian flower find extract properly represents flower indeed challenge plumeria de orris used nearly one kilogram white frangipani extract believe captures true nature exquisite blossom added touch genuine distilled plumeria oil rarest expensive floral essential oil ever encountered price per gram soft powdery whispers plumeria full narcotic head spinning creamy floral notes uplift olfactory senses orris butter absolute enhances powdery splendor making floral soul even expansive deeper longer lasting gentle touch apricot honeyed flesh velvety suede skin boosts plumeria's fruity aspect adds juicy sweetness almost gourmand nuance top notes creamy floral notes slowly sink buttery sandalwood wild aroma civet adds dash animalic depth arrangement clouds vanilla emerge hiding behind woods deliver delicious olfactory joy dense incensey myrrh embraces oriental notes rich resinous time honored ingredient blends perfectly dark sooty vetiver virginian cedarwood provides smoky woody texture perfectly completes lush luxurious composition creates well balanced earthy backbone plumeria floral soul asia immersed apricot cocktail magnified oriental incensey animalic woods plumeria de orris mesmerizing journey asia land astonishingly wild breathtakingly beautiful,"plumeria absolute, natural apricot accord orris root absolute, sandalwood, vanilla synthetic civet, myrrh, vetiver cedarwood"
Love Kills Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"While the concept of a soliflore might suggest simpler, more linear scents, one sniff of Love Kills should quickly disavow you of that notion. Instead, Caroline Dumur has created a rose soliflore with luscious yet edgy depth, one that masterfully plays off of the well known phrase it takes its name from to present both the romantic and dangerous sides of the grand dame of perfume florals.
On the ""Love"" side of things, the fragrance opens with joyful brightness, using a mouthwateringly juicy lychee note to introduce a sparkling, ambrette-tinted rose oxide. As it blossoms into a full-bodied, romantic Turkish rose absolute, we see the darker, more sensual, ""Killer"" side of the equation- sultrier floral tones, animalic musk, and a woodsy patchouli distillation with a decidedly...thorny quality. It's a portrait of love in full- the joy, the hope, the intensity, and even the heartbreak, all contained within the multifaceted beauty of a rose.","lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,concept soliflore might suggest simpler linear scents one sniff love kills quickly disavow notion instead caroline dumur created rose soliflore luscious yet edgy depth one masterfully plays well known phrase takes name present romantic dangerous sides grand dame perfume florals love side things fragrance opens joyful brightness using mouthwateringly juicy lychee note introduce sparkling ambrette tinted rose oxide blossoms full bodied romantic turkish rose absolute see darker sensual killer side equation sultrier floral tones animalic musk woodsy patchouli distillation decidedly thorny quality portrait love full joy hope intensity even heartbreak contained within multifaceted beauty rose,"lychee, rose oxide, ambrette, geranium, rose oil absolute, green notes, patchouli, ambrarome, immortelle, cedar, musk"
Oriental Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"At nightfall, the Wahiba Sands of Oman become a dreamscape of reddish dunes, casting a unique glow onto the sky above. The heavenly canopy lights up the path to Wadi Shab, a lush paradise, bursting forth from beyond the sand, etching itself permanently into the imagination.
A majestic and sophisticated scent, Oriental Leather is a rich tapestry of piquant spice, smooth resins, and a dusty floral leather note that combines with rich, dry patchouli to produce visions of a glowing desert night where the stars and the sand connect so seamlessly that it's impossible to tell where one ends and the next begins. At turns shimmeringly piquant and alluringly rich, it seems to dance on the skin, hypnotizing us with its exotic and otherworldly call.

Rolling in Love Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Rolling in Love is a musc de peau, capturing the sensation of feeling so high on love that it seems to almost get under the skin. Working with perfumer Pascal Gaurin, Kilian Hennessy took an entirely new direction. Rolling in Love is more direct and less faceted than his previous fragrances â almost monochromatic in its focused representation of a single emotion. Rolling in Love is a white scent, layering different textures along the scent's trail with notes of ambrette seeds, almond milk, iris, and musk. What We Think It may be conceived as a ""skin musk"" but there's plenty going on in this undeniably sexy blend of narcotic florals, creamy almond, and smooth, sensual musks.

Ambre Khandjar Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"The souq of Muttrah, found in the heart of Muscat, is the perfect place to search for a legendary Khandjar dagger- the identity, pride and heritage of Oman that carries the virtues of luck and protection from evil.

Jardins de Misfah Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"In the village of Misfah Al Abreyeen, a cornucopia of pomegranates, peaches, figs, and apricots grow abundantly in the midst of the mountain aridity, with marvelous palm trees as far as the eye can see, their branches heavy with the weight of dates. It is the bounty of legend come to life, an ingeniously engineered garden paradise created by warriors who set down their weapons to grow instead of destroy.
Jardins de Misfah is a harmony of ripeness- a whisper of fresh flower petals fused with an accord of creamy dates, syrupy honey and sweet rosewater.

Suma Oriental Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"Suma Oriental refers to the brilliant collection of writings by Tome Pires, a Portugese apothecary who became ambassador to China in the 16th century. An intensely detailed description of an insular southeast Asia, Suma Oriental revealed for the first time that sandalwood originated in the Sumba, or modern day Indonesia. So it's only fitting that Suma Oriental is a portrait of sandalwood in all of its rich dimensionality, a mesmerizing scent that pairs creamy, warm sandalwood with boozy rum, velvety patchouli, and powdery tonka to create a lushly seductive fragrance that hums with mystery and majesty. A robust cocoa note adds sweet, earthy complexity, while a gaiac-forward base of smooth woods supplement the sandalwood's mouthwatering depth.

Mr. Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"This is a story about a man who you may have encountered somewhere near Java.

Fleur des Fleurs Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"Bali, island of flowers. The ylang-ylang, sweet, rich, and luscious, is so highly prized for its complex fragrance and incomparable benefits for the mind and body that it means 'Flower of Flowers' in the Malay language. And jasmine is the queen of the night, patiently waiting for sunset so she can release her powerful, warm perfume into the air. Fleur des Fleurs is an ode to ylang-ylang and jasmine, an intense white floral accord with deep, romantic lushness. Freshness is provided with the crisp citric tang of grapefruit and the mouthwatering savor of saffron, while a deep, woodsy base of sandalwood and amber nourishes the soul.

Murmure des Dieux Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"Bali the Spiritual, the island that wakes up slowly each day to the rhythm of offerings. This is a time when women gather freshly cut flowers to accompany their religious rituals. Bali's iconic flower is the 'Jepun', or frangipani. It has a particular prestige for the Indonesian people and is part of their mystique; its vivid colors decorate most temples. Both a symbol of the god Shiva and a way to channel prayers, the frangipani flower evokes the island's inner voice. Murmure des Dieux is the very expression of lightness of the soul. An airy perfume taking the form of a reassuring whisper. An olfactory phrase like a mantra on the skin. This delicate accord intertwines the slightly almond and refined sweetness of the Frangipani flower, the unctuousness of vanilla and the reassuring roundness of musks.

Bohemian Soul Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"In 1966 the documentary 'Endless Summer' was released, chronicling two American surfers' quest for the perfect wave. From the end of their surfboards, we experience the desire to push time zones further away so the summer never ends. This quest continues, with the entire planet becoming a refuge of immense beaches punctuated with hiding places where free spirits love to converge.
Bohemian Soul is a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing fragrance that reflects this journey with elegance and modernity: the immediate freshness of artemisia, like a gentle wind rising up over the ocean, giving way to rooty iris and clean guaiac wood before the flourish of creamy sandalwood and the delicacy of soft, seductive musk entwine. It's a primally comforting mix, the kind of fresh musky scent perfect for women and men alike who crave clean and sporty in equal measures- a freshness that's as far from boring as the vagabonds and surfer kings who inspired it in the first place.","artemisia absinthium, olibanum, guaiac wood, iris, myrrh, musc, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,documentary 'endless summer' released chronicling two american surfers' quest perfect wave end surfboards experience desire push time zones away summer never ends quest continues entire planet becoming refuge immense beaches punctuated hiding places free spirits love converge bohemian soul bracing invigorating ultimately deeply soothing fragrance reflects journey elegance modernity immediate freshness artemisia like gentle wind rising ocean giving way rooty iris clean guaiac wood flourish creamy sandalwood delicacy soft seductive musk entwine primally comforting mix kind fresh musky scent perfect women men alike crave clean sporty equal measures freshness that's far boring vagabonds surfer kings inspired first place,"artemisia absinthium, olibanum, guaiac wood, iris, myrrh, musc, sandalwood"
Memory Motel Eau de Parfum,Une Nuit Nomade,"When Andy Warhol moved to Montauk, he became an anchor point, a lighthouse for an entire generation of artists. He rented his mansion for a summer to the Rolling Stones, who were rehearsing for their tour and pre-recording what would be one of their greatest albums, 'Black and Blue', which included the melancholy ballad 'Memory Motel'.
This eponymous perfume is a burning tribute to those restless, turbulent times. An androgynous perfume with notes of tobacco wrapped in patchouli leaves, pierced with a touch of vanilla. Smoky, spicy, mossy, and floral, with just the slightest hint of sweetness, it feels like it could be the smell of an iconically kitschy motel hallway, faded carpet and cigarette smoke, primally comforting, with seduction, adventure, relaxation, and beautiful mundanity hidden behind each subsequent door.","bergamot, iris, incense, carnation, mosses, patchouli, vanilla, tobacco, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/833007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,andy warhol moved montauk became anchor point lighthouse entire generation artists rented mansion summer rolling stones rehearsing tour pre recording would one greatest albums 'black blue' included melancholy ballad 'memory motel' eponymous perfume burning tribute restless turbulent times androgynous perfume notes tobacco wrapped patchouli leaves pierced touch vanilla smoky spicy mossy floral slightest hint sweetness feels like could smell iconically kitschy motel hallway faded carpet cigarette smoke primally comforting seduction adventure relaxation beautiful mundanity hidden behind subsequent door,"bergamot, iris, incense, carnation, mosses, patchouli, vanilla, tobacco, leather"

In Kalan, Parfums de Marly captures that beautiful balance through the juxtaposition of two quintessentially French heart notes--lush, lovely orange blossom, and bright, masculine lavender, for a fragrance that evokes the breathtaking splendor of the gardens at Versailles itself.

Harem Soiree Parfum,Arte Profumi,"A boozy rose dipped in honey and plunged into the salty rawness of ambergris, Harem Soiree is a stunning attar-like fragrance that takes no prisoners in the floral oriental genre. The ambergris lends a fiercely saline, windswept edge to the ambery underpinnings of the fragrance, joining with a resinous, licorice-like myrrh to render a picture of an unsweet, unpolished chunk of amber resin that has just washed up on a beach somewhere along the Baltic coast. The textural contrasts in Harem Soiree are incredibly satisfying, especially in the juxtaposition of the syrupy, honeyed rose against the rough-edged, salt-and-pepper dryness of the ambergris and myrrh notes. Rich in a mouthwateringly sweet-and-savory way that keeps you interested all day long, Harem Soiree has the additional advantage of being hugely radiant and sillage-aceous - outwitting humidity, showers, or whatever else you can throw at it. To wear Harem Soiree is to be bathed in your own personal halo of roses, precious resins, and salty ambergris, saturating the air around you in a heavy rose-gold hue. Divine.","ambergris, rose, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,boozy rose dipped honey plunged salty rawness ambergris harem soiree stunning attar like fragrance takes prisoners floral oriental genre ambergris lends fiercely saline windswept edge ambery underpinnings fragrance joining resinous licorice like myrrh render picture unsweet unpolished chunk amber resin washed beach somewhere along baltic coast textural contrasts harem soiree incredibly satisfying especially juxtaposition syrupy honeyed rose rough edged salt pepper dryness ambergris myrrh notes rich mouthwateringly sweet savory way keeps interested day long harem soiree additional advantage hugely radiant sillage aceous outwitting humidity showers whatever else throw wear harem soiree bathed personal halo roses precious resins salty ambergris saturating air around heavy rose gold hue divine,"ambergris, rose, myrrh"
Velvet Rouge,Arte Profumi,"Velvet Rouge is not for a perfume for wallflowers. Immediately enveloping and rich, it lustfully embraces the bold statement that only coffee beans, licorice, and cacao pods can make when exposed to high heat âÂ a delightfully aromatic, burnt aroma that fans of both Borneo 1838 by Serge Lutens and Coze by Parfumerie Generale will adore. Despite its cocoa-dusted opening, however, Velvet Rouge steers well away from the gourmand elements of its dark materials, choosing instead to chase the cocoa down with a hit of bright, spicy chili pepper and a dusting of nutmeg. With a rooty, slightly dirty-grungy vetiver and what smells to us like a ton of sooty frankincense bringing up the rear instead of the usual vanilla or amber, Velvet Noir retains its slightly austere, mysterious character throughout. It finishes out on an unusual accent of smoked-out licorice. A scent full of shadows and secrets, Velvet Rouge is perfect for those of few words and un-guessed-at depths.","cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,velvet rouge perfume wallflowers immediately enveloping rich lustfully embraces bold statement coffee beans licorice cacao pods make exposed high heat delightfully aromatic burnt aroma fans borneo serge lutens coze parfumerie generale adore despite cocoa dusted opening however velvet rouge steers well away gourmand elements dark materials choosing instead chase cocoa hit bright spicy chili pepper dusting nutmeg rooty slightly dirty grungy vetiver smells us like ton sooty frankincense bringing rear instead usual vanilla amber velvet noir retains slightly austere mysterious character throughout finishes unusual accent smoked licorice scent full shadows secrets velvet rouge perfect words un guessed depths,"cacao pod, coffee, chili pepper, mandarin orange, nutmeg, vetiver, licorice"
Bois Sacre Parfum,Arte Profumi,"Bois Sacre, or sacred wood, is an artistic rendering of the yin and yang character of two of the most precious woods in the world, namely Indian oud and sandalwood. Cleverly playing the animalic, leathery sourness of Indian oud off against the buttery, aromatic dryness of Indian sandalwood, the result is a scent that is exuberantly rich and full-flavored but not in the slightest bit heavy. The medley of woods here seems to shimmer in the air like the red dust over a North African desert. If the woods are remarkably airy, the doughy, treacly resinousness of labdanum moves quickly into place underneath to ground them. Growing ever drier and leatherier over time, we love how the labdanum lends an earthy, resinous heft that acts as a center of balance for the scent without ever drowning the woods in the buttery sweetness of vanilla. There's even a dusty 'hot paper' note in the drydown that makes us think of benzoin, even though none is listed. Dry but rich, this is the perfect woody oriental for cold weather.","agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bois sacre sacred wood artistic rendering yin yang character two precious woods world namely indian oud sandalwood cleverly playing animalic leathery sourness indian oud buttery aromatic dryness indian sandalwood result scent exuberantly rich full flavored slightest bit heavy medley woods seems shimmer air like red dust north african desert woods remarkably airy doughy treacly resinousness labdanum moves quickly place underneath ground growing ever drier leatherier time love labdanum lends earthy resinous heft acts center balance scent without ever drowning woods buttery sweetness vanilla there's even dusty 'hot paper' note drydown makes us think benzoin even though none listed dry rich perfect woody oriental cold weather,"agarwood (oud), sandalwood, labdanum"
Samharam Parfum,Arte Profumi,"Samharam is a rich incense scent that traces a straight line to the ancient aromas of myrrh and benzoin that would have accompanied the caravan traders that moved from across the deserts from the spice and resin markets of Somalia and Oman to Venice and beyond. Opening with a triumphantly coca cola-ish myrrh with smoky licorice overtones, Samharam rolls on like a stone, picking up the deeply sooty nuances of Somali frankincense and elemi, as well as the sweeter 'hot brown paper' powderiness of benzoin. Samharam smells both sacred and profane, the ethereal 'High Church' lift of the incense raising our thoughts up to the heavens, while all the time enticing our more gustatory senses with a pleasing bite of black pepper and a slightly salty amber. Although not foody in the slightest, there's something piquant in this incense accord that pricks the saliva glands and makes our bellies growl. Incredibly full-figured and rich, as all Arte Profumi fragrances are, Samharam is the old world Italian artisanal response to the thin and bony incense scents of modern lore.","myrrh, incense, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,samharam rich incense scent traces straight line ancient aromas myrrh benzoin would accompanied caravan traders moved across deserts spice resin markets somalia oman venice beyond opening triumphantly coca cola ish myrrh smoky licorice overtones samharam rolls like stone picking deeply sooty nuances somali frankincense elemi well sweeter 'hot brown paper' powderiness benzoin samharam smells sacred profane ethereal 'high church' lift incense raising thoughts heavens time enticing gustatory senses pleasing bite black pepper slightly salty amber although foody slightest there's something piquant incense accord pricks saliva glands makes bellies growl incredibly full figured rich arte profumi fragrances samharam old world italian artisanal response thin bony incense scents modern lore,"myrrh, incense, benzoin"
Sucre Noir Parfum,Arte Profumi,"Sucre Noir deserves the same Holy Grail status granted by vanilla lovers to Tihota by Indult or Vaniglia by Mazzolari. One of the most luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled, it is the olfactory equivalent of being wrapped up in the purest, 'whitest' cashmere blanket that costs more than most of us earn in a month. There's a luxury in its simplicity, because there's nowhere for any mistakes to hide. Recalling nothing more than the nostalgic goodness of white sugar infused with the sultry warmth of a vanilla bean or two, and perhaps a breath of cocoa-dusted vanilla orchid, it is the sort of vanilla we loved first while learning about taste and smell â that pure 'white' sort of sweetness as of yet unsullied by smoke, musk, or resin. The cane sugar is the perfect final touch, its slightly burnt, brown sugar aroma adding an interesting caramelization that creates depth but not shade. Vanilla lovers â we are putting you on notice!","orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/834000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sucre noir deserves holy grail status granted vanilla lovers tihota indult vaniglia mazzolari one luxurious vanilla scents we've ever smelled olfactory equivalent wrapped purest 'whitest' cashmere blanket costs us earn month there's luxury simplicity there's nowhere mistakes hide recalling nothing nostalgic goodness white sugar infused sultry warmth vanilla bean two perhaps breath cocoa dusted vanilla orchid sort vanilla loved first learning taste smell pure 'white' sort sweetness yet unsullied smoke musk resin cane sugar perfect final touch slightly burnt brown sugar aroma adding interesting caramelization creates depth shade vanilla lovers putting notice,"orchid, vanilla pod, sugar cane"
Oeilleres Parfum Extrait,Roberto Greco,"""I want to echo the flowers I photograph without referring to any one in particular. Therefore, along with Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, we decided to exclude rose, jasmine and all the overly tangible flowers. We managed to express the general idea of floralcy through the dried flower, pollen and honey facets of chamomile and broom. To connect the scent with the figures I photograph, I also wanted to convey the feel of flesh. In order to achieve this, we brought out the animal aspects of vegetal notes, as well as various spices and resins. Though it wasn't an end in itself, the fragrance is bursting with natural ingredients sometimes in very high doses, all the better to express the organic duality of my images. Between the delicacy of a fading petal and the radicality of a fold of skin."" Roberto Greco

Slow Dance Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"The slow dance: a rite of passage for girls and boys before they metamorphose into women and men. A feeling of exhilaration tempered, or perhaps heightened, by awkwardness. A heady collision of innocence and experience, knowing and not knowing, felt universally across countries, cultures, and time. Slow Dance: a scent that evokes these collective memories and experiences in a unisex oriental amber, bitter and sweet, intoxicating and youthful. A top note of sweet myrrh provides an immediate honeyed, smoky sensuality against a heart of creamy, ambery labdanum and sparkling fresh geranium. All is swathed in a magical veil of violet, while a base of vanilla and patchouli anchor the amber notes, a contrast between sweet and earthy, mouthwatering and mysterious, that brings our minds back to school gymnasiums and stolen kisses.

L'Air Des Alpes Suisses Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"Andy Tauer has a singular gift for olfactory mise en scene: fragrances so majestically evocative that you feel transported not only to a location, but into an experience: strolling through a Rahat marketplace at sunset (L'Air du Desert Marocain), ripping down Route 66 in a panhead Harley-Davidson (Lonesome Rider), or looking up at the Southwest sky next to a crackling fire (Lonestar Memories). For his newest experience, Andy invites us to the country where he lives and creates amongst the pristine natural beauty of the Swiss Alps.
L'Air Des Alpes Suisses opens bright, fresh, and invigorating, with notes of bitter, lively alpine herbs and cool glacier air. As if on our own Swiss adventure, our journey then leads us into the fresh, green heart, the air rich with blooming alpine lilies and pine needles drying on the forest floor. And finally, we smell the warm woods of the timber trees, sweetened with the amber tones of earth drying in the midday sun. It's about as different from most of his previous offerings as can be, but for one simple truth- it's deeply, beautifully evocative in the way that only Tauer can be.

La Couche du Diable Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"La Couche du Diable (we'll choose to forego some of the raunchier translations and simply call it ""The Devil's Bed"") was bound to cause a fuss- after all, throughout his many releases, Serge Lutens has never before featured oud in a fragrance. But with that in mind, don't expect anything resembling a typical oud scent. Oh, there's an unmistakably high-quality oud in here- darkly woodsy, warm, and sweetly balsamic- but its more challengingly animalic tones are, if not subverted, at least channeled into resinous cistus and syrupy fruit-and-rose combination that incite a sense of deep, seductive comfort. Serge Lutens' own copy describes La Couche du Diable as ""a diabolical and sumptuous veil of indulgence and remorse for a first transgression.""

This breathtaking natural beauty is the inspiration for Patricia and Axel de Nicolai's newest leather scent, a robust yet velvet-soft offering that eschews the garishness of brutal, flashy leathers for the smoothness of freshly-tanned suede, placed expertly in the midst of the crisp and invigorating scents of a wild Siberian birch forest. The leather aspect of this EDP is essentially created by blending two dry, woody notes: essence of gaiac wood and essence of smoked pine. This powerful duet is revealed by a fiery start of spicy citrus with yuzu, pepper and saffron, while the aromatic touch of spearmint completes the top note. The floral heart of rose and violet envelops the leather, softened by an iris butter, tonka beans and white musk background.

Squid Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"The vast ocean swells and contracts, caught in the relentless tug of the moon. Beneath the surface, a school of squid emerges. Strange, elastic forms propel from the deep in a frantic search for sustenance. They are not alone. Their predators lunge, only to be foiled by blinding jets of murky ink. A massive sperm whale dives, leaving a temporary peace bobbing in its wake. Lumps of ambergris, expelled by the whale and polished by the salty currents, wash ashore. Waste? Flotsam? To the perfumer, this elusive substance is nothing less than treasure.
Zoologist Squid sings a song of a dark, tumultuous sea of tangy brine, the stormy air electrified with pink pepper and the elemental glow of salicylate.

Los Angeles Eau de Parfum,Gallivant,"A perfect day in Los Angeles might start early, as a sparkling ray of morning sunlight illuminates an abundance of flowering native florae. That same day might end late, but not too late, as the last notes of your favorite band echo off the starlit hills surrounding the Hollywood Bowl. Sure, L.A. may not have much of a claim to being The City That Never Sleeps, but with beginnings and endings as beautiful as ours, who says that's a bad thing?
That perfect morning spent in your blooming garden? That's the airy, aromatic opening of Los Angeles, as vivid notes of eucalyptus and clary sage, along with a spritz of oceanside saltiness, stimulate a sense of calm, relaxed, natural energy- the very spirit of L.A. itself. A rich and spicy floral heart- tuberose and narcissus- celebrates the vibrant and romantic Mexican culture diffused through the heart of the city. And finally, a smoky, woodsy, shimmering base of cade and gaiac represents the boundless and far-flung nightlife, which often combines L.A.'s reputation for creativity and artistic innovation with the bounty of natural beauty and outdoor space at our fingertips. Sure, we might head home before the sun comes up- but as Gallivant's perfect tribute to our hometown proves, it's because tomorrow promises to be just as full of adventure as today.","eucalyptus, clary sage, mandarin, pineapple, tuberose, narcissus, cade, gaiac, nagarmotha, musk, heliotrope",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perfect day los angeles might start early sparkling ray morning sunlight illuminates abundance flowering native florae day might end late late last notes favorite band echo starlit hills surrounding hollywood bowl sure l may much claim city never sleeps beginnings endings beautiful says that's bad thing perfect morning spent blooming garden that's airy aromatic opening los angeles vivid notes eucalyptus clary sage along spritz oceanside saltiness stimulate sense calm relaxed natural energy spirit l rich spicy floral heart tuberose narcissus celebrates vibrant romantic mexican culture diffused heart city finally smoky woodsy shimmering base cade gaiac represents boundless far flung nightlife often combines l 's reputation creativity artistic innovation bounty natural beauty outdoor space fingertips sure might head home sun comes gallivant's perfect tribute hometown proves tomorrow promises full adventure today,"eucalyptus, clary sage, mandarin, pineapple, tuberose, narcissus, cade, gaiac, nagarmotha, musk, heliotrope"

Kintsugi Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"""Cherish the simple. Cherish the old. Do not hide your scars, show them with pride.""
This simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures the ethos behind the ancient Japanese technique of Kintsugi, or Kintsukuroi, which repairs broken pottery using gold-infused lacquer, highlighting instead of obfuscating the cracks and celebrating the beauty and strength of imperfection. With this as inspiration, Masque Milano and perfumer Vanina Muracciole delivers a ""rediscovered"" chypre, pieced back together with a golden vein of suede leather that both restores and reimagines the structure of the style. Traditional elements of bright, bracing bergamot and rich, refined patchouli remain, but oakmoss has been replaced with a salty, savory amber accord that complements the glowing suede heart with an unmistakable fine-grain shimmer. A lovely touch of femininity comes by way of fresh, elegant Grasse rose centifolia and watery magnolia, while the aforementioned patchouli- fractionally distilled to strip away the mustiest aspects- rebalances the composition to sophisticated, unisex bliss. Whether you're a chypre lover looking for a loving reinterpretation, or simply a fan of Masque Milano's elegant yet unpretentious, creator-driven fragrances, Kintsugi is every bit the sparkling treasure its name makes it out to be.","bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cherish simple cherish old hide scars show pride simple yet powerful sentiment perfectly captures ethos behind ancient japanese technique kintsugi kintsukuroi repairs broken pottery using gold infused lacquer highlighting instead obfuscating cracks celebrating beauty strength imperfection inspiration masque milano perfumer vanina muracciole delivers rediscovered chypre pieced back together golden vein suede leather restores reimagines structure style traditional elements bright bracing bergamot rich refined patchouli remain oakmoss replaced salty savory amber accord complements glowing suede heart unmistakable fine grain shimmer lovely touch femininity comes way fresh elegant grasse rose centifolia watery magnolia aforementioned patchouli fractionally distilled strip away mustiest aspects rebalances composition sophisticated unisex bliss whether chypre lover looking loving reinterpretation simply fan masque milano's elegant yet unpretentious creator driven fragrances kintsugi every bit sparkling treasure name makes,"bergamot, magnolia, amber, suede, rose, violet leaf, benzoin, raspberry leaf, patchouli, vanilla"

Ta'if Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"The Ta'if rose- greener, spicier, more vibrant than the lusher European varietals- was the perfect centerpiece to the original Ta'if EDP, where sweet spice and gentle, watery florals defined a light, elegant rose scent with a restrained touch of gourmand exoticism. In Elixir form, however, a dramatic new element emerges with the addition of precious Cambodian oudh, which introduces a rich, warm, animalic sensuality. While it'd be hard to argue that this doesn't add some heaviness to a previously lighter-than-air composition, we urge you to think of Ta'if Elixir as its own, separate fragrance- one where the oudh turns the peppery florals into something sweepingly romantic and thoroughly, three-dimensionally gorgeous. Ta'if Elixir is a scent to be worn with reckless abandon, a breathtaking perfume of tremendous presence and timeless elegance. What We Think Quite different from the airy, subtle Ta'if EDP, and miles apart from a typical rose-oud combination as well. Deep, rich, and authentically warm and animalic.","pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77758.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ta'if rose greener spicier vibrant lusher european varietals perfect centerpiece original ta'if edp sweet spice gentle watery florals defined light elegant rose scent restrained touch gourmand exoticism elixir form however dramatic new element emerges addition precious cambodian oudh introduces rich warm animalic sensuality it'd hard argue add heaviness previously lighter air composition urge think ta'if elixir separate fragrance one oudh turns peppery florals something sweepingly romantic thoroughly three dimensionally gorgeous ta'if elixir scent worn reckless abandon breathtaking perfume tremendous presence timeless elegance think quite different airy subtle ta'if edp miles apart typical rose oud combination well deep rich authentically warm animalic,"pink pepper, saffron, dates, rose, freesia, orange blossom, jasmine, broom, amber, oud"
Royal Elixir Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum was, and is, a head-turner. From the surprisingly bright green and citrus opening to the sweet and spicy florals, it was a decidedly new kind of amber scent- all of the dreamy indulgence of amber, but none of the heaviness. Royal Elixir doesn't mess with a perfect thing, and so the key notes of Ambre Royal are unaltered- bergamot, jasmine, amber, patchouli. And yet, when concentrated to parfum strength for the Elixir, new heights of complexity are reached- sweet, fresh, warm, and powdery elements intertwine with hypnotic power. And just like that, one of our all time favorite amber scents gets even more unique. What We Think Like the original Ambre Royal, a sophisticated, elegant floral amber- the Elixir concentration brings out the full lushness of the romantic florals and the powdered richness of the tonka and patchouli.","green notes, orange, bergamot, jasmine, rose, amber, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77759.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambre royal eau de parfum head turner surprisingly bright green citrus opening sweet spicy florals decidedly new kind amber scent dreamy indulgence amber none heaviness royal elixir mess perfect thing key notes ambre royal unaltered bergamot jasmine amber patchouli yet concentrated parfum strength elixir new heights complexity reached sweet fresh warm powdery elements intertwine hypnotic power like one time favorite amber scents gets even unique think like original ambre royal sophisticated elegant floral amber elixir concentration brings full lushness romantic florals powdered richness tonka patchouli,"green notes, orange, bergamot, jasmine, rose, amber, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk"

The latest example is Brume du Matin, a gorgeously delicate summer floral that truly does capture the refreshing bliss of a misty seaside morning.

Cuir de Chine Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"In Les IndÃ©modablesâ Cuir de Chine (âChinese Leatherâ), the usually delicate, apricot-faceted osmanthus note is boldly paired with a beautifully fresh and realistic tobacco leaf to create an accord.
The result? Delicate yet assertive, classic yet modern, light as spring yet redolent of a tobacconistsâs leather-and-wood scented atelier, Cuir de Chine is a seamless balancing act of opposites that smoothly draws you into its elegant, romantic world that almost incites visions of sepia-tinted daguerreotype photographed flowers.
As Cuir de Chine dries down and continues to bloom on skin, the oscillation between fresh and funky continues apace, as a fatty and indolic jasmine and bright herbal clary sage echo the osmanthus and tobacco leaf pairing to create what almost smells like an aromatic Chinese tea softened with milk, or curiously, even perfume-scented money.

Cuoio Dei Dolci Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Literally translating to ""Sweet Leather"", Cuoio dei Dolci is a rare kind of hybrid- one that draws equally from the smoky animalic intensity of leather and the mouthwatering richness of a gourmand to create a perfectly balanced, exquisitely sensual treasure. This 100% natural confection, described by none other than Luca Turin as ""a gingerbread ottoman that hits all the buttons, "" features a heavy dose of castoreum as its primary ingredient- intense, animalic, and primally erotic. But lest you worry that Cuoio dei Dolci tilts too far towards the carnal, a luxurious counterweight of powdered, vanillic tonka softens the harsh edges, joining a sweet, naturalistic tobacco leaf to refine the leather and stir the senses. Supplemental notes of earthy cocoa, smooth vanilla, and sweet ylang add to the indulgent sophistication, while a base of robust, creamy sandalwood keeps everything at the perfect intersection of the dining room and the smoking parlor.

Notorious Oud Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"With Notorious Oud, D.S. & Durga pay tribute to one of the greatest legends to ever emerge from their home borough of Brooklyn- Christopher Wallace, better known as The Notorious B.I.G. But if you think the inspiration is merely surface level, you're dead wrong- like the charming, rough-edged, impossibly clever rhymes of Frank White himself, Notorious Oud showcases a versatile and often misunderstood fragrant ingredient with the type of irreverent panache that leaves competitors sputtering like the Madd Rapper. Biggie references aside, how does Notorious Oud actually smell? Start with the oud itself, a rich Indonesian specimen (""smell the Indonesia,"" as the great man once rapped) with a robust balance of smoky, earthy, and animalic tones. Afghani saffron and white galbanum enhance the green, spicy energy, while a lush Bulgarian rose feels as smooth and suave as Big Poppa. We could go on, but we'll leave you instead with one last Biggie quote to capture how we feel about Notorious Oud: ""Stay far from timid/only make moves when your heart's in it/and live the phrase sky's the limit...""","saffron, camphor, white galbanum, oud, rose, lavender, civet, cetalox, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/686084.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,notorious oud durga pay tribute one greatest legends ever emerge home borough brooklyn christopher wallace better known notorious b g think inspiration merely surface level dead wrong like charming rough edged impossibly clever rhymes frank white notorious oud showcases versatile often misunderstood fragrant ingredient type irreverent panache leaves competitors sputtering like madd rapper biggie references aside notorious oud actually smell start oud rich indonesian specimen smell indonesia great man rapped robust balance smoky earthy animalic tones afghani saffron white galbanum enhance green spicy energy lush bulgarian rose feels smooth suave big poppa could go we'll leave instead one last biggie quote capture feel notorious oud stay far timid/only make moves heart's it/and live phrase sky's limit,"saffron, camphor, white galbanum, oud, rose, lavender, civet, cetalox, papyrus"

Fougere Emeraude Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"A tuberose fougÃ¨re. Thatâs not something you hear about every day, but once you smell it in FougÃ¨re Emeraude, it seems like the perfect way to both highlight and steer this floral note in an interesting direction that deconstructs the gender categories a floral or a fougÃ¨re would ordinarily suggest.
But if you love tuberose, donât worry, FougÃ¨re Emeraude hands it to you in a hefty 15 percent dose, with all of its sweet creaminess and subtle green accents. No waiting in the wings for this oneâit gets right down to business at first sniff. Itâs supported by a Moroccan mimosa absolute, honeyed and bright, extracted at Les IndÃ©modableâs lab from hand-selected flower buds only â no stems allowed.
Lavender and clary sage add a haunting, aromatic quality to FougÃ¨re Emeraude, along with subtle spiciness, while tonka smooths out the entire composition with its comforting facets of vanilla and cinnamon. The care with which each ingredient is sourced and extracted by Les IndÃ©modables is evident once again in FougÃ¨re Emeraude, and by the time this rests and dries down on your skin, the subtle harmonies among the notes, thanks to perfumer Florence Fouillet Dubois, meld to create something delicious, complex, and unlike anything weâve smelled before.","tuberose, lavender, tonka absolute, mimosa absolute, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tuberose foug something hear every day smell foug emeraude seems like perfect way highlight steer floral note interesting direction deconstructs gender categories floral foug would ordinarily suggest love tuberose worry foug emeraude hands hefty percent dose sweet creaminess subtle green accents waiting wings one gets right business first sniff supported moroccan mimosa absolute honeyed bright extracted les ind modable lab hand selected flower buds stems allowed lavender clary sage add haunting aromatic quality foug emeraude along subtle spiciness tonka smooths entire composition comforting facets vanilla cinnamon care ingredient sourced extracted les ind modables evident foug emeraude time rests dries skin subtle harmonies among notes thanks perfumer florence fouillet dubois meld create something delicious complex unlike anything smelled,"tuberose, lavender, tonka absolute, mimosa absolute, clary sage"
Gentle Fluidity Silver Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"Gentle fluidity â note the small f â is part of perfumer Francis Kurkdjianâs experiment to see what happens when you set out with an identical set of notes but head off in two separate directions. The result? A complementary (but utterly different) pair of fragrances - gentle Fluidity (Gold) and Gentle fluidity (Silver) â that prove that a painterâs palette is just a starting point and that the magic only happens when the painter picks up his brush. Two distinct forms emerge from the masterâs art â one for him and one for her. Both sharing the same DNA.
Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the fresher of this charming duo. Immediately, the fresh gin-and-tonic fizz of juniper berry dominates, followed closely by a spiced woody note thatâs not quite as sharp as pine but still redolent of the cool, aromatic aroma of a coniferous forest. The coriander lends a metallic, peppery sheen to the woods that lifts the ashy greenness of the traditional fougÃ¨re-like accord in the heart and modernizes it for the young professional we see this fitting to a T. Crisp, fresh, and with a certain champagne-like sparkle that connects the dots to its warmer, richer Gold counterpart, Gentle fluidity (Silver) is the kind of scent you can dress up with a white shirt and tie, or dress down in khakis, and it will never be less than perfect.","juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49887.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gentle fluidity note small f part perfumer francis kurkdjian experiment see happens set identical set notes head two separate directions result complementary utterly different pair fragrances gentle fluidity gold gentle fluidity silver prove painter palette starting point magic happens painter picks brush two distinct forms emerge master art one one sharing dna gentle fluidity silver fresher charming duo immediately fresh gin tonic fizz juniper berry dominates followed closely spiced woody note quite sharp pine still redolent cool aromatic aroma coniferous forest coriander lends metallic peppery sheen woods lifts ashy greenness traditional foug like accord heart modernizes young professional see fitting crisp fresh certain champagne like sparkle connects dots warmer richer gold counterpart gentle fluidity silver kind scent dress white shirt tie dress khakis never less perfect,"juniper, nutmeg, coriander, musk, amber, woods, vanilla"

The spice in gentle Fluidity is subtle but noticeable, the coriander berry in particular lending a gently champagne-like fizz that lifts the sultry vanilla pudding accord and gives it a metallic sparkle.

Oriental Velours Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"Oriental Velours is as plush as its name suggests, plunging you into a hypnotic reverie of warm, spicy resins, creamy vanilla, and aromatic notes recalling bracing woods and pine needles. Its centerpiece is myrrh, with its woody, subtle licorice facet which finds resonance with vanilla and what smells like a hint of cinnamon. Although the church incense quality of myrrh isn't overdone here, there's certainly enough to subliminally suggest rituals and to possibly incite devotion at its perfumed altar.
An almost smoky vetiver pulls the warm notes of Oriental Velours together with its brightness and elegance, adding some lightness to the otherwise nocturnal character of this fragrance. Like all of the fragrances in Les Indemodables' collection, there's a seamless melding together of notes in Oriental Velours that quietly draws you in with its mysterious beauty.","jasmine alcoolat, vanilla, myrrh, vetiver, spruce oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oriental velours plush name suggests plunging hypnotic reverie warm spicy resins creamy vanilla aromatic notes recalling bracing woods pine needles centerpiece myrrh woody subtle licorice facet finds resonance vanilla smells like hint cinnamon although church incense quality myrrh overdone there's certainly enough subliminally suggest rituals possibly incite devotion perfumed altar almost smoky vetiver pulls warm notes oriental velours together brightness elegance adding lightness otherwise nocturnal character fragrance like fragrances les indemodables' collection there's seamless melding together notes oriental velours quietly draws mysterious beauty,"jasmine alcoolat, vanilla, myrrh, vetiver, spruce oil"
Musk Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"When you have access to raw materials as exceptionally high quality as those used in Bortnikoff scents, the word ""cologne"" should never be mistaken to mean a fragrance is light or fleeting. Instead, it's an invitation to discover the tremendous amount of depth that the traditionally fresh style can contain- something we first learned with their ambergris-laden Amber Cologne. But Musk Cologne is something else altogether, an arresting combination of vibrant citrus, smooth florals, and rich, warm musk that thrums with sensual energy that simply must be experienced to be believed. Gently spicy, subtly smoky, and compellingly animalic, this is a musk note of remarkable sophistication, so striking that it upends the staid expectations for an eau-de-cologne style fragrance and reinvents it as something potent and seductive, even while maintaining a cheerful and energetic exterior. Or to put it another way- you've never smelled a cologne quite like this.","bergamot, lemon, tangerine, sweet orange, green tea, lily of the valley, magnolia, tuberose, ylang-ylang, deer musk, sandalwood, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,access raw materials exceptionally high quality used bortnikoff scents word cologne never mistaken mean fragrance light fleeting instead invitation discover tremendous amount depth traditionally fresh style contain something first learned ambergris laden amber cologne musk cologne something else altogether arresting combination vibrant citrus smooth florals rich warm musk thrums sensual energy simply must experienced believed gently spicy subtly smoky compellingly animalic musk note remarkable sophistication striking upends staid expectations eau de cologne style fragrance reinvents something potent seductive even maintaining cheerful energetic exterior put another way never smelled cologne quite like,"bergamot, lemon, tangerine, sweet orange, green tea, lily valley, magnolia, tuberose, ylang-ylang, deer musk, sandalwood, gaiac"
Mandarino di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"With so many wonderful new citrus fragrances available this summer, what makes Mandarino di Sicilia stand out from the crowd? The answer might sound silly but, well- it's the mandarin.

Bergamotto di Calabria Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"The oldest and most revered method for extracting Calabrian bergamot oil is performed by hand using a specially curved knife and a natural sponge. It's a painstaking process, requiring 200kg of fruit for a single litre of essential oil, and thus it is rarely employed today, but it sidesteps the quality control issues inherent in mechanical extraction to produce a fragrant essence of the most delicate, complex quality, a perfect blend of tart, juicy freshness and smooth, sophisticated floral tones. It's this uniquely exceptional bergamot that defines the character of Bergamotto di Calabria, supplemented with a fiery jolt of ban timur and pink peppers, smoothed with a delicate white floral heart, and given warm, creamy depth with a musky sandalwood base.

Arancia di Sicilia Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"In perfumery the essential oil from bitter oranges carries greater value than that of more common sweeter varieties. The Sanguinella Orange is the exception to the rule due to its exceptionally high quality.

A Man's Cologne Eau de Parfum,Gravel,"There are fragrances that are defined by their era, and then there are fragrances that outlast their own era and become immortal. Gravel is just such a fragrance. Originally invented by Michael Knudsen in 1957, Gravel A Man's Cologne was a different sort of men's scent right from the start- sold exclusively at select boutiques and featuring a distinctive profile- fresh, fruity citrus that transitions into a never-too-heavy blend of balsamic woody notes. The base blends powdery tonka, a secret selection of spices, and a mineralic, lightly industrial aura of incense and vetiver that does indeed call to mind the name of the fragrance- and yes, those are real pieces of gravel in the bottle, perhaps imbuing their own unique character over time. The result is a scent that we'd imagine has the exact same balance of elegant classicism and sexy modernity in 2019 as it did more than half a century ago. Gravel A Man's Cologne is, by any standard, a legendary scent. Who couldn't use one of those in their life?","bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/829000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrances defined era fragrances outlast era become immortal gravel fragrance originally invented michael knudsen gravel man's cologne different sort men's scent right start sold exclusively select boutiques featuring distinctive profile fresh fruity citrus transitions never heavy blend balsamic woody notes base blends powdery tonka secret selection spices mineralic lightly industrial aura incense vetiver indeed call mind name fragrance yes real pieces gravel bottle perhaps imbuing unique character time result scent we'd imagine exact balance elegant classicism sexy modernity half century ago gravel man's cologne standard legendary scent use one life,"bergamot, orange, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, incense, vetiver, musk"
Villa Nellcote Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""Never has a house been so closely associated with the creation of a rock album. This was a summer that would change the history of music forever. The fragrance Villa Nellcote is the embodiment of the magnificent garden and surroundings at the estate with the same name."" -Johan Bergelin Villa Nellcote, a 19th-century mansion overlooking Villefranche Bay on France's Cote d'Azur, has what could generously be called a colorful past- after serving as a Gestapo headquarters during the Nazi occupation of France, the Villa was reclaimed for ""allied"" debauchery when it was famously rented in the summer of 1971 to serve as the party palace and studio of the Rolling Stones as they recorded their classic album Exile On Main Street. Using the lushly landscaped grounds as an inspiration, Villa Nellcote the fragrance is a smooth, confident unisex floral, boasting a bouquet of lush flowers enriched with a piquant blend of fresh green citrus and spice. We picture ourselves atop the grand outdoor staircase overlooking the lavish gardens, with a subtly smoky base of black tea, patchouli and woods the only indication of the rock-star hedonism happening in the cellar-turned-studio, hidden away from prying eyes.

Portrayal embodies an artist's ability to reconnect fragments from different times and places.

Musc des Sables Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"What do you get when you combine two of the costliest ingredients in perfumery â ambergris and orris â with animalic musks and spices? In Antoine Lie's hands, a mysteriously sexy elixir that melts into skin, leaving a sheer but substantial trace of fairy dust that's subtly sweet, spicy, sensuous, and ever-evolving.
Musc des Sables opens with a fresh, bright mandarin note that seamlessly transitions into cozy, spiced opulence. Ambergris in contemporary, even luxury perfumes, is mostly synthetic due to its price and scarcity, but the ambergris at Musc des Sables' heart tinctured from authentic ambre gris (grey amber) through a 6-month process done specifically for Les Indemodables at its founders' lab pulsates with sensuality and complexity. Anyone who's smelled this classical perfume ingredient in its authentic form in vintage or bespoke formulas will recognize it here as the real deal for its earthy, animalic and even tabacco-like warmth that leaves its trace hours into wearing it. Combined with creamy orris, spices, patchouli and musk, Musc des Sables' heady formula somehow maintains a diaphanous yet persistent lightness. Pure magic.","green mandarin, patchouli, ambergris tincture, orris absolute, benzoin, cardamom, cinnamon, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,get combine two costliest ingredients perfumery ambergris orris animalic musks spices antoine lie's hands mysteriously sexy elixir melts skin leaving sheer substantial trace fairy dust that's subtly sweet spicy sensuous ever evolving musc des sables opens fresh bright mandarin note seamlessly transitions cozy spiced opulence ambergris contemporary even luxury perfumes mostly synthetic due price scarcity ambergris musc des sables' heart tinctured authentic ambre gris grey amber month process done specifically les indemodables founders' lab pulsates sensuality complexity anyone who's smelled classical perfume ingredient authentic form vintage bespoke formulas recognize real deal earthy animalic even tabacco like warmth leaves trace hours wearing combined creamy orris spices patchouli musk musc des sables' heady formula somehow maintains diaphanous yet persistent lightness pure magic,"green mandarin, patchouli, ambergris tincture, orris absolute, benzoin, cardamom, cinnamon, musk"
Iris Perle Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"Like some beautiful faces so gorgeous you're not sure what feature to pay attention to first, the elegant Iris Perle is an embarrassment of riches.
Perhaps the first thing you notice is coolness, as if elegance turned itself into silk, shimmering in the light. The multifaceted mimosa bloom, so fresh and representative of that honeyed floral you'd think its scent was radiating from under your nose by the warmth of the sun, combines with sultry jasmine and bright ylang-ylang. Maybe the violet leaves or clary sage that keep the composition fresh catch your attention first, or the huge amount of the most expensive perfume ingredient in the world â orris, the sensual backdrop to Iris Perle that is at once earthy, cool, sensual, and creamy.
Whatever it is you notice first, or all at once, these are not ordinary ingredients. They're the Platonic Ideal, whose journey from plant to bottle was ushered with experience and care by their founders. The Moroccan mimosa absolute in Iris Perle is extracted in their lab from carefully hand-selected flower buds only, whereas the entire flower and stem is usually used in other perfumes with mimosa notes. This accounts for its smooth, rich floralcy that edits out unwanted herbaceous qualities. And from the time it's planted until it's extracted, it takes seven years for orris root to deliver its oil, like a pearl in the world of perfumery. Iris Perle gets its French orris from grand cru crops exclusive to Les Indemodables.
Antoine Lie has wrested from all of these superior ingredients their most singing and luscious qualities, leaving for the dramatic backdrop a kind of textural perfume: rich, buttery, gleaming, and smooth, like an iridescent pearl.","orris absolute, mimosa absolute, jasmine absolute, ylang-ylang, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like beautiful faces gorgeous sure feature pay attention first elegant iris perle embarrassment riches perhaps first thing notice coolness elegance turned silk shimmering light multifaceted mimosa bloom fresh representative honeyed floral think scent radiating nose warmth sun combines sultry jasmine bright ylang ylang maybe violet leaves clary sage keep composition fresh catch attention first huge amount expensive perfume ingredient world orris sensual backdrop iris perle earthy cool sensual creamy whatever notice first ordinary ingredients they're platonic ideal whose journey plant bottle ushered experience care founders moroccan mimosa absolute iris perle extracted lab carefully hand selected flower buds whereas entire flower stem usually used perfumes mimosa notes accounts smooth rich floralcy edits unwanted herbaceous qualities time planted extracted takes seven years orris root deliver oil like pearl world perfumery iris perle gets french orris grand cru crops exclusive les indemodables antoine lie wrested superior ingredients singing luscious qualities leaving dramatic backdrop kind textural perfume rich buttery gleaming smooth like iridescent pearl,"orris absolute, mimosa absolute, jasmine absolute, ylang-ylang, clary sage"
Rose de Jamal Eau de Parfum,Les Indemodables,"Rose de Jamal asks you to rethink this iconic perfume note, long consigned in the mainstream perfume imagination as something stodgy, old fashioned, and too conventionally feminine. And one whiff of it will have you feeling, to borrow a song lyric, like a perfume virgin, sniffing rose as if for the very first time. Its avant-garde construction by perfumer Antoine Lie takes the Moroccan damascena rose absolute at its heart far away from its classical use, thanks largely to its pairing with a special Moroccan Nanehe mint, a variety of spearmint especially sweet and aromatic and used in Moroccan drinks and teas. Although this mint might move Rose de Jamal toward a masculine fougere, it perhaps ideally helps to deconstruct any ingrained ideas of gender in rose, producing only the more perfume-centric thought, This is beautiful.
Rose de Jamal is also unusual for its massive 5.5% dose of Moroccan rose absolute. In addition there are 500 grams of freshly harvested rose buds per bottle of Rose de Jamal â the equivalent of more than 100 roses. Smelling Rose de Jamal might also produce the feeling of smelling rose for the very first time, Lie has suggested in interviews, because its realness is radically different from the scent of synthetically constructed rose accords in most perfumes with rose. The rose here is lush, velvety, almost suede-like, subliminally pulling you into its mysterious heart even as you might only be smelling its lush beauty. What also makes Rose de Jamal special is its name: named after the Les Indemodable exclusive partner in Morocco, Jamal Chaboun, who produces this special Rose harvest (among other ingredients). Jamal owns his plantations, controls the crops, and has mastered extraction processes.
""Jamal loves his business and is very proud of his raw materials,"" Lie said in an interview. ""We decided to make a perfume homage to the gentleman, to take him from the shadows.""","damascene rose absolute, cedarwood, pink pepper c02, naneh mint, lavender",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/827000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rose de jamal asks rethink iconic perfume note long consigned mainstream perfume imagination something stodgy old fashioned conventionally feminine one whiff feeling borrow song lyric like perfume virgin sniffing rose first time avant garde construction perfumer antoine lie takes moroccan damascena rose absolute heart far away classical use thanks largely pairing special moroccan nanehe mint variety spearmint especially sweet aromatic used moroccan drinks teas although mint might move rose de jamal toward masculine fougere perhaps ideally helps deconstruct ingrained ideas gender rose producing perfume centric thought beautiful rose de jamal also unusual massive dose moroccan rose absolute addition grams freshly harvested rose buds per bottle rose de jamal equivalent roses smelling rose de jamal might also produce feeling smelling rose first time lie suggested interviews realness radically different scent synthetically constructed rose accords perfumes rose rose lush velvety almost suede like subliminally pulling mysterious heart even might smelling lush beauty also makes rose de jamal special name named les indemodable exclusive partner morocco jamal chaboun produces special rose harvest among ingredients jamal owns plantations controls crops mastered extraction processes jamal loves business proud raw materials lie said interview decided make perfume homage gentleman take shadows,"damascene rose absolute, cedarwood, pink pepper c02, naneh mint, lavender"

The central player is, we're happy to confirm, the pear- mouthwatering, gently spiced, and sweetened not with syrupy sugar but rather just a touch of ripe banana. Only after we've had some time to exult in this perfect pear does it get the after-dinner treatment- a simmer in rich, warm, boozy brandy and a drizzle of indulgent vanilla cream.

Nefs Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Like Istanbul itself, the masterful creations of Nishane straddle the line between Europe and Asia, synthesizing the palettes and traditions of both in the service of dynamic, modern perfumery. And so it's unsurprising that Nefs, conceptualized as the line's flagship oriental scent, wouldn't be content to simply recycle the genre's standard spicy floral opulence, but would instead strive for a new, modern oriental- an East-meets-West portrait of refined luxury to sway even those who dislike oriental fragrances. Keep in mind that when we say luxurious, we mean it- this is Nishane's most indulgently constructed fragrance yet, with authentic aged oud, exquisite harvests of rose, jasmine, and osmanthus, and a vibrant, saffron-led spice bouquet. Gently sweetened with honey and the balanced booziness of whiskey, the florals and spice stay lively on the skin, subverting any associations of oriental scents with oppressive heaviness or vintage stuffiness.

Mahabah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"Mahaba, meaning 'love' but also 'charity' in Arabic, is a unique floriental composition that conveys youthful innocence and lusty warmth in one breath. A bight candied lemon topnote yields to a startling ylang note that balances its usual impression of fruity, lush tropicalia with an undertone of leathery licorice or rubber. In the background, a sultry combination of vanilla and tonka bean creates a buff, creamy accent, like a bitter almond horchata dusted with candied aniseed sprinkles. Mahaba is gorgeously creamy but never too sweet, with something of the same licorice-and-coffee woodiness that lends Un Bois Vanille (Serge Lutens) its mysterious darkness. Later on, towards the final drydown, a striking note of salt or brine lurking in the wings pops out to create the curious effect of flowers mixed with a creamy, anisic milk and melon rind thickly encrusted with sea salt. Feminine, lovely, and unusual, Mahaba is a floral oriental tailor-made for those moments when you want your scent to convey a certain youthful sweetness but also a little twist that keeps people guessing.","petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mahaba meaning 'love' also 'charity' arabic unique floriental composition conveys youthful innocence lusty warmth one breath bight candied lemon topnote yields startling ylang note balances usual impression fruity lush tropicalia undertone leathery licorice rubber background sultry combination vanilla tonka bean creates buff creamy accent like bitter almond horchata dusted candied aniseed sprinkles mahaba gorgeously creamy never sweet something licorice coffee woodiness lends un bois vanille serge lutens mysterious darkness later towards final drydown striking note salt brine lurking wings pops create curious effect flowers mixed creamy anisic milk melon rind thickly encrusted sea salt feminine lovely unusual mahaba floral oriental tailor made moments want scent convey certain youthful sweetness also little twist keeps people guessing,"petitgrain, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, tonka bean, vanilla"
Shaghaf Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"Shaghaf, meaning passion or sensual desire in Arabic, is, for us, the jewel in the Anfas crown. The simplest way to describe it would be to say that it smells exactly like walking into a centuries-old majlis â a huge, carpeted room for receiving honored guests or conducting parliamentary business âÂ in the heart of a Middle Eastern city. Shaghaf smells like old wood and textiles that have long absorbed the lusty aromas of burning oud wood, the preparation of tea and coffee boiled with cardamom and cloves, and the smoky sweetness of a million assorted grades of bakhoor seeping into hair, wool, and fur, and is now releasing them into the air, with a sigh.
Shaghaf opens with a wave of thrillingly exotic notes, crested by a funky-smoky oud note that's been made even grimier with a lusty ginger and cardamom underlining. The spiced oud accord is like a beastly shadow that creeps along the walls along the Ka'aba, its presence dark and ever-present. But soon, all you notice is the heart of magnificently dry oud wood smoldering in the heat of the embers, peppered with chunks of amber resin and glittering with incense. Slowly, a worn leather note emerges â or maybe it is black tea â thick with a meaty stew of resin and spice. Shaghaf is a very dry but very rich perfume, a microcosm of everything we imagine the Middle East to smell like. But for all its husky desiccation, this is a wonderfully warm and inviting scent. With its toasty, sandy texture, Shaghaf occupies the same headspace as Fidelis (by Histoires de Parfum), Nanban (Arquiste), and Songe d'Un Bois en Ete (Guerlain) but is much softer and smoother, with no harsh woody buzz around the edges. Silage and longevity are as monumental as the scent itself, but Shaghaf is the rare beastmode oriental that actually gets better and more interesting the longer it's on your skin. With the heat of your skin to get it going, the scent seems to expand and radiate off the skin in big, red-gold waves of aroma, undulating in richness and saturation. Color us impressed â this bad boy is a Muezzin's call to prayer in scent form, but there's nothing holy about it.","cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,shaghaf meaning passion sensual desire arabic us jewel anfas crown simplest way describe would say smells exactly like walking centuries old majlis huge carpeted room receiving honored guests conducting parliamentary business heart middle eastern city shaghaf smells like old wood textiles long absorbed lusty aromas burning oud wood preparation tea coffee boiled cardamom cloves smoky sweetness million assorted grades bakhoor seeping hair wool fur releasing air sigh shaghaf opens wave thrillingly exotic notes crested funky smoky oud note that's made even grimier lusty ginger cardamom underlining spiced oud accord like beastly shadow creeps along walls along ka'aba presence dark ever present soon notice heart magnificently dry oud wood smoldering heat embers peppered chunks amber resin glittering incense slowly worn leather note emerges maybe black tea thick meaty stew resin spice shaghaf dry rich perfume microcosm everything imagine middle east smell like husky desiccation wonderfully warm inviting scent toasty sandy texture shaghaf occupies headspace fidelis histoires de parfum nanban arquiste songe d'un bois en ete guerlain much softer smoother harsh woody buzz around edges silage longevity monumental scent shaghaf rare beastmode oriental actually gets better interesting longer skin heat skin get going scent seems expand radiate skin big red gold waves aroma undulating richness saturation color us impressed bad boy muezzin's call prayer scent form there's nothing holy,"cardamom, ginger, citruses, leather, tobacco, cedar, cashmeran, patchouli, agarwood (oud), amber, vanilla, tolu balsam, opoponax"
Red Ishq Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"""I cannot describe the moment your name is mentioned and I cannot express my love for you. You are me, I move with you."" Red ISHQ is perfumer Asim Al Qassim's vision of the yin and yang of true love, the bittersweet sacrifice of submission balanced against the enveloping warmth of unconditional love. Accordingly, the initial burst of leathery saffron â dry, slightly bitter â is softened by a luscious raspberry and a cloud of rosy talc. Think Tuscan Leather's buttery suede jacket dusted with fuchsia-colored powder.
Oakmoss takes the reins in the drydown, its distinctive aroma of dried sea lichen, marine ink, and sea grass giving the scent an interesting salty dryness that nevertheless stays firmly rooted in the leather genre rather than chypre. The drydown of Red ISHQ features a smoky ashy fir balsam note that paints a parallel between the balsamic freshness of Encens Flamboyant (Annick Goutal) and the abstract, crushed-ruby balminess of Baccarat Rouge (Maison Francis Kurkdijan). Despite the pert raspberry note up front, Red ISHQ is completely unisex â a uniquely fresh-but-rich saffron suede with a unami-ish bite that will make your mouth water.","jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cannot describe moment name mentioned cannot express love move red ishq perfumer asim al qassim's vision yin yang true love bittersweet sacrifice submission balanced enveloping warmth unconditional love accordingly initial burst leathery saffron dry slightly bitter softened luscious raspberry cloud rosy talc think tuscan leather's buttery suede jacket dusted fuchsia colored powder oakmoss takes reins drydown distinctive aroma dried sea lichen marine ink sea grass giving scent interesting salty dryness nevertheless stays firmly rooted leather genre rather chypre drydown red ishq features smoky ashy fir balsam note paints parallel balsamic freshness encens flamboyant annick goutal abstract crushed ruby balminess baccarat rouge maison francis kurkdijan despite pert raspberry note front red ishq completely unisex uniquely fresh rich saffron suede unami ish bite make mouth water,"jasmine, saffron, raspberry, amber, oakmoss, talc"
Green Gaya Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"Bright, fresh, and unashamedly cheerful, Green Gaya whisks us on a journey to a true oasis, where its bounty of succulent fruit and spicy woods is all the richer for the vastness of the desert that surrounds it. Picture an exotic dessert, created from the ripest, juiciest fruits a kingdom could produce- sticky, mouthwatering mango and plump, smooth, gently floral pear, enhanced with a daring dose of sweet cardamom and rich star anise. A delectably creamy milk heart heightens the gourmand delicacy, while a balancing accord of crisp, stout cedarwood and a gentle touch of oud cut through the sweet and creamy notes to provide energy and structure. A warm amber base paired with dry iris suggests the stifling heat just outside of our hideaway, heightening the contrast and enhancing the refreshing vitality.","anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bright fresh unashamedly cheerful green gaya whisks us journey true oasis bounty succulent fruit spicy woods richer vastness desert surrounds picture exotic dessert created ripest juiciest fruits kingdom could produce sticky mouthwatering mango plump smooth gently floral pear enhanced daring dose sweet cardamom rich star anise delectably creamy milk heart heightens gourmand delicacy balancing accord crisp stout cedarwood gentle touch oud cut sweet creamy notes provide energy structure warm amber base paired dry iris suggests stifling heat outside hideaway heightening contrast enhancing refreshing vitality,"anise, cardamom, mango, pear, cedar, milk, liquorice, oud, amber, wood, iris"
Purple Sakan,ANFAS,"Purple Sakan is a fragrance dedicated to nostalgia, and to the power that scent has to evoke not only a memory of an event, but of the distinctive emotional and sensory tableau of our most treasured moments. It is a wonder, an impressively spicy oriental that hides impressive complexity behind its subtle and agreeable facade of smooth amber. But as Purple Sakan develops and grows, the vibrance grows by leaps and bounds- earthy, green cardamom leaps from the skin, propelled by bright, dry citrus. Rich, savory coffee and cumin complement the creamy vanilla of the base, while other basenotes of sweet, earthy patchouli and clean musk let the spices continue to sing. Purple Sakan may be a specific reference to the nostalgia of Asim al Qassim's Emirati upbringing and the unique flavors and smells of an Arab kitchen, but the warmth and comfort infused in every drop of this magical elixir is universal.","bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,purple sakan fragrance dedicated nostalgia power scent evoke memory event distinctive emotional sensory tableau treasured moments wonder impressively spicy oriental hides impressive complexity behind subtle agreeable facade smooth amber purple sakan develops grows vibrance grows leaps bounds earthy green cardamom leaps skin propelled bright dry citrus rich savory coffee cumin complement creamy vanilla base basenotes sweet earthy patchouli clean musk let spices continue sing purple sakan may specific reference nostalgia asim al qassim's emirati upbringing unique flavors smells arab kitchen warmth comfort infused every drop magical elixir universal,"bergamot, cardamom, lemon, orange, amber, coffee, cumin, musk, patchouli, vanilla"
Gold Watan Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"""A story written with golden water... a history that cannot be erased...""
Inspired by the feeling of pure luxury conveyed by both pure gold and pure oud, Gold Watan is a shimmering vision of romance and exoticism. From the first spray, its royal lineage is clear, as the top notes feature a rich, resinous, potent oud and cistus combination usually reserved for a scent's latter phases. In this instance, however, it proves the perfect introduction- powerfully evocative, yet so well balanced that the subtly sweet and smoky tones have room to shift and move, leading into an exuberant heart of woodsy, spicy nagarmotha and a smooth, multi-colored floral accord that adds softness to the oud's pungent authenticity. Pillowy musk and the perfect amount of mouthwatering, crystalline sugar complete the intriguingly parallel evolution of the scent, as the progression from rugged to refined happens with such designed subtlety that you may not realize quite what's happened until you find that you simply cannot stop sniffing your wrist. Sumptuous and authentic, yet delicious and delightful, Gold Watan is an unforgettable oud fragrance.","cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,story written golden water history cannot erased inspired feeling pure luxury conveyed pure gold pure oud gold watan shimmering vision romance exoticism first spray royal lineage clear top notes feature rich resinous potent oud cistus combination usually reserved scent's latter phases instance however proves perfect introduction powerfully evocative yet well balanced subtly sweet smoky tones room shift move leading exuberant heart woodsy spicy nagarmotha smooth multi colored floral accord adds softness oud's pungent authenticity pillowy musk perfect amount mouthwatering crystalline sugar complete intriguingly parallel evolution scent progression rugged refined happens designed subtlety may realize quite what's happened find simply cannot stop sniffing wrist sumptuous authentic yet delicious delightful gold watan unforgettable oud fragrance,"cistus, oud, nagarmotha, floral notes, musk, sugar"
Rahaba Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"Rahaba is the Arabic word for openness, especially the openness required of a host. In Arab culture, the role of host is taken very seriously â and Rahaba is a scent that reflects the generosity of spirit required. It opens with a beguiling mixture of fresh and dried pineapple, mimicking the tray of sweetmeats typically offered to you upon arrival. A fizzy lemonade note injects the scent with ferocious sparkle and joie de vivre. There is a touch of gin, too â but it's more a fresh, outdoorsy juniper note than anything truly boozy. This barrage of vibrant, fruity, and fizzy notes are the interlude to a soft and restful bouquet of rose, which, lightly dusted with iris, lends a discreetly powdery texture to the scent. However, like a host who welcomes everyone with equal grace, both men and women alike will find Rahaba tremendously inviting. The bright candied pineapple and floral notes fade away slowly over a blond, freshly-cut woody accord that maintains the scent's sparkling feel. The drydown is curiously airy and salty, a nutty tonka bean holding it all together at the spine. Rahaba is, in its final hours, a melange of tart fruity notes grafted onto a hugely spacious ambery musk â perhaps Ambrox â that expands the scent to room-filling proportions without losing any of its delicacy.","orange, gin, pineapple, damask rose, grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rahaba arabic word openness especially openness required host arab culture role host taken seriously rahaba scent reflects generosity spirit required opens beguiling mixture fresh dried pineapple mimicking tray sweetmeats typically offered upon arrival fizzy lemonade note injects scent ferocious sparkle joie de vivre touch gin fresh outdoorsy juniper note anything truly boozy barrage vibrant fruity fizzy notes interlude soft restful bouquet rose lightly dusted iris lends discreetly powdery texture scent however like host welcomes everyone equal grace men women alike find rahaba tremendously inviting bright candied pineapple floral notes fade away slowly blond freshly cut woody accord maintains scent's sparkling feel drydown curiously airy salty nutty tonka bean holding together spine rahaba final hours melange tart fruity notes grafted onto hugely spacious ambery musk perhaps ambrox expands scent room filling proportions without losing delicacy,"orange, gin, pineapple, damask rose, grasse rose, orris, tonka bean, sandalwood, vanilla, amber, almond, tolu balsam"
Samaha,ANFAS,"Samaha, meaning tolerance and magnanimity in Arabic, is a modern Venus on a Half Shell. Picture a bosomy bouquet of freshly-cut flowers emerging from a fine misting of sea spray, and then wrapped in a cloud of soapy floral musks and the steamy vapors of feminine bathing rituals. Like its antecedents, Amouage Gold or Madame Rochas, Samaha is a classically feminine scent that manages to be refined and faintly suggestive at the same time. Flirting with the line between freshly-scrubbed and richly suggestive, it channels the classic triad of Grasse-grown jasmine, rose, and neroli through the red velvet corridor of a Parisian boudoir. There are no aldehydes here, nothing fusty or old-fashioned, and yet its perfumey cloud of abstract flowers and bathroomy musks clearly draws on a French tradition of perfumery. The key difference is the salty, lemony radiance that suffuses the structure with air and light â Samaha is full-bodied, but light, like the fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake you can imagine.","citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,samaha meaning tolerance magnanimity arabic modern venus half shell picture bosomy bouquet freshly cut flowers emerging fine misting sea spray wrapped cloud soapy floral musks steamy vapors feminine bathing rituals like antecedents amouage gold madame rochas samaha classically feminine scent manages refined faintly suggestive time flirting line freshly scrubbed richly suggestive channels classic triad grasse grown jasmine rose neroli red velvet corridor parisian boudoir aldehydes nothing fusty old fashioned yet perfumey cloud abstract flowers bathroomy musks clearly draws french tradition perfumery key difference salty lemony radiance suffuses structure air light samaha full bodied light like fluffiest floral lemon chiffon cake imagine,"citruses, sea notes, jasmine, neroli, rosebay willowherb, rose, cedar, musk"
Sa'adah Eau de Parfum,ANFAS,"Sa'adah is an Arabic name for girls that means 'happiness'. And indeed, this scent holds true to that inspiration. Opening with a bright, fresh candied orange note over a bed of violets and rose, the scent quickly establishes itself as a mood board of good vibes. Soft but vibrant pine and cedar notes lend the perky florals a touch of woody sourness, keeping the scent on an even keel. We see Sa'adah appealing to young women who like their flowers abstract rather than literal; the bouquet of flowers here is blurred, giving off only an impression of bright, candied freshness, and later on, when a voluptuous ylang enters the picture, a buttery richness. Crucially, though, Sa'adah smells clean and modern, with no aldehydes or powder to 'age' it. It is a happy, bright floral cut free of any association to floral perfumery of the past. A warm, resiny tonka and vanilla base wraps the florals up in a softly caramelized brown sugar haze that, while sweet, won't give anyone toothache. A happy floral for an upbeat sort of gal.","orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/825002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sa'adah arabic name girls means 'happiness' indeed scent holds true inspiration opening bright fresh candied orange note bed violets rose scent quickly establishes mood board good vibes soft vibrant pine cedar notes lend perky florals touch woody sourness keeping scent even keel see sa'adah appealing young women like flowers abstract rather literal bouquet flowers blurred giving impression bright candied freshness later voluptuous ylang enters picture buttery richness crucially though sa'adah smells clean modern aldehydes powder 'age' happy bright floral cut free association floral perfumery past warm resiny tonka vanilla base wraps florals softly caramelized brown sugar haze sweet give anyone toothache happy floral upbeat sort gal,"orange, rose, pine, neroli, violet, cedar, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean"
Velvet Splendour Perfume Concentrate,Goldfield & Banks,"We absolutely adore mimosa-based scents, so when word arrived that the newest Goldfield & Banks would feature golden wattle, or Australian mimosa, we were delighted. But what we never could have anticipated is just how uniquely different from European mimosa golden wattle turns out to be- powdery and woodsy, with gentle tones of green fruit, this is a hearty and distinctive floral note all its own- one that truly captures the rugged beauty of the Flinders Ranges in Southern Australia where the wattle used in this fragrance is harvested. As Goldfield & Banks is so adept at accomplishing, every supplemental ingredient in this cheerfully complex floral brings out a new aspect of the golden wattle- bright, fresh mandarin, smooth orange blossom and jasmine, and soft, gently earthy woods produce a refined naturalism. If you're a mimosa lover looking for something you've never quite tried before, or if you're simply seeking a gorgeous and unique floral perfect for any occasion, Velvet Splendour is ray of warm sunshine.","mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute, orange blossom, jasmin sambac, sandalwood, patchouli, vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,absolutely adore mimosa based scents word arrived newest goldfield banks would feature golden wattle australian mimosa delighted never could anticipated uniquely different european mimosa golden wattle turns powdery woodsy gentle tones green fruit hearty distinctive floral note one truly captures rugged beauty flinders ranges southern australia wattle used fragrance harvested goldfield banks adept accomplishing every supplemental ingredient cheerfully complex floral brings new aspect golden wattle bright fresh mandarin smooth orange blossom jasmine soft gently earthy woods produce refined naturalism mimosa lover looking something never quite tried simply seeking gorgeous unique floral perfect occasion velvet splendour ray warm sunshine,"mandarin, hedione, mimosa absolute, orange blossom, jasmin sambac, sandalwood, patchouli, vetiver, leather, tonka, oppoponax, heliotropine"
Papyrus Oud Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"In 2003, Michel Almairac released the instantly iconic Gucci pour Homme, a boldly warm and woodsy men's scent featuring a proprietary ""papyrus wood"" accord that defied the fresh, synthetic trends of the time to become a modern classic. Now, almost two decades later, Almairac returns to his beloved creation through a niche fragrance lens- with an emphasis on smoky, spicy complexity- and the result is Papyrus Oud, a vision of masculine elegance and warm sophistication.
The key to Papyrus Oud's timeless appeal is evident in the east-meets-west nature of its composition, with classically French floral and aromatic notes of lavender, geranium, oakmoss and jasmine injecting vibrant elegance into the luxuriously Middle Eastern melange of fiery spice, papyrus, agarwood, and incense. The result is a scent that feels full but never heavy, distinctive but smooth and surprisingly easy to wear- a true signature scent that, while leaning masculine, smells out-of-this-world good on just about anyone. Whether you've long missed Gucci pour Homme or are simply looking for something that casts aside the trends of the day for something better, Papyrus Oud is a gift from above.","papyrus, incense, patchouli, oud, musk, chocolate, ginger",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,michel almairac released instantly iconic gucci pour homme boldly warm woodsy men's scent featuring proprietary papyrus wood accord defied fresh synthetic trends time become modern classic almost two decades later almairac returns beloved creation niche fragrance lens emphasis smoky spicy complexity result papyrus oud vision masculine elegance warm sophistication key papyrus oud's timeless appeal evident east meets west nature composition classically french floral aromatic notes lavender geranium oakmoss jasmine injecting vibrant elegance luxuriously middle eastern melange fiery spice papyrus agarwood incense result scent feels full never heavy distinctive smooth surprisingly easy wear true signature scent leaning masculine smells world good anyone whether long missed gucci pour homme simply looking something casts aside trends day something better papyrus oud gift,"papyrus, incense, patchouli, oud, musk, chocolate, ginger"
Gardens of India Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Some fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements of dozens or even hundreds of notes; others, however, know that a simply perfect ratio of a few simply perfect materials has the same capacity to astound. It's this latter philosophy that guides Gardens of India, a deeply romantic scent that deploys three wonderful ingredients- jasmine, tuberose, and sandalwood- to magnificent and unforgettable effect. As basic as the notes list may be, the astonishing balance of Gardens of India is a tribute to the over twenty years that master perfumer Michel Almairac spent refining the formula. It begins with jasmine buds, plucked in June and allowed to hatch before extracting their scent, in order to extract both lush white floral notes and a bright, dewey greenness. Tuberose is harvested in early autumn when the blooms are full, preserving the intense carnality and sweet richness of the majestic flower. Finally, the sandalwood, distilled to rich, woodsy, creamy perfection. The scent is romantic, full-bodied, and invigorating- everything a woodsy floral can and should be. Take a walk through the Gardens of India- we think you'll be surprised at how much you find waiting there.","jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrances achieve sophistication via complex arrangements dozens even hundreds notes others however know simply perfect ratio simply perfect materials capacity astound latter philosophy guides gardens india deeply romantic scent deploys three wonderful ingredients jasmine tuberose sandalwood magnificent unforgettable effect basic notes list may astonishing balance gardens india tribute twenty years master perfumer michel almairac spent refining formula begins jasmine buds plucked june allowed hatch extracting scent order extract lush white floral notes bright dewey greenness tuberose harvested early autumn blooms full preserving intense carnality sweet richness majestic flower finally sandalwood distilled rich woodsy creamy perfection scent romantic full bodied invigorating everything woodsy floral take walk gardens india think surprised much find waiting,"jasmine, tuberose, sandalwood"
Blackpepper Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"Blackpepper is the pitch black of a starless sky rendered into perfume form. A perfect storm of 'black' flavor molecules clash as if in a Super Collider â pungent black pepper, charred cedar, and smoky Akigala wood sparking off against each other and then pulling apart, over and over again. Wearing this scent is like slowly adjusting your eyes to pitch darkness; with time, an incredible wealth of detail is revealed. The fragrance is deep, hot, and oily, but at the same time, it's as dry as a bone. The burnt sugar of tonka bean softens the searing heat of the pepper, like the edge of a cedar log caramelizing on an open fire. A remarkably crisp, airy fragrance emerges phoenix-like from the hot ashes. Fierce enough to command attention, sophisticated enough to leave a lasting impression, Blackpepper is the kind of sexy, modern, avant-garde masterpiece that could only have come from Comme des Garcons.","black pepper, cedar, patchouli, oud, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21646.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,blackpepper pitch black starless sky rendered perfume form perfect storm 'black' flavor molecules clash super collider pungent black pepper charred cedar smoky akigala wood sparking pulling apart wearing scent like slowly adjusting eyes pitch darkness time incredible wealth detail revealed fragrance deep hot oily time dry bone burnt sugar tonka bean softens searing heat pepper like edge cedar log caramelizing open fire remarkably crisp airy fragrance emerges phoenix like hot ashes fierce enough command attention sophisticated enough leave lasting impression blackpepper kind sexy modern avant garde masterpiece could come comme des garcons,"black pepper, cedar, patchouli, oud, tonka bean, musk"

Comme des Garcons: The avant-garde designer that brought her art to the masses. Their first joint fragrance project: As edgy as one might expect. And like Rubchinskiy's clothes, this scent will evoke strong reactions. Inspired by skateboarding on a summer's day in an anonymous Russian city, Gosha Rubchinskiy for Comme des Garcons smells excitingly of lost youth: hot tar mingling with the scent of rubber wheels and the mineral spark of board against concrete. The blackcurrant tang of buchu tea lends a samovar-like flavor to proceedings, briefly flushing the monochromatic palette with rosy tannins.

Concrete Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"The maestros of the unexpected have again tackled a quotidian material and managed to tease apart the surprises that lie within the banal. Comme des Garcons' Concrete is, straightforwardly enough, housed in a grey shell of poured concrete, but uniquely hand-formed. Freed from the streets beneath our feet, concrete becomes a material worthy of observation and appreciation. And the enclosed scent, too, reveals in its first puff what happens when stereotypes are shattered. The first moments of Concrete are shocking â from this weighty concrete pebble, one would expect a harsh industrial scent, but instead, a cloud of soft-focused sherbert, melting in the street, greets the senses. This is Comme des Garcons at its most subtle, honed in on the slightest of details. In the ambiently fruity, lactonic haze, there's a metallic zing, contributed by rose oxide. Lightly spicy, with cinnamon and cardamom, this is a strange, fizzing scent. And as it progresses, the creaminess grows drier. There's an 'aha!' moment when the mind connects the dots, and it becomes discernable as the most velvety of woods â sandalwood. What Comme des Garcons describes as a 'deconstructed' sandalwood, Concrete is a scent that is more than the sum of its parts â identifiable, but still beautifully quixotic in its alignment. The industrial made natural, and nature deconstructed.","cumin, cardamom, clove, rose oxyde, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,maestros unexpected tackled quotidian material managed tease apart surprises lie within banal comme des garcons' concrete straightforwardly enough housed grey shell poured concrete uniquely hand formed freed streets beneath feet concrete becomes material worthy observation appreciation enclosed scent reveals first puff happens stereotypes shattered first moments concrete shocking weighty concrete pebble one would expect harsh industrial scent instead cloud soft focused sherbert melting street greets senses comme des garcons subtle honed slightest details ambiently fruity lactonic haze there's metallic zing contributed rose oxide lightly spicy cinnamon cardamom strange fizzing scent progresses creaminess grows drier there's 'aha ' moment mind connects dots becomes discernable velvety woods sandalwood comme des garcons describes 'deconstructed' sandalwood concrete scent sum parts identifiable still beautifully quixotic alignment industrial made natural nature deconstructed,"cumin, cardamom, clove, rose oxyde, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk"
Andy Warhol's You're In Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"You're In - Say that three times fast, and you can't help but let out an impish laugh. The title of a 1967 artwork by the godfather of Pop Art, Andy Warhol, You're In consisted of Coca-Cola bottles spray-painted his classic silver, and filled with a strange citrus cologne akin to urine (get the pun?) Now reimagined as a chic fragrance by Comme des Garcons, You're In stays true to its avant-garde roots, from the sleek silvery bottle to the zingy, metallic scent within. In a nod to Andy Warhol's multiples, You're In is released as a singular scent but in different unique collectible bottles, inscribed with varying famous quotes by the artist. But the true star here is the fragrance itself - the top notes open in a thirst-quenching burst of bitter orange and zesty makrout lime bubbling atop Comme des Garcons' signature soapy-herbaceous aldehydes. It's a shimmering, scrubbed-clean kind of sophisticated, and completed with pittosporum, a hyper-concentrated twin of orange blossom, and a softening hint of jasmine. Like a cold splash of water from a technicolor fountain, Andy Warhol's You're In leaves a mark as iconic as old Andy himself.

Odeur 53 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"Mission: a scent that nobody recognized. Abstract. Lack of a been there, done that snooze-fest.In 1998, CdG stepped away from natural ingredients, seeking to clone the ultra-modern straight outta the manmade world. The result? Fifty three non-traditional notes comprise this masterpiece, resulting in a very recognizable scent of crisp air mixing with cotton-drying-in-the-wind. We think it smells like a brand-new car and warm, soft human skin-perfection. You may think it sounds strange until you realize just how many of the notes of Odeur 53 you know (and love).

CdG 2 MAN is a revision of the original 2 (in the silver bottle), taking it in a more woody/incense direction and creating a whole new animal. Smoldering at first, 2 MAN roars out of the gate, declaring its boldness and contempt for simpering little focus-group scents that are a mishmash of ""manly"" notes. 2 MAN's simmering and incensey opening unfolds into an unusual combination of nutmeg, vetiver and subtle saffron flowers, each one appearing like chapters in a book.

3 Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"What would a flower that didn't exist smell like? CdG3 was borne from a dream by its creator, in which an electric, incandescent flower shines out of a primordial, lava-filled nothingness. Completely living up to that Sci-Fi inspired dream, CdG3 is a fragrantly opalescent rendering of what it would be like to find a never before seen or imagined flower growing on another planet. By turns bold and elusive, energetic and bewitching, the top and middle notes of black rose oxide, mace, angelica and basil spring up from the earthier base notes of cedar, birch and sandalwood, drying down to a fresh, mysterious, powdery greenness.

Wonderwood Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"After several collaborative projects, Comme des Garcons launches a purely Comme des Garcons scent. A positive overdose of woods, woody notes and synthetic wood constructions (Wood gone mad). And it has.
Wood, of course, has been part of the Comme des Garcons Parfums DNA from the outset, and here perfumer Antoine Lie has pulled out all the stops: this is all wood, just like it says on the bottle, the notes melding through the common smokiness of incense, guaiac, sandalwood, vetiver and oud with a hint of musty patchouli, dried out by cypress and cedar, wrapped in the powdery, velvety muskiness of Cashmeran. This sensuous ode to woodiness, translated into an eerie gorgeous visual rhapsody by the Quay Brothers, may just be the most quintessentially CdG fragrance since its first, groundbreaking offering by Mark Buxton in 1994, Comme des Garcons Eau de Parfum. It is wood made liquid and smoke and take our word, like the man who loved woods more than any words could say in the video, you'll want to drown in it.

Amazingreen Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"In an interview to a French magazine, the perfumer Jean-Christophe Herault admitted to a twin obsession with the sap-filled scent of lentiscus and the smell of freshly renovated old houses. Somehow this blend of green and mineral must have inspired Amazingreen. Or did he take his cue from the flint and smoke facets of vetiver?
This 'blast of green energy' from Comme des Garcons starts out cool as a tropical shower from bouncing shiny leaves the size of umbrellas. Moves on to a slightly sulfurous gunpowder accord (think of how the air smells after fireworks) as guerillas skulk through the undergrowth. Is that something burning? The ice-cold sear of green pepper on the tongue, the wisps of smoke of a campfire in a secret clearing...
Tough and lush, exuberant but slightly dangerous, the vegetal and mineral elements unfurl their various facets side by side. Trouble's clearly brewing in the jungle.","palm tree leaves, green pepper, dew mist, jungle leaves, ivy leaves, orris roots, coriander seeds, silex, gunpowder accord, vetiver, smoke, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21628.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,interview french magazine perfumer jean christophe herault admitted twin obsession sap filled scent lentiscus smell freshly renovated old houses somehow blend green mineral must inspired amazingreen take cue flint smoke facets vetiver 'blast green energy' comme des garcons starts cool tropical shower bouncing shiny leaves size umbrellas moves slightly sulfurous gunpowder accord think air smells fireworks guerillas skulk undergrowth something burning ice cold sear green pepper tongue wisps smoke campfire secret clearing tough lush exuberant slightly dangerous vegetal mineral elements unfurl various facets side side trouble's clearly brewing jungle,"palm tree leaves, green pepper, dew mist, jungle leaves, ivy leaves, orris roots, coriander seeds, silex, gunpowder accord, vetiver, smoke, white musk"
Black Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"Black is many things. One of those things is a positive number on a balance sheet, the opposite of red. That may be the thinking behind BLACK, Comme des Garcons' fragrance started in 2009. In response to the general negativity engendered by the recession and to counter the feeling of things being blocked or stopped because of the crisis.
Four years later, the brand marks the concepts anniversary through the launch of BLACK Eau de Toilette, an emergency, guerrilla-like, spiced-up new scent, which Rei Kawakubo, never one to shy away from literalism, has infused with Madagascar black pepper and Somalian incense, with essences of leather, licorice, birch tar and pepperwood. The result? A swoon-inducing trip into the smokey, spiritual world of incense, touched by the solar warmth of pepper and cedar wood. The licorice note adds a touch of cleansing 'eternalness' and, at times, feels uplifting. And in the end, we're left in a dizzying spell of delight. Dark and mysterious, yet ultimately calm and reassuring.","cedarwood, vetiver, leather, liquorice, birch tar, pepperwood, black pepper, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21631.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,black many things one things positive number balance sheet opposite red may thinking behind black comme des garcons' fragrance started response general negativity engendered recession counter feeling things blocked stopped crisis four years later brand marks concepts anniversary launch black eau de toilette emergency guerrilla like spiced new scent rei kawakubo never one shy away literalism infused madagascar black pepper somalian incense essences leather licorice birch tar pepperwood result swoon inducing trip smokey spiritual world incense touched solar warmth pepper cedar wood licorice note adds touch cleansing 'eternalness' times feels uplifting end we're left dizzying spell delight dark mysterious yet ultimately calm reassuring,"cedarwood, vetiver, leather, liquorice, birch tar, pepperwood, black pepper, incense"

Serpentine Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons,"""The Grass, The Trees, The Lake, And You..."" The British artist Tracey Emin scrawled the words on the bottle. She also draw a couple embracing for the box, based on a sculpture she bought in Paris for her 50th birthday.
The scent was designed by Christian Astuguevieille with Emilie Coppermann on the occasion of the Serpentine Galleries' expanded presence in the Royal Park of Kensington Gardens with the new Serpentine Sackler Gallery, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects. And of course, this being Comme des Garcons, it conjures not only the bucolic fragrances of Hyde Park (that's the 'grass, trees and lake' part) but a hefty whiff of London. What other brand would be loony enough to claim asphalt and 'a little bit of pollution' in its notes list? As unabashedly avant-garde as the venue it was created for, Serpentine's depiction of Nature in the City joins the groundbreaking Odeurs (53 and 71) and the cult Synthetics series in celebrating the evocative powers and bracing beauty of urban smells. You'll be wearing a piece of contemporary art.","grass, leaves, pollen (galbanum, iris leaf), oxygen (aldehyde, ozone), asphalt (black musk, nutmeg), labdanum, smoked cedar (benzoin, juniper wood, guaiac wood), pollution",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21638.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,grass trees lake british artist tracey emin scrawled words bottle also draw couple embracing box based sculpture bought paris th birthday scent designed christian astuguevieille emilie coppermann occasion serpentine galleries' expanded presence royal park kensington gardens new serpentine sackler gallery designed zaha hadid architects course comme des garcons conjures bucolic fragrances hyde park that's 'grass trees lake' part hefty whiff london brand would loony enough claim asphalt 'a little bit pollution' notes list unabashedly avant garde venue created serpentine's depiction nature city joins groundbreaking odeurs cult synthetics series celebrating evocative powers bracing beauty urban smells wearing piece contemporary art,"grass, leaves, pollen (galbanum, iris leaf), oxygen (aldehyde, ozone), asphalt (black musk, nutmeg), labdanum, smoked cedar (benzoin, juniper wood, guaiac wood), pollution"
Floriental Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"Even if you were unfamiliar with the term, you'd know a 'floriental' when you smelled it- this fragrance family combining floral notes with the dark woods, spices and resins that distinguish orientals are so popular as to be nearly ubiquitous. But with Comme des Garcons, there's always a twist, and so Floriental, the newest fragrance from the avant garde Japanese/French fashion stalwart, has chosen as its floral of note the Cistus flower- a flower without a scent. And so, CDG's Floriental is a postmodern floral, one where the sweet, lush, peppery aspects of flowers are created from plum, pink pepper, and sandalwood, and where labdanum- the rich resin that's the true fragrant bounty of the cistus bush- forms the basis of the oriental notes for a floral oriental both innovative and yet true in spirit. And in the modern, mischievous style of Comme des Garcons, Floriental is even nontraditional in structure- without classically defined top, heart and base notes, the fragrance evolves in unpredictable waves, trading off between lush fruitiness, resinous woods and fiery spice with delightful frequency, resulting in a scent that wears differently each time. At once layered and unstructured, simple and modern, masculine and feminine, Floriental is a landscape of wonderful contradiction, with a single exception- it's 100% CDG.","pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21643.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,even unfamiliar term know 'floriental' smelled fragrance family combining floral notes dark woods spices resins distinguish orientals popular nearly ubiquitous comme des garcons there's always twist floriental newest fragrance avant garde japanese/french fashion stalwart chosen floral note cistus flower flower without scent cdg's floriental postmodern floral one sweet lush peppery aspects flowers created plum pink pepper sandalwood labdanum rich resin that's true fragrant bounty cistus bush forms basis oriental notes floral oriental innovative yet true spirit modern mischievous style comme des garcons floriental even nontraditional structure without classically defined top heart base notes fragrance evolves unpredictable waves trading lush fruitiness resinous woods fiery spice delightful frequency resulting scent wears differently time layered unstructured simple modern masculine feminine floriental landscape wonderful contradiction single exception cdg,"pink pepper, plum, incense, labdanum, sandalwood, vetiver"
Dot Eau de Parfum,Comme des Garcons,"The deceptive simplicity and industrial whimsy that define the Comme des Garcons aesthetic has always proven to be a remarkably versatile template for all types of fragrances. Dot, the newest release from the venerable house, demonstrates this with great aplomb: a fresh, fruity floral with wonderfully unique touches of resin and green notes, Dot is both lusciously feminine, but also distinctly CDG. Inspired not only by the smell of the Osmanthus flower but equally by the mysterious allure of a park filled with Osmanthus trees in bloom, Dot is more tone-poem than standard soliflore. The scent radiates with floral smoothness, but also with the fruity tonalities that emanates from the blossoms, the radiant green notes that illustrate the leaves, and white ambery woods that reflect the bark of the tree. Resinous olibanum gives the distinct character of a park set within a bustling cityscape, and pepper oil further enhances the balsamic, spicy aspect of the incense. The result is just as pretty as one could hope for, but with the distinctive character of another wonderfully modern Comme des Garcons creation. Like the titular white dots on the eye-catching flacon, Dot is sure to make you stand out from the crowd.","osmanthus, fruits, green notes, amberwood, olibanum, pepper, bitter orange",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21644.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,deceptive simplicity industrial whimsy define comme des garcons aesthetic always proven remarkably versatile template types fragrances dot newest release venerable house demonstrates great aplomb fresh fruity floral wonderfully unique touches resin green notes dot lusciously feminine also distinctly cdg inspired smell osmanthus flower equally mysterious allure park filled osmanthus trees bloom dot tone poem standard soliflore scent radiates floral smoothness also fruity tonalities emanates blossoms radiant green notes illustrate leaves white ambery woods reflect bark tree resinous olibanum gives distinct character park set within bustling cityscape pepper oil enhances balsamic spicy aspect incense result pretty one could hope distinctive character another wonderfully modern comme des garcons creation like titular white dots eye catching flacon dot sure make stand crowd,"osmanthus, fruits, green notes, amberwood, olibanum, pepper, bitter orange"

Lustre Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes,"Imagine the sun rising over seemingly endless fields of roses in the heartland of Bulgaria. Lovers of rose know that given the infinite complexity inherent to the flower, a true rose soliflore may be anything except predictably simple. It is in this wondrous spirit that Hiram Green delivers Lustre, a celebration of the exquisite Bulgarian rose that combines everything we love about rose with everything we love about Hiram Green. To put it another way, Lustre is a vivacious, joyful, sun-drenched rose scent with an abundance of both naturalism and sophistication. This is unmistakably Bulgarian rose, so lush and fresh that you can feel the soft flesh of pink petals between your fingers, with citrus to maximize its sparkling brightness, creamy orris to round out the lush floral profile, and just a dab of olibanum for richness and longevity and to complement the rose's natural honeyed sweetness. A near perfect Bulgarian rose soliflore, Lustre is a new triumph for one of niche perfume's most meteoric rising stars.","rose, citrus, orris, olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,imagine sun rising seemingly endless fields roses heartland bulgaria lovers rose know given infinite complexity inherent flower true rose soliflore may anything except predictably simple wondrous spirit hiram green delivers lustre celebration exquisite bulgarian rose combines everything love rose everything love hiram green put another way lustre vivacious joyful sun drenched rose scent abundance naturalism sophistication unmistakably bulgarian rose lush fresh feel soft flesh pink petals fingers citrus maximize sparkling brightness creamy orris round lush floral profile dab olibanum richness longevity complement rose's natural honeyed sweetness near perfect bulgarian rose soliflore lustre new triumph one niche perfume's meteoric rising stars,"rose, citrus, orris, olibanum"
L'Eau de Reims,Reims Parfums,"L'Eau de Reims smells very French. Primarily an essay on the fresh, celery-like greenness of petitgrain and neroli, Duchaufour twists things in a slightly chypre direction with a generous lick of salty, dark green oakmoss. Even more delightfully, proceedings open here with a volley of bitter, lemony eau de cologne-style notes that last just long enough to jolt its wearer awake. The real star of L'Eau de Reims, however, is that remarkable petitgrain-neroli accord. Although neroli is not listed, we're sure we smell its modulating influence here, softening the lemony sharpness of the petitgrain with its characteristic soapy freshness and its lingering vegetal notes. A hint of geranium emphasizes the spicy, leafy greenness of the neroli. Oakmoss provides structure to the drydown, supporting the freshness of the petitgrain-neroli heart with a robust, salty minerality that never strays into dankness. We think L'Eau de Reims is a real tour de force for summer wear â as fresh and clean as a traditional eau de cologne, yet with the salty heft of a properly French chypre base. A new classic in the making? We think so.","petitgrain, neroli, incense, geranium, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,l'eau de reims smells french primarily essay fresh celery like greenness petitgrain neroli duchaufour twists things slightly chypre direction generous lick salty dark green oakmoss even delightfully proceedings open volley bitter lemony eau de cologne style notes last long enough jolt wearer awake real star l'eau de reims however remarkable petitgrain neroli accord although neroli listed we're sure smell modulating influence softening lemony sharpness petitgrain characteristic soapy freshness lingering vegetal notes hint geranium emphasizes spicy leafy greenness neroli oakmoss provides structure drydown supporting freshness petitgrain neroli heart robust salty minerality never strays dankness think l'eau de reims real tour de force summer wear fresh clean traditional eau de cologne yet salty heft properly french chypre base new classic making think,"petitgrain, neroli, incense, geranium, oakmoss"
Haute Provence Eau de Cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"While wild lavender abounds throughout the countryside of Provence, master perfumers know that ""true lavender, "" that which only grows at an altitude above 1200 meters, has no substitute- boasting both fresher, more camphorous tones and a sweeter, richer, warmer tone as it dries, it's a superior material in every way to its common counterpart. So it's no surprise that Mme. Patricia de Nicolai, perhaps the greatest living inheritor of the grand legacy of vintage French perfumery, accepts nothing less than Haute Provence lavender in her fragrances, and believes in its value as an ingredient so much that she presents it here, with minimal embellishment, as an eau de cologne- and the results are impressive. If anything, the openness of an EDC lets the star ingredient shine, delivering intensely sharp, bright freshness up top, complemented with spicy, citric petitgrain, and then drying to a smooth, creamy iris-paired musky woodsiness that lingers with just the right amount of unassuming confidence on the skin. A classic eau de cologne is a vivid, fresh sensory experience meant to strip away the levels of artifice between fragrance and nature. By those standards, Haute Provence is an unmistakable gem.","petitgrain, bergamot, lavender, iris, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31359.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,wild lavender abounds throughout countryside provence master perfumers know true lavender grows altitude meters substitute boasting fresher camphorous tones sweeter richer warmer tone dries superior material every way common counterpart surprise mme patricia de nicolai perhaps greatest living inheritor grand legacy vintage french perfumery accepts nothing less haute provence lavender fragrances believes value ingredient much presents minimal embellishment eau de cologne results impressive anything openness edc lets star ingredient shine delivering intensely sharp bright freshness top complemented spicy citric petitgrain drying smooth creamy iris paired musky woodsiness lingers right amount unassuming confidence skin classic eau de cologne vivid fresh sensory experience meant strip away levels artifice fragrance nature standards haute provence unmistakable gem,"petitgrain, bergamot, lavender, iris, musk, cedar"
Hossegor Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"""You walk through woods wet with spray and alive. Your fingertips, the tendrils of a fern, reach into the deep foliage, dissolve into the infinite. Why do you travel to where the sun shakes your hand? What good is devotion if it cannot combine body, land, sea, sky into equal parts loneliness and love? Lie down and rest here. And be made whole.""
This is the pitch behind Hossegor, one of the most original and compelling oceanic scents we've experienced in quite some time. Inspired by the resort town deep in the south of France, an unforgettable pairing of beachside surfer's paradise and a lush marine lake, Hossegor the scent delivers a bracing, invigorating, and ultimately deeply soothing combination of mineral, herbaceous, woodsy, and aromatic notes that tap into a near-primal sense of sublimity. From a compellingly spicy, green, and herbaceous opening of fiery black pepper and resinous mastic to a rich aromatic heart of sage and oceanic sea salt, every note feels powerful yet balanced, naturalistic yet stylish, and glowing with the tempered warmth of the glowing sun setting over the rapidly cooling, tree-lined lakeside. A Lab On Fire has chased the sun everywhere from Ipanema to the South Pacific, but with Hossegor, they may have found their best destination yet.","juniper, mastic, black pepper, sea salt, clary sage, orris root, olibanum, solar accord, ambergris, vetiver, mineral musk, wet woods, ambrox, sea moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,walk woods wet spray alive fingertips tendrils fern reach deep foliage dissolve infinite travel sun shakes hand good devotion cannot combine body land sea sky equal parts loneliness love lie rest made whole pitch behind hossegor one original compelling oceanic scents we've experienced quite time inspired resort town deep south france unforgettable pairing beachside surfer's paradise lush marine lake hossegor scent delivers bracing invigorating ultimately deeply soothing combination mineral herbaceous woodsy aromatic notes tap near primal sense sublimity compellingly spicy green herbaceous opening fiery black pepper resinous mastic rich aromatic heart sage oceanic sea salt every note feels powerful yet balanced naturalistic yet stylish glowing tempered warmth glowing sun setting rapidly cooling tree lined lakeside lab fire chased sun everywhere ipanema south pacific hossegor may found best destination yet,"juniper, mastic, black pepper, sea salt, clary sage, orris root, olibanum, solar accord, ambergris, vetiver, mineral musk, wet woods, ambrox, sea moss"
Ani Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"An ancient metropolis now abandoned to the ages, Ani and its many ruined churches now stand as a monument to the both the majesty of empire and the inevitability of time. To honor this mystical place and capture its unique evolution, Nishane has created a fragrance that juxtaposes bright freshness, fiery spice, rugged woods, and rich warmth- a true voyage through the ages. Ani opens with a bright, bracingly fresh and green bergamot- overflowing with juicy citrus and the snap of fresh vegetation, evoking the overgrowth that has retaken the crumbled walls. A blazing wash of gingery spice suggests the life that still remains, while a gorgeous, fruity rose peeks from between ancient stone. We feel the power of history, now, as rich, creamy, resinous vanilla and rich, earthy wood echo with multitude of voices now left to history. Complex, robust, and vibrant, Ani is a fragrance with true heritage to its name.","bergamot, green notes, blue ginger, pink pepper, blackcurrant, rose, cardamom, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, benzoin, ambergris, musk, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774052.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ancient metropolis abandoned ages ani many ruined churches stand monument majesty empire inevitability time honor mystical place capture unique evolution nishane created fragrance juxtaposes bright freshness fiery spice rugged woods rich warmth true voyage ages ani opens bright bracingly fresh green bergamot overflowing juicy citrus snap fresh vegetation evoking overgrowth retaken crumbled walls blazing wash gingery spice suggests life still remains gorgeous fruity rose peeks ancient stone feel power history rich creamy resinous vanilla rich earthy wood echo multitude voices left history complex robust vibrant ani fragrance true heritage name,"bergamot, green notes, blue ginger, pink pepper, blackcurrant, rose, cardamom, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, benzoin, ambergris, musk, sandalwood"
Unutamam Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"As the first entry in Nishane's bold new ""Experimental Collection,"" Unutamam was bound to defy easy categorization. But that turns out to be the point: as conceived by Nishane and star fragrance blogger and creator Miguel Matos, Unutamam (the name of a famous Turkish song) intentionally straddles the line between lush seduction and animalic ferocity, leaving it to the wearer to decide which mood to allow the scent to embody. Unutamam, from first spray, is an intense experience: a whip's lash of lacerating aromatics and florals, defying any attempt at a complacent reaction. Even as the florals grow smoother and lusher, a smoky, industrial undertone grows, with patchouli, labdanum, and castoreum approximating the animalic thrum of petroleum, the rough protection of military-grade leather. Or perhaps your journey into this intriguing and dynamic fragrance takes you in the other direction, to a garden of herbaceous delight and sweet, smooth caramelized amber. After all, the choice is entirely yours- and what an accomplishment that is.","lavender, rosemary, mint, juniper, jasmine, carnation, patchouli, amber, oregano, castoreum, cistus, oakmoss, caramel",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/774053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first entry nishane's bold new experimental collection unutamam bound defy easy categorization turns point conceived nishane star fragrance blogger creator miguel matos unutamam name famous turkish song intentionally straddles line lush seduction animalic ferocity leaving wearer decide mood allow scent embody unutamam first spray intense experience whip's lash lacerating aromatics florals defying attempt complacent reaction even florals grow smoother lusher smoky industrial undertone grows patchouli labdanum castoreum approximating animalic thrum petroleum rough protection military grade leather perhaps journey intriguing dynamic fragrance takes direction garden herbaceous delight sweet smooth caramelized amber choice entirely accomplishment,"lavender, rosemary, mint, juniper, jasmine, carnation, patchouli, amber, oregano, castoreum, cistus, oakmoss, caramel"
Milano Cento For Him Eau de Toilette,Milano Cento,"A bona fide 1980's cult classic, Milano Cento was born in an era of cultural futurism and modernist design, but with an eye towards the classics. Now, nearly 40 years later, it's never been more compelling. Inspired by the wonderfully diverse, aromatic plants of Italy, Milano Cento Him opens with zesty, sparkling notes of lemon, bergamot and green petitgrain. Herbaceous notes of lavender and rosemary combine with the intensity of basil and clary sage, followed by rich, sensual sandalwood and patchouli. Spicy clove, cinnamon, amber and warm musks live in the memory and in the heart.

Douce Amere Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Devilishly bitter, then divinely sweet âÂ this eccentric brew is a bundle of contradictions from the moment it touches your skin. The absinthe is cool and the cinnamon is hot. The flowers are ethereal and the wood is strong. The licorice is sharp and the powder is soft and it all melds together in an indescribable way that will having you sneaking off to sniff your arm again and again. Moody and contrary, this is the unexpected lightness of heart at the sight of a gray, rainy day; the decadent thrill of reveling in a bad mood overlong; the sharp stab of melancholy when you hear of someone else being happy. This is dark and troubled and enigmatic, even through the sweetest parts, and at the heart of it all is the aromatic Artemisia absinthum, almost medicinal at first but becoming a warm and glowing narcotic presence as the elixir develops. Edgy and fiendishly attractive, this is the perfect scent to wear when you are looking for trouble. Actually, if you wear it, trouble will probably find you first.","absinthe (artemisia absinthum) , cinnamon, anise, lily, jasmine, tiare, tagette, marigold, musk, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,devilishly bitter divinely sweet eccentric brew bundle contradictions moment touches skin absinthe cool cinnamon hot flowers ethereal wood strong licorice sharp powder soft melds together indescribable way sneaking sniff arm moody contrary unexpected lightness heart sight gray rainy day decadent thrill reveling bad mood overlong sharp stab melancholy hear someone else happy dark troubled enigmatic even sweetest parts heart aromatic artemisia absinthum almost medicinal first becoming warm glowing narcotic presence elixir develops edgy fiendishly attractive perfect scent wear looking trouble actually wear trouble probably find first,"absinthe (artemisia absinthum) , cinnamon, anise, lily, jasmine, tiare, tagette, marigold, musk, cedar"
Rahat Loukhoum Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Not truly loukhoum, with its rosy gelatin texture, but rather freshly baked pasticche di mandrel, those bone-white, chewy little almond cookies sold everywhere in Rome. If you've ever tried them, then you'll know that they are not as tooth-achingly sweet as they appear, the bitterness of cherry pit cutting through the thick dusting of confectioner's sugar. It's that balance of bitter and sweet that makes you dip greedily into the bag again and again.
And so it is with Rahat Loukoum. The sweet honey, almonds, and creamy vanilla are glossed with just enough bitter cherries, hawthorn, and balsams to stop you from putting your wrist in your mouth. The base, surprisingly resinous, exerts firm control over the sweet, fluffy heliotrope, and walks the fragrance straight down the line of edible-inedible. Rahat Loukoum is that rare scent is that is far from your average gourmand-- though with Serge Lutens' pedigree, we're guessing you already knew that.

Iris Silver Mist Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"More iris, more, more, more, Serge Lutens famously urged Maurice Roucel when he was composing Iris Silver Mist. Legend has it that poor Maurice went back to the lab and, in his desperation, threw every known iris material into the formula, including a little-used iris nitrile called Irival. What emerged chrysalis-like from this chaotic lab experiment was a wonder of nature and a work of art.
Iris Silver Mist smells entirely like a root freshly torn from the ground, caked with earth, dew, and ice. Its purity is lung-filling and green - as bracing as cold water running in a brook. Between the iced, milky roots of the topnotes and the cool musk in the base, clove and benzoin lend the texture a spicy, dusty feel that almost approaches human warmth. But make no mistake âÂ Iris Silver Mist is as brutally pure as a block of ice melting slowly in a forest on the Russian Steppes. As close to wearing a piece of art as you're likely to get.

Bois Et Musc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Ahh, Bois et Musc! We have a particular fondness for this unfairly overlooked gem in the Lutens Bois series, which wears like a sunset in smudgy golds and pinks. Bois et Musc is a soft, rosy cedarwood diffused out into a cloud of musk and sweetened with a judicious touch of spice (the notes say saffron, but we also smell a gentle nutmeg, cinnamon, and perhaps even a smattering of cumin). Far woodier and less syrupy-fruity than its siblings in the Bois series â Bois de Violette and Bois et Fruits â Bois et Muscs may actually be closer in spirit to the original Shiseido Feminite du Bois than the current Serge Lutens version. More than scent, however, Bois et Musc is all about texture: its musk is velvety and beeswaxy, while its cedarwood is silky. Not as dirty as Muscs Khoublai Khan but not nearly as clean as Clair de Musc, Bois et Musc is, for us, the happy medium of Lutensian musks. It is sensual as hell but in that comfortably discreet way that makes people wonder if you're wearing perfume or just smell particularly good. And when you're wearing Bois et Musc, you most certainly do.

Sarrasins Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Rich yet airy and 'clear', Sarrasins is the sheer silk shawl to La Nuit's dense buttercream satin. Famously alluring, this scent derives its charm from the juxtaposition of innocence and sensuality. Though the opening is a burst of crystalline jasmine sharpened with a needlepoint of camphor and other mysterious greenery (privet hedge? mint?), its freshness is immediately counterpoised by a smudge of inky indole. Sarrasins is very elegant and very French - a rudely botanical hothouse flower styled and teased up into a chignon. In the heart, hints of hay and tea give the jasmine a transparency it does not possess in real life. The dry clove-like spiciness of carnation is framed against the crispness of green apples and grapes taken straight from the chiller. Beneath this impression of freshness, however, a sultry osmanthus and castoreum slyly join forces to create a dark, dry apricot leather that smells like skin at the nape of the neck. Sarrasins' je ne sais quoi emanates from this contrast between a living flower tumbling off a vine and the soft, skin-like suede notes that give it an abstract sophistication. Wear Sarrasins to feel inimitably French.

Winter Palace Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"A stunning fantasia of fiery resins and smooth tea, Winter Palace is a mythological vision of China where dragons soar and intrigue lurks behind every gate. We're swept away from the opening burst of rich, oily, tea-infused citrus- miles from both the salty freshness of a Mediterranean citrus scent or the sunny sweetness of a California one- balanced against robust, gently toasty mate. The exotic richness only deepens from here, as the distinctive red tea heart, earthy and subtly tart, takes on richer, more resinous character with a cascade of balsamic woods, as awe-inspiring and powerful as the serpentine form of a Chinese dragon undulating along the hill-studded landscape like a Great Wall in motion. As a deep, warm, vanilla-rich amber emerges in the base, we feel the true power of the scent, compelling and unique, imbued with ancient sophistication but glowing with vibrant potency.

Constructed around the unique nature of white peaches, which are sweeter, more floral and less tart than their more common yellow counterparts, White Peaches serves up a delectably ripe peach note, juicy and cool on its own, but made positively thirst-quenching with the addition of an ""iced"" elderflower note, distinctively chilly and wonderfully fresh. A base of silver birch transposes its normally Christmas-y wintergreen aroma to this warm-weather cocktail, revealing another layer of revitalizing crispness.

Eau de Minthe Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"Invented in 1882 with the release of Houbigant's Fougere Royale, the distinctively fresh, classically masculine fougere is a stalwart of fine European fragrance- and until now, there's never been an entry from the equally iconic house of Diptyque. But in case you haven't figured it out from the name, Eau de Minthe is not your (great-great-?) grandfather's fougere; rather, it's an impressively clever twist on a classic that replaces the standard lavender-geranium-oakmoss DNA of a fougere with an electric jolt of mouthwatering mint in place of the lavender. Not only does this provide a striking unisex balance to a typically masculine genre, but it builds on a molecular connection between mint and geranium that lends the floral heart of the scent a dynamic aromatic resonance. As a soft patchouli base with a touch of mossy rose lends gentle strength, Eau de Minthe takes the form of a recognizable fougere- but never so much that its delightful individuality is lost. Vibrant, fresh, and utterly unique, Eau de Minthe is a new classic fougere to stand alongside the greats.","mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,invented release houbigant's fougere royale distinctively fresh classically masculine fougere stalwart fine european fragrance there's never entry equally iconic house diptyque case figured name eau de minthe great great grandfather's fougere rather impressively clever twist classic replaces standard lavender geranium oakmoss dna fougere electric jolt mouthwatering mint place lavender provide striking unisex balance typically masculine genre builds molecular connection mint geranium lends floral heart scent dynamic aromatic resonance soft patchouli base touch mossy rose lends gentle strength eau de minthe takes form recognizable fougere never much delightful individuality lost vibrant fresh utterly unique eau de minthe new classic fougere stand alongside greats,"mint, geranium, patchouli, rose oxide"
Splendiris Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"With the tremendous visual and olfactory beauty of the iris comes a unique challenge- how does one create an iris scent that improves upon what nature has already perfected? In the case of the truly magical newest release from Dusita, the answer lies in the subtleties- Splendiris showcases an utterly breathtaking orris absolute in all of its cool, purple, rich, and powdered glory, with just the right amount of fresh, dark, and gourmand supplemental notes to modernize, brighten, and smooth the whole experience into the realm of the sublime.
Splendiris opens with a burst of juicy citrus and lively, gently aromatic green notes that feel fresh and contemporary, wiping clean your preconceptions about what an iris scent can be. As the richly floral heart emerges, we swoon over the elegance and richness of the orris butter, but further exploration reveals Splendiris to be much more than a single expensive ingredient- here, the natural rooty, powdery sophistication of iris is sweetened with violet and fig and given luscious texture with rose and jasmine to create a true bouquet. A perfect dollop of luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver and cedar enriches further, creating a rare fragrant plateau where sensuality, style, and naturalism share top billing. In other words, Splendiris is objectively an iris soliflore- but if all you smell is the iris, you're not paying attention to the dozens of brilliant combinations that make for the most gorgeously idealized iris you've ever experienced. While we've grown to expect world-class scents with each new Dusita release, Splendiris is, even by those standards, in a class of its own.","bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tremendous visual olfactory beauty iris comes unique challenge one create iris scent improves upon nature already perfected case truly magical newest release dusita answer lies subtleties splendiris showcases utterly breathtaking orris absolute cool purple rich powdered glory right amount fresh dark gourmand supplemental notes modernize brighten smooth whole experience realm sublime splendiris opens burst juicy citrus lively gently aromatic green notes feel fresh contemporary wiping clean preconceptions iris scent richly floral heart emerges swoon elegance richness orris butter exploration reveals splendiris much single expensive ingredient natural rooty powdery sophistication iris sweetened violet fig given luscious texture rose jasmine create true bouquet perfect dollop luxuriously creamy vanilla alongside woodsy vetiver cedar enriches creating rare fragrant plateau sensuality style naturalism share top billing words splendiris objectively iris soliflore smell iris paying attention dozens brilliant combinations make gorgeously idealized iris ever experienced we've grown expect world class scents new dusita release splendiris even standards class,"bergamot, mandarin, orange, violet leaf, fig leaf, carrot seed, sweet orris butter, iris, violet, rose de mai, jasmine sambac, vanilla, vetiver, cedar, ambergris"

Malt Eau de Parfum,Akro,"What happens when you cross a peaty Laphroaig whiskey with an aquatic? Malt. Sure, it's the answer to a question we don't remember asking, but we're so happy that such a thing actually exists. Opening with a gorgeously caramelized whiskey note that conjures up both the smokiness and the toffee-like depth of an aged whiskey from the highlands of Scotland, Malt quickly slips into a firmly mid-tone register: rich but light, with toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding it together. This deft lightness of touch is underscored by a minty, anisic tobacco-like note, which the notes say is seaweed. Certainly, this note gains in salt and crunch as time wears on, but while it is redolent of the sea, it less the sweet, melony undertone of Calone-driven aquatics, and more the naturally green, salty outdoorsy air blowing in off the North Sea. Wearing Malt feels like drinking a glass of peaty Scotch with friends at a beach bonfire on a cold October evening, the air infused with salt, heather, and good, old-fashioned bonhomie.","whiskey, rum, leather, seaweed, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,happens cross peaty laphroaig whiskey aquatic malt sure answer question remember asking we're happy thing actually exists opening gorgeously caramelized whiskey note conjures smokiness toffee like depth aged whiskey highlands scotland malt quickly slips firmly mid tone register rich light toasty brown woods unobtrusively holding together deft lightness touch underscored minty anisic tobacco like note notes say seaweed certainly note gains salt crunch time wears redolent sea less sweet melony undertone calone driven aquatics naturally green salty outdoorsy air blowing north sea wearing malt feels like drinking glass peaty scotch friends beach bonfire cold october evening air infused salt heather good old fashioned bonhomie,"whiskey, rum, leather, seaweed, patchouli"
Dark Eau de Parfum,Akro,"Oh man, this is good. A thick pour of molten dark chocolate to begin with, as strong and as intense as an espresso, but absent any of the metallic or animalic aspects that can sometimes emerge in dark chocolate. This is dark chocolate idealized. It's not sweet or creamy, but there's a strong hint of caramelized milk running underneath the rafters of the scent to pull it back from acridity. It's pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss.
Throughout the day, as the dark chocolate tonality ebbs away, a gloriously rich, nutty base steps forward to fill the vacuum. Spicy, cinnamon-flecked tonka and hazelnut notes combine with vanilla to create a suede-textured drydown that seems to go on forever without shedding any of its richness â a thing of beauty in a world where oftentimes the ending is rushed. Interestingly, though from the same hand that created Angel, Dark is its complete opposite â plush but not fruity, and gourmand but not edible or 'yummy'. Dark is an exquisitely balanced, elegant chocolate quasi-gourmand that leans to the adult side of the indulgence spectrum. An utter pleasure to wear.","cocoa, dark chocolate, cinnamon, hazelnut, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oh man good thick pour molten dark chocolate begin strong intense espresso absent metallic animalic aspects sometimes emerge dark chocolate dark chocolate idealized sweet creamy there's strong hint caramelized milk running underneath rafters scent pull back acridity pure unadulterated dark chocolate bliss throughout day dark chocolate tonality ebbs away gloriously rich nutty base steps forward fill vacuum spicy cinnamon flecked tonka hazelnut notes combine vanilla create suede textured drydown seems go forever without shedding richness thing beauty world oftentimes ending rushed interestingly though hand created angel dark complete opposite plush fruity gourmand edible 'yummy' dark exquisitely balanced elegant chocolate quasi gourmand leans adult side indulgence spectrum utter pleasure wear,"cocoa, dark chocolate, cinnamon, hazelnut, vanilla"
Night Eau de Parfum,Akro,"Night will make you blush. A finger stroke's worth of cumin imbues an innocently rosy musk with enough inner thigh naughtiness to stop anyone in their track's, retrace their steps, and follow that divine scent to its source: you. Night is sexy because it dances on that barely perceptible line between clean and dirty, never tipping its hand too far in one direction or the other, and therefore keeping you guessing all the way through.
Picture the aftermath of love â sheets tangled, traces of clean sweat and passionate kisses cooling quickly on the pillow. Your lover's gone, but everything still smells of them, including your skin and hair. Mingling with the scent of love is the fresh smell of the neroli and rose soap you both washed with that morning, and the starchy brightness of just-laundered sheets. The prismatic dance between clean and dirty, fresh and lived-in in Night is utterly entrancing; it feels sexy and alive and human.","rose, cumin, saffron, agaroud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,night make blush finger stroke's worth cumin imbues innocently rosy musk enough inner thigh naughtiness stop anyone track's retrace steps follow divine scent source night sexy dances barely perceptible line clean dirty never tipping hand far one direction therefore keeping guessing way picture aftermath love sheets tangled traces clean sweat passionate kisses cooling quickly pillow lover's gone everything still smells including skin hair mingling scent love fresh smell neroli rose soap washed morning starchy brightness laundered sheets prismatic dance clean dirty fresh lived night utterly entrancing feels sexy alive human,"rose, cumin, saffron, agaroud"
Smoke Eau de Parfum,Akro,"Smoking. The ultimate modern taboo. A dirty word. And yet, for those old enough to remember, there is something viscerally pleasing about the acrid aroma of a freshly-lit cigarette â perhaps because all the more attractive for its illicit, banned-in-public places, worse-than-marijuana notoriety it now enjoys. How AKRO Smoke smells to you will depend on your experience with smoking. For reformed smokers, it will smell nostalgic and haunting, a memory of coats, hair, and rooms impregnated with the acrid scent of cigarettes long stubbed out. For the uninitiated, it may smell almost shockingly intense, boasting a range of aromas from rubber and camphor to ash. A smidgen of sweetness from creamy tonka and powdery benzoin in the base is there for support, but in the end, there is nothing sweet or gourmand about this. Just a transparent, weightless wash of honest-to-goodness second hand cigarette smoke on the skin; sexy in a grimy, lived-in way that's difficult to explain to anyone who's never indulged. If you love Jeke by Slumberhouse, but want a summer-sheer version, then Smoke should be on your sample list.","bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, rose, jasmine, champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musk, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,smoking ultimate modern taboo dirty word yet old enough remember something viscerally pleasing acrid aroma freshly lit cigarette perhaps attractive illicit banned public places worse marijuana notoriety enjoys akro smoke smells depend experience smoking reformed smokers smell nostalgic haunting memory coats hair rooms impregnated acrid scent cigarettes long stubbed uninitiated may smell almost shockingly intense boasting range aromas rubber camphor ash smidgen sweetness creamy tonka powdery benzoin base support end nothing sweet gourmand transparent weightless wash honest goodness second hand cigarette smoke skin sexy grimy lived way that's difficult explain anyone who's never indulged love jeke slumberhouse want summer sheer version smoke sample list,"bergamot, mandarin, blackcurrant, rose, jasmine, champaca, lily-of-the-valley, orange flower, heliotrope, orris, raspberry, peach, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, haitian amyris, oakmoss, sandalwood, benzoin, styrax, tonka, vanilla, amber, ambrette, white musk, castoreum"
Haze Eau de Parfum,Akro,"Haze is the aromatic fog of a Bohemian cafe, where the lurid green fairy of absinthe mingles with the sage-bush dryness of an illicit spliff. But surprisingly, before it is all this, it is a whirlwind brush with a kitchen garden after a downpour, a riotous vortex of crushed mint, snapped plant stems, and the herbal dewiness of clary sage. It smells like fresh lavender buds and wet soil, a winning mixture of sun-warmed herbs and the cool dampness of a spring shower. Deeply herbal and green, Haze slowly starts to dry out to the bittersweet, grassy smokiness that will later define it as a creature of the night. A boozy artemisia note adds that anisic, Pernod-like twang that still, years after absinthe was made legal again, feels quite naughty. The impression of marijuana is there, but subtly so, and certainly not enough to get you pulled over by the police. A softly smoky leather accent in the base ties it all together pulling the scent from bright, wet, sunlit kitchen herbs to poetry reading in a Parisian cafe in one easy, fluid arc. Sexy in a casually-tousled way, Haze is for those who like fresh and aromatic, but done with an irreverent twist.","absinthe, armoise, eucalyptus, spearmint, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/821005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,haze aromatic fog bohemian cafe lurid green fairy absinthe mingles sage bush dryness illicit spliff surprisingly whirlwind brush kitchen garden downpour riotous vortex crushed mint snapped plant stems herbal dewiness clary sage smells like fresh lavender buds wet soil winning mixture sun warmed herbs cool dampness spring shower deeply herbal green haze slowly starts dry bittersweet grassy smokiness later define creature night boozy artemisia note adds anisic pernod like twang still years absinthe made legal feels quite naughty impression marijuana subtly certainly enough get pulled police softly smoky leather accent base ties together pulling scent bright wet sunlit kitchen herbs poetry reading parisian cafe one easy fluid arc sexy casually tousled way haze like fresh aromatic done irreverent twist,"absinthe, armoise, eucalyptus, spearmint, clary sage"
Molecule 02 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Ambroxan is the ingredient around which Molecule 02 orbits around exclusively (sister scent Escentric 02 blends the note with others). Natural ambroxan is one of the lusted after components of ambergris, the prohibitively costly, rare excretion of a sperm whale. To be absolutely honest, when we tried this, we were shocked by its subtlety...and we mean subtle. In fact, all we can smell is a smooth, skin-like, we-can't-put-our-finger-on-it fragrance afterthought that might as well be our own skin...but it isn't. There is a slight mineral-like edge to it but it's transparent and mild...if you're the type of person who can instantly tell the taste of plain water versus a mineral water like Evian, you'll instantly pick up on the gentle nuances of Molecule 02. To sum it up, Molecule 02 is very light yet always present and hovering about four inches above where you applied it, especially after a few hours. The term 'skin scent' has never been more embodied than in this perfume and we bet it will both fascinate and confuse perfume lovers for a long time to come.

Escentric 02 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"While its sister scent Molecule 02 is built around the single note of ambroxan (the manmade equivalent of costly natural ambergris), Escentric 02 blends the note with vetiver and the cruelty-free musk imposter muscone. Add just a touch of orris, elderflower extract and the sunny, jasmine-like feel of hedione and it's light, refreshing and yes, even brisk fragrance that sparkles and enchants from beginning to end. It's the kind of brisk you think of when smelling a freshly poured gin and tonic over lots and lots of ice, only Escentric has a fascinating mineral-like finish that amps things up to super spectacular. It's a wear anytime, go anywhere type of scent with a very relaxed, unassuming nature...utterly at ease, totally uncomplicated and easy going, we find ourselves reaching for it over and over when everything else just seems not quite right that day.

Bana Banana Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"The story of Bana Banana is, unlikely as this may seem, the story of the creation of L'Artisan Parfumeur. In the 1970's, chemist and plant collector Jean-Francois Laporte was planning to attend the legendarily exuberant and creative Les Folies Bergeres, and needed to up the ante for his latest look, which was, of course, a banana costume. Drawing on his knowledge of natural materials, he created a banana scent for himself, and in the process he discovered a heretofore unknown passion for fragrance made with traditional methods and exceptional raw materials, a calling that would eventually result in his founding of L'Artisan Parfumeur with the help of master perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena. Now, in collaboration with his daughter Celine Ellena, L'Artisan resurrects that legendary scent, reimagined with all the style, skill, and quality for which the brand has become famous. Oh, but did we mention how unbelievably fun it is? The banana is rich, green, and fruity, surrounded with lively pepper and savory nutmeg, the floral aspects reinforced with milky jasmine and gently powdered iris and violet to coax the impression of ripe banana skin. Warm, tonka-infused amber foregrounds the fruit, lingering like the heat of the sun at dusk. Playful yet sophisticated, and rich in both character and history, Bana Banana is more than just a banana scent- it's the legacy of L'Artisan Parfumeur in a bottle.","pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152025.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,story bana banana unlikely may seem story creation l'artisan parfumeur 's chemist plant collector jean francois laporte planning attend legendarily exuberant creative les folies bergeres needed ante latest look course banana costume drawing knowledge natural materials created banana scent process discovered heretofore unknown passion fragrance made traditional methods exceptional raw materials calling would eventually result founding l'artisan parfumeur help master perfumer jean claude ellena collaboration daughter celine ellena l'artisan resurrects legendary scent reimagined style skill quality brand become famous oh mention unbelievably fun banana rich green fruity surrounded lively pepper savory nutmeg floral aspects reinforced milky jasmine gently powdered iris violet coax impression ripe banana skin warm tonka infused amber foregrounds fruit lingering like heat sun dusk playful yet sophisticated rich character history bana banana banana scent legacy l'artisan parfumeur bottle,"pepper, nutmeg, violet, jasmine, iris, banana, banana flower, tonka, musk, amber"
Easy To Love Eau de Parfum,Eau d'Italie,"One thing Italians love is an anniversary celebration. And so it's only fitting that the Eau d'Italie fragrance line, created 15 years ago to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Hotel Le Sireneuse Positano, has now begat a celebratory milestone of its own. Easy To Love, a love letter to fragrance, hospitality, and the stunning beauty of the Amalfi Coast, more than lives up to its name, wrapping us up in a lovely and soothing blend of fresh florals and juicy fig as seductive and timeless as Italy itself. It's a delightful example of quality over complication, with each note playing a vital role- white currant, sweeter than its better-known black and red siblings, still lends a distinctive tart buzz to the creamy, green fig note, made even fresher with a gentle peony. And lest we forget that la dolce vita is as much about sensory pleasures as it is the beauty of nature, Easy To Love features a luscious base of sweet honey, tonka bean, and subtly sensual ambrette musk- a nod to the food, drink, and romance one almost can't help but experience on the Mediterranean. If 15 years of Eau d'Italie resulted in a scent this carefree and wonderful, we can't wait to see what milestones we'll be celebrating next.","white currant, fig, white peony, honey, tonka, ambrette",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43237.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one thing italians love anniversary celebration fitting eau d'italie fragrance line created years ago celebrate th anniversary hotel le sireneuse positano begat celebratory milestone easy love love letter fragrance hospitality stunning beauty amalfi coast lives name wrapping us lovely soothing blend fresh florals juicy fig seductive timeless italy delightful example quality complication note playing vital role white currant sweeter better known black red siblings still lends distinctive tart buzz creamy green fig note made even fresher gentle peony lest forget la dolce vita much sensory pleasures beauty nature easy love features luscious base sweet honey tonka bean subtly sensual ambrette musk nod food drink romance one almost can't help experience mediterranean years eau d'italie resulted scent carefree wonderful can't wait see milestones we'll celebrating next,"white currant, fig, white peony, honey, tonka, ambrette"
Cassili Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"At the intersection of desire and delicacy, Cassili is a fruity-floral beauty that reminds us that Parfums de Marly does feminine scents with every bit as much modern-meets-classic complexity as their much-heralded masculines. Exploding with triumphant fruitiness, yet anchored by a sophisticated woodsy gourmand base, Cassili is both fashion-forward and refined, with a true Parfums de Marly signature. From the first spray, Cassili leaps off the skin with joyful abandon, featuring mouthwatering notes of plum and redcurrant set against lushly textured florals- romantic rose, fresh mimosa and peachy plumeria, a delightful bouquet with enough sweetness to swoon over, but also enough floral firepower to seduce. As the complexly gourmand drydown- a creamy blend of vanilla and sandalwood- develops, we find ourselves completely under its spell.

Ganymede Eau de Parfum,Marc-Antoine Barrois,"Ganymede, the rocky satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1610 by Galileo, both luminous and covered with salt-water oceans. In collaboration with Quentin Bisch, Marc-Antoine Barrois has dreamt of the essence of this new planet: an elegant and unexpected harmony around a quartet of mandarin, violet, immortelle and suede.
Ganymede once again makes use of the suede-leathery notes that made their first collaboration, B683, an instant classic. This time though, the leather notes become softer, gaining lightness and gentleness in contact with the fragrance of violet. Mandarin still brings intense brightness and vivacity, yet immortelle adds sublime balance, using salty and mineralic tones to act as a striking counterpoint. A galactic olfactory harmony both delicate and balanced, full of energy, sensuality, and contrast, Ganymede is quite unlike any fragrance on the planet- or elsewhere. What We Think A saltier, more floral interpretation of the ultra-smooth top grain leather also featured in B683- airy but still substantial.","mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, immortelle absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/822001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ganymede rocky satellite jupiter discovered galileo luminous covered salt water oceans collaboration quentin bisch marc antoine barrois dreamt essence new planet elegant unexpected harmony around quartet mandarin violet immortelle suede ganymede makes use suede leathery notes made first collaboration b instant classic time though leather notes become softer gaining lightness gentleness contact fragrance violet mandarin still brings intense brightness vivacity yet immortelle adds sublime balance using salty mineralic tones act striking counterpoint galactic olfactory harmony delicate balanced full energy sensuality contrast ganymede quite unlike fragrance planet elsewhere think saltier floral interpretation ultra smooth top grain leather also featured b airy still substantial,"mandarin, saffron, violet, osmanthus absolute, akigalawood, immortelle absolute"
No. 1 Tonic Blanc Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"As fresh and as effortlessly elegant as a clean white shirt on a hot Sunday morning. No. 1 Tonic Blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk of being both juicy and bone-dry at the same time, like an orange squeezed into a glass of ice-cold vermouth. The neroli note is astonishingly pithy at first, its tartness boldly underlined by bergamot, mandarin, and the waxy green leafiness of the neroli itself. It's a slap in the face of heat.
As the heart develops, the bitterness of the citrus notes is mellowed out with a softly honeyed orange blossom note and the cheerful brightness of mock orange. Yet, the scent never entirely devolves into the lush sweetness of white flowers. The sparkling, vermouth-like dryness that forms the core of the scent is shored up by a stirringly mossy, woodsy basenote and a musk that extends the just-washed linen muskiness of the neroli. This one's easy â a crisp, no-brainer neroli stunner for fighting your corner in the heat. Fantastic on both women and men.","bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fresh effortlessly elegant clean white shirt hot sunday morning tonic blanc brilliantly captures neroli's quirk juicy bone dry time like orange squeezed glass ice cold vermouth neroli note astonishingly pithy first tartness boldly underlined bergamot mandarin waxy green leafiness neroli slap face heat heart develops bitterness citrus notes mellowed softly honeyed orange blossom note cheerful brightness mock orange yet scent never entirely devolves lush sweetness white flowers sparkling vermouth like dryness forms core scent shored stirringly mossy woodsy basenote musk extends washed linen muskiness neroli one's easy crisp brainer neroli stunner fighting corner heat fantastic women men,"bergamot, mandarin, orange, neroli, orange flower blossom, bergamot flower blossom, mock orange flower, oakmoss, sandalwood, cedarwood, musk"
No. 2 Seve Nouvelle Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Seve Nouvelle is the scent of new sap rising, of boundless energy roiling up and out - a sense of excitement that can no longer be contained. With its opening salvo of pink grapefruit effervescing upwards in a surge of creamy white soap bubbles, this cannot fail to make you smile. A playful raspberry brings a blush to the buttery saffron suede lying just beneath, while the joyous pop of champaca flower makes you think of those clear green shampoos that Wella Balsam made in the 1970's that were half-woods, half-Granny Smith apple. This peppery explosion of citrus and flowers fizzes brightly for a while before folding itself into a soft, incensey drydown that's almost creamy with amber and cashmeran. Seve Nouvelle goes from spiky to fuzzy in one seamless swoop, a soft, raspberry-tinted putty note remaining in place all the way through. While this is a very modern take on fruit, flowers, and suede, a stirring wisp of temple incense in the base gives Seve Nouvelle a stirring sense of the exotic and the familiar all at once.","grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,seve nouvelle scent new sap rising boundless energy roiling sense excitement longer contained opening salvo pink grapefruit effervescing upwards surge creamy white soap bubbles cannot fail make smile playful raspberry brings blush buttery saffron suede lying beneath joyous pop champaca flower makes think clear green shampoos wella balsam made 's half woods half granny smith apple peppery explosion citrus flowers fizzes brightly folding soft incensey drydown that's almost creamy amber cashmeran seve nouvelle goes spiky fuzzy one seamless swoop soft raspberry tinted putty note remaining place way modern take fruit flowers suede stirring wisp temple incense base gives seve nouvelle stirring sense exotic familiar,"grapefruit, pink pepper, saffron, champaca, tonka bean, water pepper, patchouli, raspberry, cashmeran, amberwood, labdanum"
No. 3 Crepuscule Ardent Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Crepuscule Ardent sets a smoky strand of red-gold saffron to smolder in an incense burner, while a temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms through our hair. Echoes of a sweet Tuscan Leather-like aroma tease us, the heat magnifying the fug of soft leather, spice, and flowers until its fills the room. The intense aroma of saffron and jasmine is both pungent and creamy, like a lover's breath on the nape of the neck. Crepuscule Ardent's sexy leather is bold, then increasingly soft and milky as an Arabian style amber settles in towards the base. Nothing sweet or syrupy, however here, a, monumental frankincense note lends the scent a charcoal dust purity that cleanses the air and cuts through the fat. This is the scent that a Valkyrie wears as they stride towards the pyre, a glorious vision of black and gold light.","saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,crepuscule ardent sets smoky strand red gold saffron smolder incense burner temple attendant weaves jasmine blossoms hair echoes sweet tuscan leather like aroma tease us heat magnifying fug soft leather spice flowers fills room intense aroma saffron jasmine pungent creamy like lover's breath nape neck crepuscule ardent's sexy leather bold increasingly soft milky arabian style amber settles towards base nothing sweet syrupy however monumental frankincense note lends scent charcoal dust purity cleanses air cuts fat scent valkyrie wears stride towards pyre glorious vision black gold light,"saffron, olibanum, jasmine, leather, suede, amber"
No. 4 Apres l'Amour Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Apres l'Amour is a 1960's Serge Gainsbourg song filtered through the synth pop sensibilities of the 1980's: candied lemon-rind musks and animalic notes suspended in a haze of modern woody-ambery aromachemicals. It smells like human skin after lovemaking â erotically charged, moist, musky â but thanks to a mesh of powerfully dry, smoky woods and electric ambers, broadcast at high volume to the rest of the world. It's this constant shifting of the scent from intimate to radiant and back to intimate again that makes Apres l'Amour work. It seems to come with its own atmosphere - a crackle of electricity in the air; the rumbling of a storm to come.

No. 5 Frenesie Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"While most oud fragrances are proud and severe, their throaty, animalic rasp giving pause for thought, Frenesie is as soft and inviting as a freshly powdered bosom. Cowed into submission by an expansive floral bouquet dominated by an apricotty osmanthus, the oud is pushed to the edges of the scent, where it hums away sottovoce. Dressed up in this cloak of jammy florals, the oud is transformed into a glazed lychee tart that teeters on that quirky, Japanese-esque line between floral and fruity. The soft, gummy suede lurking beneath is the perfect counterpart to the syrupy osmanthus and roses, streaked here and there with a peppery peony bite. If we didn't know better, we'd swear there's violet in here too, casting an ethereal purple glow over the bouquet that holds it all together. Either way, the oud just a whisper, a faint trace of something woody in the lower register. A fuzzy haze of musk brings up the rear, diffusing the fudgy floral center into a spacey lightness. Lovely, and quite innocent-smelling.","saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oud fragrances proud severe throaty animalic rasp giving pause thought frenesie soft inviting freshly powdered bosom cowed submission expansive floral bouquet dominated apricotty osmanthus oud pushed edges scent hums away sottovoce dressed cloak jammy florals oud transformed glazed lychee tart teeters quirky japanese esque line floral fruity soft gummy suede lurking beneath perfect counterpart syrupy osmanthus roses streaked peppery peony bite know better we'd swear there's violet casting ethereal purple glow bouquet holds together either way oud whisper faint trace something woody lower register fuzzy haze musk brings rear diffusing fudgy floral center spacey lightness lovely quite innocent smelling,"saffron, bergamot, magnolia, rose, peony, osmanthus, gardenia, oud, amber, incense, musk"
No. 6 Brume Radieuse Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Brume Radieuse proves that Thomas Kosmala has a particular sleight of hand when it comes to creating oud fragrances that depart from the norm. If Frenesie is a bon-bon of oud seen through a misty haze of jammy osmanthus, then Brume Radieuse is its equally floral, but grown-up sister, full of a simmering sensuality that makes you sit up straight in your chair. A bruise of blackcurrant juice, thick and tannic, stains the opening a deep purplish black and sets up a sexy fruity-rose beat that carries on throughout. At the heart, a nugget of salty black truffle, this would be the oud, is flanked on all sides by a chorus of juicy peach and coconut notes, the combination of which bears some resemblance to the mouthwatering aquatic-black chocolate accord that underpins Tom Ford's Black Orchid. A veritable riot of fruit, flowers, coconut, peach, and salty-earthy notes, Brume Radieuse shouldn't really work, and yet does. This is one sexy, feminine fruity-floral oud bomb that will not go without notice. The equivalent of that special black dress you wear like a weapon.","blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,brume radieuse proves thomas kosmala particular sleight hand comes creating oud fragrances depart norm frenesie bon bon oud seen misty haze jammy osmanthus brume radieuse equally floral grown sister full simmering sensuality makes sit straight chair bruise blackcurrant juice thick tannic stains opening deep purplish black sets sexy fruity rose beat carries throughout heart nugget salty black truffle would oud flanked sides chorus juicy peach coconut notes combination bears resemblance mouthwatering aquatic black chocolate accord underpins tom ford's black orchid veritable riot fruit flowers coconut peach salty earthy notes brume radieuse really work yet one sexy feminine fruity floral oud bomb go without notice equivalent special black dress wear like weapon,"blackcurrant, peach, rose, coconut, jasmine, oud, patchouli, amber"
No. 7 Le Sel de la Terre Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Le Sel de la Terre is proof that Leonardo da Vinci's assertion that 'simplicity is the ultimate sophistication' is correct. Infuse a cloudy white musk with fresh lemon and crusty sea salt notes, and what you have is utter perfection. If it sounds trite or you think it's been done to death, then know that Kosmala's take distinguishes itself from the pack simply by virtue of smelling entirely natural, even when it is (clearly) not. The musk here is clean and sweet, a puff of laundry-hot air strangely unblemished by the chemical twang of cleaning solvents and enlivened with an expensive-smelling medley of lemon and bergamot. Le Sel de la Terre is a white shirt freshly pulled from the dryer, draped on a clean body, and generously doused in Monsieur Balmain, a paragon of elegance in its pairing of blond wood and citrus. A salty undertone is just enough to suggest the mineral tang of the beach without making you think of Calone or Ambroxan. Fantastic. We know what we're drenching ourselves this summer.","bergamot, lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,le sel de la terre proof leonardo da vinci's assertion 'simplicity ultimate sophistication' correct infuse cloudy white musk fresh lemon crusty sea salt notes utter perfection sounds trite think done death know kosmala's take distinguishes pack simply virtue smelling entirely natural even clearly musk clean sweet puff laundry hot air strangely unblemished chemical twang cleaning solvents enlivened expensive smelling medley lemon bergamot le sel de la terre white shirt freshly pulled dryer draped clean body generously doused monsieur balmain paragon elegance pairing blond wood citrus salty undertone enough suggest mineral tang beach without making think calone ambroxan fantastic know we're drenching summer,"bergamot, lemon, fresh marine notes, aqua, fresh floral, fresh wood, musk"
No. 8 Tonic Vert Eau de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Tonic Vert is a true tonic for the winter blues. With its crushed mint and sour citrus topnotes, the scent starts out with the stinging clarity of early morning sunshine cutting across a dark room. Unlike other green fragrances, it is neither soapy-soft or sappy-juicy. Rather, it is dry, dry, dry throughout, an essential bitterness focusing the mind and straightening the spine. Yet this is not a classic green scent like No. 19 or even Green Irish Tweed â Tonic Vert makes a feature of its modern single-mindedness. Though more naturalistic than abstract or synthetic, it nonetheless manages to convey an impression of crisp angularity that feels more at home in a boardroom than on a ramble through the fields. The combination of that earthy, bitter vetiver with the strange pink fruitiness of pomelo and the minty rosiness of geranium is arresting to the nth degree: in the murky darkness of deep winter, you'll want to spray this over and over just to let the light in again.","bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tonic vert true tonic winter blues crushed mint sour citrus topnotes scent starts stinging clarity early morning sunshine cutting across dark room unlike green fragrances neither soapy soft sappy juicy rather dry dry dry throughout essential bitterness focusing mind straightening spine yet classic green scent like even green irish tweed tonic vert makes feature modern single mindedness though naturalistic abstract synthetic nonetheless manages convey impression crisp angularity feels home boardroom ramble fields combination earthy bitter vetiver strange pink fruitiness pomelo minty rosiness geranium arresting nth degree murky darkness deep winter want spray let light,"bergamot, lemon, mandarin, lime, mint, geranium, pomelo, vetiver, musk, oakmoss"
No. 9 Bukhoor Elixir de Parfum,Thomas Kosmala,"Bukhoor, or bakhoor as it is sometimes known, is the Arabic name for woodchips that have been soaked in precious essential oils, mixed with shards of frankincense and other resins, and finally pressed into soft, brownish bricks to be smoked slowly over an incense burner. All over the Middle East, bukhoor is burned generously to banish domestic smells of cooking and to make the home smell warm and welcoming to visitors. Bukhoor, Thomas Kosmala's take on the theme, honors its source material by being rich, smoky, and pugnacious, with an Arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic. The animalic bite of aged Hindi oud hits the nose first, its characteristic aroma of raw leather, and slightly dirty hay burning a blaze across the olfactory landscape. The scent mellows considerably in the base, where it takes a turn for dry and smoky, a smoldering woods note infusing the atmosphere with the marvelous scent of burnt paper, benzoin, and brown sugar. A bold, no-holds-barred take on an ancient material, and one that proves Kosmala's skill in handling it.","woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/82008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bukhoor bakhoor sometimes known arabic name woodchips soaked precious essential oils mixed shards frankincense resins finally pressed soft brownish bricks smoked slowly incense burner middle east bukhoor burned generously banish domestic smells cooking make home smell warm welcoming visitors bukhoor thomas kosmala's take theme honors source material rich smoky pugnacious arabic personality that's surprisingly authentic animalic bite aged hindi oud hits nose first characteristic aroma raw leather slightly dirty hay burning blaze across olfactory landscape scent mellows considerably base takes turn dry smoky smoldering woods note infusing atmosphere marvelous scent burnt paper benzoin brown sugar bold holds barred take ancient material one proves kosmala's skill handling,"woody accords, smoky accords, agarwood, amber, musk"
Beaute du Diable Eau de Parfum,Liquides Imaginaires,"""Would you be willing to sell your soul to the Devil to possess his perfume? This essence is part of his powers, of his eternal seduction.""
So reads Liquides Imaginaires' tagline for Beaute du Diable, a spicy, sweet, richly aromatic concoction that opens like a perfect gin on the rocks before taking a turn into richly spicy florals and aromatic cypress before settling into a dusty, smoky, smolderingly sexy fragrance that's as irresistible as it is hard to define. Picture the devil as a gorgeously androgynous figure in an immaculately tailored suit strolling towards you down a gaslamp-lit cobblestone alley, a puff of smoke rising from the street with each footstep. You're nervous, but intrigued, and as soon as their scent hits your nose, you know that for tonight, at least, you're going to go wherever they want you to go. That's the seductive, mysterious power of Beaute du Diable.","lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang-ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,would willing sell soul devil possess perfume essence part powers eternal seduction reads liquides imaginaires' tagline beaute du diable spicy sweet richly aromatic concoction opens like perfect gin rocks taking turn richly spicy florals aromatic cypress settling dusty smoky smolderingly sexy fragrance that's irresistible hard define picture devil gorgeously androgynous figure immaculately tailored suit strolling towards gaslamp lit cobblestone alley puff smoke rising street footstep nervous intrigued soon scent hits nose know tonight least going go wherever want go that's seductive mysterious power beaute du diable,"lemon, coriander, bitter orange, gin accord, absinthe, clove, cypress, geranium, ylang-ylang, carnation, vetiver, gaiac, cistus, cobblestone accord"
Oud Monarch Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"Plenty of fragrances are powerful or complex, but what makes a scent truly regal? In the case of Oud Monarch, the answer is power and complexity in the service of pure, indulgent, delightful comfort. Just as Areej Le Dore's Oud Luwak gave us the why-didn't-we-think-of-that savory voluptuousness of oud and coffee, so too does Oud Monarch delve deep into gourmand territory, delivering a richly mouthwatering cocoa-infused oud scent as luxuriously smooth as the finest royal vestments. While the oud on display is as precious and potent as in any scent we carry (as with all Bortnikoff ouds, it features frequent collaborator Russian Adam's treasured and rare ""Feel Oud""), the introduction of a rich cacao note does a miraculous thing, smoothing the animalic roar of the oud into a smooth and delicious purr that still resonates with power. It's so blissfully intense that it truly takes a moment for your nose to adjust, at which point you can appreciate the masterful attention to detail behind the potency- smooth, sweet florals, spiced tobacco and resin- all perfectly pitched to keep every sniff unique and intriguing. Oud lovers, chocolate fanatics, come together: here is a fragrance fit for a Monarch.","magnolia, frangipani, rose de mai, rose, cinnamon, tobacco, oud merauke, oud co chang (feel-oud), cacao, civet, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,plenty fragrances powerful complex makes scent truly regal case oud monarch answer power complexity service pure indulgent delightful comfort areej le dore's oud luwak gave us think savory voluptuousness oud coffee oud monarch delve deep gourmand territory delivering richly mouthwatering cocoa infused oud scent luxuriously smooth finest royal vestments oud display precious potent scent carry bortnikoff ouds features frequent collaborator russian adam's treasured rare feel oud introduction rich cacao note miraculous thing smoothing animalic roar oud smooth delicious purr still resonates power blissfully intense truly takes moment nose adjust point appreciate masterful attention detail behind potency smooth sweet florals spiced tobacco resin perfectly pitched keep every sniff unique intriguing oud lovers chocolate fanatics come together fragrance fit monarch,"magnolia, frangipani, rose de mai, rose, cinnamon, tobacco, oud merauke, oud co chang (feel-oud), cacao, civet, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla"
Amber Cologne Eau de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"What makes Bortnikoff scents so special is not merely the inclusion of exceptional materials, but the vision required to do something novel and amazing with them. Take Amber Cologne, which features an impressive amount of real grey and brown ambergris, in all of its richly mineralic salty-sweet glory. It's an increasingly rare star player in perfume, so who in their right mind would put it into an ordinary citrus-and-woods cologne? It seems Bortnikoff would, and the results turn out to be far from ordinary. It doesn't hurt that the citrus in question is eye-poppingly fresh, an arresting blend of juicy bergamot, zesty lemon, sweet orange, and deliciously tart grapefruit, making the mouth water and the senses ignite. And once ignited, we find ourselves primed for the most gorgeously comfortable blend of ambergris and woods we could ever hope for- salty and gently animalic, to be sure, but moreover simply aglow with a luminous warmth that drills through every level of artifice in your memory to connect with the perfect ideal of sun-kissed skin at the beach- soft, smooth, and unbelievably sexy. Flourishes of florals and real oud provide support and structure, coaxing every last aspect from the ambergris, which glows for untold hours of sheer bliss. Perhaps the easiest-to-wear Bortnikoff yet, Amber Cologne is a simple, wonderful idea executed with flawless mastery and unparalleled quality.","bergamot, lemon, white pink grapefruit, sweet orange, cardamom, frangipani, jasmine sambac, cedarwood, sandalwood, grey brown ambergris, oud, bouya oud, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/804007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,makes bortnikoff scents special merely inclusion exceptional materials vision required something novel amazing take amber cologne features impressive amount real grey brown ambergris richly mineralic salty sweet glory increasingly rare star player perfume right mind would put ordinary citrus woods cologne seems bortnikoff would results turn far ordinary hurt citrus question eye poppingly fresh arresting blend juicy bergamot zesty lemon sweet orange deliciously tart grapefruit making mouth water senses ignite ignited find primed gorgeously comfortable blend ambergris woods could ever hope salty gently animalic sure moreover simply aglow luminous warmth drills every level artifice memory connect perfect ideal sun kissed skin beach soft smooth unbelievably sexy flourishes florals real oud provide support structure coaxing every last aspect ambergris glows untold hours sheer bliss perhaps easiest wear bortnikoff yet amber cologne simple wonderful idea executed flawless mastery unparalleled quality,"bergamot, lemon, white pink grapefruit, sweet orange, cardamom, frangipani, jasmine sambac, cedarwood, sandalwood, grey brown ambergris, oud, bouya oud, vanilla"
Musk Khabib Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"Musk Khabib isn't so much a fragrance as an experience. Sure, it's a wonderfully opulent chypre built on bright bergamot, spicy florals, and a rich yet fresh base of moss and musk the likes of which are rarely seen in modern perfumery. But we can't shake the feeling that it wasn't even meant to wear in public, but rather for the true perfume lover to lock themselves away from the world and apply heavily, shaking with giddy delight as each sniff brings a wholly novel combination of its featured notes: one moment intensely bright and spicy, the next warm and animalic, then perhaps creamy and sweet, and back again- an overflowing and ever-replenishing treasure chest of olfactory riches. It's a collector's scent, the kind you'll vacillate between wanting to use up in a single day and save forever. Lovers of Areej Le Dore's Russian Musk, and those who never got a chance to try it, your opportunity to exult in a truly vintage-style musk scent has come around again.

Sensual Instinct Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Lush, sweet, and deeply intoxicating, Sensual Instinct is a journey through a kaleidoscopic fantasyland where mouthwatering fruit, romantic florals, and rich gourmand notes intertwine with uncontrollable abandon. A must-have for lovers of truly full-bodied fragrance, it's an explosion of deeply resonant, highly colorful scents certain to get your pulse racing. Every moment is full of contrast and serendipitous pairings, as an opening of ultra-bright bergamot and mandarin is matched with sweet, smooth cardamom and boozy whiskey. As the ambered, lushly drawn florals of the heart notes swell, so too does a delectable tiramisu accord, all set against a rich, gently earthy patchouli. And as the gourmand base of coffee, cacao, and vanilla intensifies, so too does the seductive power of this unforgettable scent.

Vetiver Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale,"With so much attention paid to Montale's rich, complex florientals and gourmands, it's easy to forget how well they do fresh and spicy (hello Red Vetiver!). And so it is with great pleasure that we introduce Vetiver Patchouli, a fiercely bright and fiery spicy-fresh fragrance that ignites the senses and invigorates the spirit. From the eye-popping burst of citrus and pink pepper in the opening to the surprising combination of gently sweet carrot, rich jasmin grandiflorum, and woodsy patchouli of the heart, and finally, the complexity of the spicy, woodsy, delicately earthy vetiver base, which lingers for hours with a sheer masculine sensuality that, truth be told, is every bit as captivating on a woman who prefers action to talk. While we're never upset with any new release from this venerable house, let us be the first to say: welcome back, Fresh Montale. We've missed you.","bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,much attention paid montale's rich complex florientals gourmands easy forget well fresh spicy hello red vetiver great pleasure introduce vetiver patchouli fiercely bright fiery spicy fresh fragrance ignites senses invigorates spirit eye popping burst citrus pink pepper opening surprising combination gently sweet carrot rich jasmin grandiflorum woodsy patchouli heart finally complexity spicy woodsy delicately earthy vetiver base lingers hours sheer masculine sensuality truth told every bit captivating woman prefers action talk we're never upset new release venerable house let us first say welcome back fresh montale we've missed,"bergamot, mandarin, pink pepper, carrot, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, white musk"
Oud Dream Eau de Parfum,Montale,"When one thinks of a Montale oud, lavishly exotic and over-the-top cocktails of fruit and musk come to mind. And while those are wonderful, Oud Dream is a different sort of oud scent, a delicately sweet and spicy musky oud better suited for a romantic night under the desert stars instead of a disco ball, no matter what it might look like on the bottle. The key difference is a lovely touch of restraint- notes like ""sweet honey"" and black pepper are, in fact, handled deftly, never sticky-sweet or nose-crunchingly spicy. Even the rose-oud of the heart is toned down from the opulence of Roses Musk, feeling smooth and romantic and keeping you leaning in for more. Don't get us wrong- there's still a place for the opulence of Montale's other oud scents. But once the sun sets, the situation calls for a touch of elegance- and that's when Oud Dream has its chance to shine.","bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one thinks montale oud lavishly exotic top cocktails fruit musk come mind wonderful oud dream different sort oud scent delicately sweet spicy musky oud better suited romantic night desert stars instead disco ball matter might look like bottle key difference lovely touch restraint notes like sweet honey black pepper fact handled deftly never sticky sweet nose crunchingly spicy even rose oud heart toned opulence roses musk feeling smooth romantic keeping leaning get us wrong there's still place opulence montale's oud scents sun sets situation calls touch elegance that's oud dream chance shine,"bergamot, cardamom, coriander, black pepper, sweet honey, rose, oud, patchouli, cedar, leather, amber, musk"
Holy Water Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"A rose-and-sandal attar in the body of a French eau de cologne. In the Middle East and India, some attars are composed specifically to protect the soul from djinns, or evil spirits. In the West, we use citrusy colognes to refresh the body in hot weather. Both concepts are rooted in the belief that certain materials in perfumery possess an excoriating, cleansing power to drive out bad spirits and bad smells. Abdes Salaam Attar's Holy Water (Aqua Santa) is a perfume bridge between the Eastern concept of purifying one's soul and the Western concept of refreshing the physical. In pairing a bitter orange note with a dusty, ethereal frankincense, and placing it all in the context of a fresh eau de cologne, Holy Water emerges as a true hybrid between the Eastern and Western 'eaux de protection'. It's an almost medieval idea, but it works perfectly. A sweet, carefree orange blossom note gentles the piney austerity of the frankincense, softening what could have been an angular church incense into a hazy cloud of fruit, rose, and sandalwood. Although more fresh than sweet, Holy Water has a pleasing marshmallowy softness at its core that mitigates the impact of the tougher resinous and woody notes. It smells clean, vigorous, and above all, spiritually uplifting. Apply generously in times of sadness, melancholy, or simply when the greyness of the sky is wearing you down. Holy Water is a shot of sunshine delivered straight to your soul.","frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rose sandal attar body french eau de cologne middle east india attars composed specifically protect soul djinns evil spirits west use citrusy colognes refresh body hot weather concepts rooted belief certain materials perfumery possess excoriating cleansing power drive bad spirits bad smells abdes salaam attar's holy water aqua santa perfume bridge eastern concept purifying one's soul western concept refreshing physical pairing bitter orange note dusty ethereal frankincense placing context fresh eau de cologne holy water emerges true hybrid eastern western 'eaux de protection' almost medieval idea works perfectly sweet carefree orange blossom note gentles piney austerity frankincense softening could angular church incense hazy cloud fruit rose sandalwood although fresh sweet holy water pleasing marshmallowy softness core mitigates impact tougher resinous woody notes smells clean vigorous spiritually uplifting apply generously times sadness melancholy simply greyness sky wearing holy water shot sunshine delivered straight soul,"frankincense, sandalwood, orange, orange blossom, rose"
Mecca Balsam Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Opening on a rich, smoky stew of incense over the crackle of dried tobacco leaf, Mecca Balsam sends the senses reeling, as if you'd suddenly stepped into the scent trail of a thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft as they circle the Black Stone in Mecca. Despite the tarry heft of the sticky balsams and resins, there is an airy sweetness to the underlying structure âÂ a sort of smoked-out incense fairy dust âÂ that elevates the scent and keeps it airborne. A common complaint leveled at incense scents is that they feel cold or severe, but there's no danger of that here. Dubrana has balanced the ancient salve-like feel of the incense with a musky, saline labdanum that reads like warm skin, in one stroke banishing any thought of High Church and drawing our mind instead to what he originally intended Mecca Balsam to reflect: the seething mass of human souls gathered around the Kaaba to perform the Hajj. Mecca Balsam is both sacred and divine, therefore, pitching the throat-catching aridity of incense against the warm, sweet embrace of flowers and amber. Unusual in that it simultaneously purifies and comforts, Mecca Balsam feels less like perfume than it does a statement of faith.","tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,opening rich smoky stew incense crackle dried tobacco leaf mecca balsam sends senses reeling suddenly stepped scent trail thousand pilgrims holding burning censers aloft circle black stone mecca despite tarry heft sticky balsams resins airy sweetness underlying structure sort smoked incense fairy dust elevates scent keeps airborne common complaint leveled incense scents feel cold severe there's danger dubrana balanced ancient salve like feel incense musky saline labdanum reads like warm skin one stroke banishing thought high church drawing mind instead originally intended mecca balsam reflect seething mass human souls gathered around kaaba perform hajj mecca balsam sacred divine therefore pitching throat catching aridity incense warm sweet embrace flowers amber unusual simultaneously purifies comforts mecca balsam feels less like perfume statement faith,"tuberose, tobacco, rose, benzoin, agarwood, incense, labdanum, tonka bean"
Milano Caffe Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Milan is a city that prides itself on the uncompromising purity of its espresso, and in Milano Caffe, the roasted bitterness of the bean meets its match in a square of viciously dark chocolate. If you've ever sipped an espresso while nibbling on a bar of 80% cacao chocolate, then you'll be familiar with the dark, burnt edge that connects them on the Venn diagram of taste. Dubrana feeds it to us straight for a while, no sugar or milk, and it's so intense that little sips are in order. Earthy and bold, the scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like the steamy vapors in a Milanese coffee house. Slowly, the master eases up on the intensity of the coffee-cocoa double whammy, drip-feeding a powdery iris into the mix like a tip of the milk jug. This is followed closely by the mocha almond creamer of tonka bean. Now we move out of pure espresso territory and into the creamy, cocoa-sprinkled milkiness of a cappuccino. It's rich but definitely not sweet, a hint of fiery cinnamon in the opoponax lending a nubbin of spice that adds texture to the silken flow. A dash of incense additionally lends an interesting salt-n-pepper tartness that stops any gourmandise in its tracks. Still incredibly indulgent, Milano Caffe is the tira-mi-su (meaning 'pick-me-up' in Italian) the adults in the room have been waiting for.","coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,milan city prides uncompromising purity espresso milano caffe roasted bitterness bean meets match square viciously dark chocolate ever sipped espresso nibbling bar cacao chocolate familiar dark burnt edge connects venn diagram taste dubrana feeds us straight sugar milk intense little sips order earthy bold scent's velvety thickness wraps around us like steamy vapors milanese coffee house slowly master eases intensity coffee cocoa double whammy drip feeding powdery iris mix like tip milk jug followed closely mocha almond creamer tonka bean move pure espresso territory creamy cocoa sprinkled milkiness cappuccino rich definitely sweet hint fiery cinnamon opoponax lending nubbin spice adds texture silken flow dash incense additionally lends interesting salt n pepper tartness stops gourmandise tracks still incredibly indulgent milano caffe tira mi su meaning 'pick up' italian adults room waiting,"coffee, cappuccino, chocolate, iris, woody notes, spicy notes, opoponax, tonka bean, amber"
Oakmoss Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Oakmoss (Quercia di Muschio) is deceptively named, because, despite the clear presence of oakmoss, this scent is far more about vetiver than moss. Still, the genius of the fragrance for us lies in the fact that Dominique Dubrana has obviously mined the areas of convergence between these two materials to emerge with a creature that has a foot in both worlds. Thus, the marine-like inkiness of the oakmoss connects with the rooty earthiness of vetiver via the crunch of sea salt and a shadowy 'forest floor' gloom. In the background, a dry, minimally smoky sandalwood provides a palette against which the notes of earth, grass, root, and lichen can really pop. Strangely, for a scent so heavily inspired by the elements of earth, grass, moss, and wood, Oakmoss is far more elegant and 'pulled together' than the kind of scent you'd throw on for a hike in the woods. In fact, its crisp, tailored lines make it a perfect candidate for formal office wear. But however you choose to use it, the fact remains that Oakmoss is a riveting distillation of everything rooty, wet, and green in the forest. We find it to be soul-restoring and exciting in equal measure.","vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oakmoss quercia di muschio deceptively named despite clear presence oakmoss scent far vetiver moss still genius fragrance us lies fact dominique dubrana obviously mined areas convergence two materials emerge creature foot worlds thus marine like inkiness oakmoss connects rooty earthiness vetiver via crunch sea salt shadowy 'forest floor' gloom background dry minimally smoky sandalwood provides palette notes earth grass root lichen really pop strangely scent heavily inspired elements earth grass moss wood oakmoss far elegant 'pulled together' kind scent throw hike woods fact crisp tailored lines make perfect candidate formal office wear however choose use fact remains oakmoss riveting distillation everything rooty wet green forest find soul restoring exciting equal measure,"vetiver, sandalwood, oakmoss"
Oud Caravan No. 1 Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection. Commissioned by an Arab customer to compose an oud perfume for the Gulf region, Dominique Dubrana decided to make it an open source project, enlisting the help of a group of oud connoisseurs on Basenotes.com to stress-test his offering. Oud Caravan No. 1 was originally intended to be the sole perfume in the endeavor  what Dubrana termed 'the Ultimate Oud Fragrance' but like a really good conversation with a circle of friends, nobody wanted it to end. Riffing off each other in endlessly creative ways, Dubrana harnessed the energy of the group to create the first, then second, and finally third Oud Caravan. Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.
Oud Caravan No. 1 was composed to provide the oud beginner with a primer on what the material actually smells like. To this end, the perfume amalgamates several key characteristics of different oud terroirs and blends them into a seamless whole to give the wearer an idea of the real deal, without compromising on wearability. In Oud Caravan No. 1, the camphoraceous, minty bite of a Borneo-style oud gives the opening a punchy freshness that contrasts delightfully with the animalistic warmth of the aged Indian oud that lies just beneath. Imagine a Bengali tiger and what he smells like: you sense the clean fur of the animal himself, but also the peppery heat of his breath and the dried-straw inkiness of his dung. Indian oud, especially the aged stuff, as used here, is the stuff of Kings - as noble as it is ferociously animalic. Spicy, masculine, and leathery are the three words we'd choose to describe this statement-making scent. Wear it to mark your territory.","natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series world's first probably crowd sourced oud perfume collection commissioned arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decided make open source project enlisting help group oud connoisseurs basenotes com stress test offering oud caravan originally intended sole perfume endeavor dubrana termed 'the ultimate oud fragrance' like really good conversation circle friends nobody wanted end riffing endlessly creative ways dubrana harnessed energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan composed provide oud beginner primer material actually smells like end perfume amalgamates several key characteristics different oud terroirs blends seamless whole give wearer idea real deal without compromising wearability oud caravan camphoraceous minty bite borneo style oud gives opening punchy freshness contrasts delightfully animalistic warmth aged indian oud lies beneath imagine bengali tiger smells like sense clean fur animal also peppery heat breath dried straw inkiness dung indian oud especially aged stuff used stuff kings noble ferociously animalic spicy masculine leathery three words we'd choose describe statement making scent wear mark territory,"natural aged oud oil, camphor, patchouli"
Oud Caravan No. 2 Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Abdes Salaam Attar's Oud Caravan series is the world's first (and probably only) crowd-sourced oud perfume collection.

Today, all three Oud Caravan perfumes fit together thematically and sequentially as a cohesive statement on the mysterious material that is oud oil.
Oud Caravan No. 2 was born out of the suggestions from Dubrana's testing group that No. 1 was simply too leathery, dry, and masculine to win over women. Dubrana listened carefully. After all, his avowed mission with Oud Caravan No. 1 had been to make The Ultimate Oud Fragrance that would sweep newcomers to oud oil, including women, off their feet and expose them to the glory of natural oud. Oud Caravan No. 2 handles the animalistic, barnyardy qualities of oud oil in a much lighter fashion, softening its leathery rudeness with an earthy vanilla and a subdued floral note, something creamy and pale like freshly-opened tuberose buds. The topnotes, similar to No. 1, open with a medicinal, stemmy freshness, which this time seems to come from tuberose rather than from Borneo oud. Although still unmistakably oudy, Oud Caravan No. 2 is an ethereal, dewy take on a famously gruff material â something that Arwen from Lord of The Rings might wear.","natural aged, wild oud oil, white flowers, oud oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81609.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series world's first probably crowd sourced oud perfume collection commissioned arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decided make open source project enlisting help group oud connoisseurs basenotes com stress test offering oud caravan originally intended sole perfume endeavor dubrana termed 'the ultimate oud fragrance' like really good conversation circle friends nobody wanted end riffing endlessly creative ways dubrana harnessed energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan born suggestions dubrana's testing group simply leathery dry masculine win women dubrana listened carefully avowed mission oud caravan make ultimate oud fragrance would sweep newcomers oud oil including women feet expose glory natural oud oud caravan handles animalistic barnyardy qualities oud oil much lighter fashion softening leathery rudeness earthy vanilla subdued floral note something creamy pale like freshly opened tuberose buds topnotes similar open medicinal stemmy freshness time seems come tuberose rather borneo oud although still unmistakably oudy oud caravan ethereal dewy take famously gruff material something arwen lord rings might wear,"natural aged, wild oud oil, white flowers, oud oil"

Oud Caravan No. 3 is the culmination of Dubrana's work on the Caravan series, and the version he feels best encapsulates his vision of a universally-pleasing oud scent. Removing the sharp camphoraceous topnotes that presaged both Caravan No. 1 and No. 2, Dubrana envelops the wild agarwood oil in a warm, fudgy date-like sweetness, using dried fruit and amber notes to subtly nudge the texture dial from leather to velvet. Rich and mellow, Oud Caravan No. 3 goes down smoothly, like a 50-year-old Scotch. Remarkably, Dubrana has steered the oudiness of this scent away from the jungly wetness of the first two scents and towards an airiness that feels like the windows being thrown open onto a closed-up room. As smoky as it is rich, Oud Caravan No. 3 is just animalic enough to remind you that you're wearing real oud, but smooth enough for you to enjoy it without the steep learning curve. As great for women as it is for men.","bergamot, pink pepper, rose de mai, hybrid tea rose, cedar, sandalwood, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,abdes salaam attar's oud caravan series world's first probably crowd sourced oud perfume collection commissioned arab customer compose oud perfume gulf region dominique dubrana decided make open source project enlisting help group oud connoisseurs basenotes com stress test offering oud caravan originally intended sole perfume endeavor dubrana termed 'the ultimate oud fragrance' like really good conversation circle friends nobody wanted end riffing endlessly creative ways dubrana harnessed energy group create first second finally third oud caravan today three oud caravan perfumes fit together thematically sequentially cohesive statement mysterious material oud oil oud caravan culmination dubrana's work caravan series version feels best encapsulates vision universally pleasing oud scent removing sharp camphoraceous topnotes presaged caravan dubrana envelops wild agarwood oil warm fudgy date like sweetness using dried fruit amber notes subtly nudge texture dial leather velvet rich mellow oud caravan goes smoothly like year old scotch remarkably dubrana steered oudiness scent away jungly wetness first two scents towards airiness feels like windows thrown open onto closed room smoky rich oud caravan animalic enough remind wearing real oud smooth enough enjoy without steep learning curve great women men,"bergamot, pink pepper, rose de mai, hybrid tea rose, cedar, sandalwood, oud"
Amber Chocolate Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Amber Chocolate is a lush gourmand amber that should come with a sticker that reads 'for grown-ups only'. Put aside any thoughts you might have of the kind of yummy vanilla-and-berries smell surrounding young girls like a nuclear cloud â this is seriously dark and sexy stuff. A molten dark chocolate note gets buffed out into an almondy haze of tonka bean, hints of hay and roast hazelnut flirting with the cacao to give it a slightly bitter, non-edible edge that sets it apart from other gourmands. The fact that this delicious scent is all-natural and artisanal means that it's a guilt-free indulgence. Despite the almost comically simple name, Amber Chocolate is not a simple affair. There's a naughty musk or patchouli here that gives the texture a resinous, grainy aftertaste, like gianduja rolled up in a veiny Cuban tobacco leaf. We think it's the real vanilla absolute that's been used in Amber Chocolate. Woody and resolutely non-sweet, it lends a boozy depth that reads in some lights as brandy or amaretto. Amber Chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes the golden sweetness of amber so effectively that even the amber-averse might be tempted. But honestly, if you ever loved or bought a bottle of Bruno Fazzolari's Ummagumma, Slumberhouse Ore, or Guerlain's Gourmand Coquin, then this boozy chocolate amber is 100% for you.","chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,amber chocolate lush gourmand amber come sticker reads 'for grown ups only' put aside thoughts might kind yummy vanilla berries smell surrounding young girls like nuclear cloud seriously dark sexy stuff molten dark chocolate note gets buffed almondy haze tonka bean hints hay roast hazelnut flirting cacao give slightly bitter non edible edge sets apart gourmands fact delicious scent natural artisanal means guilt free indulgence despite almost comically simple name amber chocolate simple affair there's naughty musk patchouli gives texture resinous grainy aftertaste like gianduja rolled veiny cuban tobacco leaf think real vanilla absolute that's used amber chocolate woody resolutely non sweet lends boozy depth reads lights brandy amaretto amber chocolate's bitter cacao juxtaposes golden sweetness amber effectively even amber averse might tempted honestly ever loved bought bottle bruno fazzolari's ummagumma slumberhouse ore guerlain's gourmand coquin boozy chocolate amber,"chocolate, tonka bean, vanilla"
Hindu Kush Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Hindu Kush takes its name and inspiration from the 500-mile mountain range running along the hinterlands of Afghanistan, Kashmir, and Pakistan, characterized by wild pine forests that give way to jagged mountain peaks. The scent mirrors the sensory contrast between forest and stone to perfection, capturing in particular the chilly isolation of rugged places unreachable to most humans. It is a meditative scent that taps into our need for silence and contemplation. The contrasts in Hindu Kush are what drive the scent. In pairing the cool lemon-and-pine notes of pure frankincense with the fiery heat of ginger, nutmeg, and pepper, Hindu Kush achieves an incredible fire-and-ice character that captures our interest throughout. Resinous, mossy woods create the impression of oiled floorboards, a smell that is both comforting and nostalgic. The incense notes are smoky and balsamic, but the freshness of pine leaves drags the priest's censer out of the chapel and into the forest clearing. It's a scent of worship, yes, but here we're worshipping at the altar of Nature herself. Picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat over fires, surrounded by the howling ice winds of the Hindu Kush, and you get an idea of the mysterious alchemy between the culinary and the spiritual at play here. We can think of nothing quite like it.","spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hindu kush takes name inspiration mile mountain range running along hinterlands afghanistan kashmir pakistan characterized wild pine forests give way jagged mountain peaks scent mirrors sensory contrast forest stone perfection capturing particular chilly isolation rugged places unreachable humans meditative scent taps need silence contemplation contrasts hindu kush drive scent pairing cool lemon pine notes pure frankincense fiery heat ginger nutmeg pepper hindu kush achieves incredible fire ice character captures interest throughout resinous mossy woods create impression oiled floorboards smell comforting nostalgic incense notes smoky balsamic freshness pine leaves drags priest's censer chapel forest clearing scent worship yes we're worshipping altar nature picture ancient warriors cooking heavily spiced meat fires surrounded howling ice winds hindu kush get idea mysterious alchemy culinary spiritual play think nothing quite like,"spice, woody notes, incense, ginger, caraway, nutmeg, pepper"
Aenotus Parfum Extrait,Puredistance,"On a rocky bluff at the edge of the mythical isle of Aeolia, a mythic God tends to the divine winds. At a moment's notice, he is ready to release them in all their elemental force, to sweep across the lands of ancient Europe, carrying in their embrace the contrasting powers of creation and destruction. This is the power of Aenotus, itself a fragrance of contrast: freshness and warmth, comfort and primal power. While Puredistance founder Jan Ewoud Vos has a personal connection to every scent, Aenotus was conceived to be his signature- a scent that had to be instantly refreshing, while also presenting a rich, long-lasting second phase more sophisticated than your average ""fresh"" scent. And with the help of master perfumer Antoine Lie, Aenotus delivers, wowing us with an eye-popping, euphoric burst of complex citrus and mint notes that smoothly flows into a warm, deeply sensual base of mossy skin musk that lingers on skin for hours and clothes for days. This rare achievement is possible via Puredistance's no-matter-the-cost philosophy, as Aenotus boasts an astounding, unprecedented 48% perfume oil concentration developed over three painstaking years. Was it worth it? Close your eyes, spray it on, and when your feet finally touch the ground again, decide for yourself.","orange, mandarin, lemon, yuzu, mint, blackcurrant bud, petitgrain, oakmoss, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rocky bluff edge mythical isle aeolia mythic god tends divine winds moment's notice ready release elemental force sweep across lands ancient europe carrying embrace contrasting powers creation destruction power aenotus fragrance contrast freshness warmth comfort primal power puredistance founder jan ewoud vos personal connection every scent aenotus conceived signature scent instantly refreshing also presenting rich long lasting second phase sophisticated average fresh scent help master perfumer antoine lie aenotus delivers wowing us eye popping euphoric burst complex citrus mint notes smoothly flows warm deeply sensual base mossy skin musk lingers skin hours clothes days rare achievement possible via puredistance's matter cost philosophy aenotus boasts astounding unprecedented perfume oil concentration developed three painstaking years worth close eyes spray feet finally touch ground decide,"orange, mandarin, lemon, yuzu, mint, blackcurrant bud, petitgrain, oakmoss, patchouli, musk"
Tabac Eau de Parfum,La Via Del Profumo,"Tobacco fragrances often get the 'weight' thing wrong. Too much amber or vanilla, and it sinks under the heft of its own richness, but too light and it feels like a sheer wash of ash on the skin. Tabac by Abdes Salaam Attar gets it right by pairing a bold tobacco leaf with a sheer dried-fruit amber and a bitter, earthy vanilla - elements that serve to modulate each other's behavior and sidestep any excessive sweetness. The tobacco leaf in Tabac is raw and uncured, even a bit rough around the edges. Its honest-to-goodness rustic charm is complemented by the quasi-animalic woodiness of sticky black vanilla pod and the buttery, cherry-almond bitterness of tonka bean. As you might imagine, the result is incredibly rich. But fear not! The resinous amber underpinning the tobacco, vanilla, and tonka bean crown is so dry that there's no danger of this tipping over into syrup. Tabac is simply vigorous, handsome, and very well-built. It's the perfect mid-weight tobacco perfume: substantial enough to be satisfying and spacious enough to wear without feeling crushed under the weight of super-rich materials. In a word â suave.","tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/81607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tobacco fragrances often get 'weight' thing wrong much amber vanilla sinks heft richness light feels like sheer wash ash skin tabac abdes salaam attar gets right pairing bold tobacco leaf sheer dried fruit amber bitter earthy vanilla elements serve modulate other's behavior sidestep excessive sweetness tobacco leaf tabac raw uncured even bit rough around edges honest goodness rustic charm complemented quasi animalic woodiness sticky black vanilla pod buttery cherry almond bitterness tonka bean might imagine result incredibly rich fear resinous amber underpinning tobacco vanilla tonka bean crown dry there's danger tipping syrup tabac simply vigorous handsome well built perfect mid weight tobacco perfume substantial enough satisfying spacious enough wear without feeling crushed weight super rich materials word suave,"tobacco, vanilla, tonka bean, labdanum, spicy notes, resins"
Molecule 03 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"As with the first two pairs, launched in 2006 and 2008, Schoen has designed two new scents as homages to a single scent ingredient, or aroma-chemical. What Molecule 01 did for ISO E Super and Molecule 02 did for Ambroxan, Molecule 03 does for vetiveryle acetate.
Ultimate is an overused word. Some bandy it about, announcing that something or other is the ultimate sports car, the ultimate cabernet, the ultimate restaurant. However, we can with confidence write that Molecule 03 is the ultimate vetiver. The aroma-chemical in Molecule 03 is vetiveryle acetate, a stark, clinical name for a vetiver note which is celebrated in its purest form in this fragrance. Amazingly, this single note runs the gamut of all aspects of vetiver. Molecule 03 opens with a heady, sparkling brightness that develops into a rooty earthiness. As it melts into your skin, it contrasts with the slightly sweet and very green heart that is a hallmark of this perennial grass native to India. It has that yin and yang of cold and hot; it's a skin scent with a sly sillage. Were it jewelry it would be a single, flawless emerald in a simple platinum setting, a thing of beauty and perhaps the most perfect vetiver you've ever experienced.

Escentric 03 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Escentric 03 is a tribute to the more familiar side of vetiver: its dark, slightly exotic woodiness. The fragrance opens with a burst of freshness âÂ the ginger root is joined by top notes of green peppercorn and Mexican lime.
The heart of orris is surrounded by Egyptian jasmine and soft tea notes. Then, at the base of the fragrance, the slightly bitter notes of vetiver are smoothed by rich amber shades of sandalwood, cedar, leather and musk.
The overall impression is spicy but fresh with warm balsamic undertones, like a traditional chypre. It's sensuous without sweetness, which is a signature by perfumer Geza Schoen. And, because he also excels at unexpected associations, you may even detect a fugitive tang of ginger ale.","green notes, lime, mandarine, pink pepper, black pepper, ginger, freesia, rose, hedione (green jasmine bud), jasmin, orris, cinnamon, tonka, vetiver, sandalwood, iso e super, leather, musk, amber, costus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30809.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,escentric tribute familiar side vetiver dark slightly exotic woodiness fragrance opens burst freshness ginger root joined top notes green peppercorn mexican lime heart orris surrounded egyptian jasmine soft tea notes base fragrance slightly bitter notes vetiver smoothed rich amber shades sandalwood cedar leather musk overall impression spicy fresh warm balsamic undertones like traditional chypre sensuous without sweetness signature perfumer geza schoen also excels unexpected associations may even detect fugitive tang ginger ale,"green notes, lime, mandarine, pink pepper, black pepper, ginger, freesia, rose, hedione (green jasmine bud), jasmin, orris, cinnamon, tonka, vetiver, sandalwood, iso e super, leather, musk, amber, costus"

Cuir Mauresque Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Each release of Serge Lutens' Palais-Royale exclusives into the export line is an eagerly awaited event and with this season's Cuir Mauresque, aficionados will, at last, be able to revel in the definitive Oriental leather, in the line of Caron's mythical Tabac Blond with spices added.
This isn't the tough, rawhide pungency rising from Marrakech tanneries, but the smoothest, fatty-rich leather rubbed in flowers and a sweet spice blend of cinnamon, nutmeg, cumin and clove infused with the fragrant smoke of incense and myrrh rising from censers. Sweetened by orange blossom, mandarin peel and amber, Cuir Mauresque gives off a tawny, ember-like glow. The leather accord itself is produced by burnt styrax, a balsamic material with tarry, animalic facets; clove, incense and aloe wood add a dark, burnt edginess to the accord, while civet pulls it towards the animal.
With its spiced dried fruit accord, resins and white flowers, Cuir Mauresque, originally launched in 1996, is perhaps the quintessential Lutens: the master himself has gone on record saying he doused himself in on the rare occasions when he goes out. And considering the choice he's got, that's saying quite a lot. What We Think Spicy, powdery, and animalic, this is a delightfully sexy secret weapon of a fragrance.","amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36140.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,release serge lutens' palais royale exclusives export line eagerly awaited event season's cuir mauresque aficionados last able revel definitive oriental leather line caron's mythical tabac blond spices added tough rawhide pungency rising marrakech tanneries smoothest fatty rich leather rubbed flowers sweet spice blend cinnamon nutmeg cumin clove infused fragrant smoke incense myrrh rising censers sweetened orange blossom mandarin peel amber cuir mauresque gives tawny ember like glow leather accord produced burnt styrax balsamic material tarry animalic facets clove incense aloe wood add dark burnt edginess accord civet pulls towards animal spiced dried fruit accord resins white flowers cuir mauresque originally launched perhaps quintessential lutens master gone record saying doused rare occasions goes considering choice he's got that's saying quite lot think spicy powdery animalic delightfully sexy secret weapon fragrance,"amber, myrrh, burnt styrax, incense, cinnamon, aloe wood, cedar, civet, nutmeg, clove, cumin, musk, mandarin peel, orange blossom"
Chene Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"If you thought the oak, beeswax and rum notes would take you in Uncle Serge's secret Western-style den â the one with the polished heirloom furniture where he trades mint tea for a tipple â you'd be very much mistaken... Chene is quintessentially Lutens: dried fruit, spices and wood.
In Chene (French for oak), each note seems to mesh with the others to create a flammable mixture drenched in woody saps and resins... The fruity booziness of the oak, rum and immortelle segues, through the latter's tobacco and honey notes, into the beeswax and tonka bean. The smokiness of the tonka bean echoes that of the birch tar and oak. The bone-dry, pencil-shavings cedar is suffused with the aromatic camphor of the black thyme and the underlying bitterness of the oak tannins is nestled in an undergrowth note which chypre aficionados will recognize as... oak moss. In fact, Chene is probably the closest Serge Lutens and Christopher Sheldrake have come to composing an aromatic leather chypre, in their trademark oriental-style. What We Think Rich, woodsy, and delightfully long lasting, this is a masterpiece for any cedar lovers.","cedar crystals, wood sap, black thyme, oak, immortelle, beeswax, silver birch, rum absolute tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36129.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,thought oak beeswax rum notes would take uncle serge's secret western style den one polished heirloom furniture trades mint tea tipple much mistaken chene quintessentially lutens dried fruit spices wood chene french oak note seems mesh others create flammable mixture drenched woody saps resins fruity booziness oak rum immortelle segues latter's tobacco honey notes beeswax tonka bean smokiness tonka bean echoes birch tar oak bone dry pencil shavings cedar suffused aromatic camphor black thyme underlying bitterness oak tannins nestled undergrowth note chypre aficionados recognize oak moss fact chene probably closest serge lutens christopher sheldrake come composing aromatic leather chypre trademark oriental style think rich woodsy delightfully long lasting masterpiece cedar lovers,"cedar crystals, wood sap, black thyme, oak, immortelle, beeswax, silver birch, rum absolute tonka bean"
Fumerie Turque Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"An eagerly-awaited inclusion in the exports line (aren't they all?), Fumerie Turque evocatively weaves references to the honeyed tobaccos smoked in the seraglios of the Ottoman empire and the exotic cigarettes flaunted by the Garconnes in the gender-bending 1920s. It can't be too much of a stretch to envision Fumerie Turque as Serge Lutens' tribute to Caron's trailblazing Tabac Blond, albeit with his trademark Oriental twist.
Smokey wisps of honeyed, fruity tobacco rise from a smooth, vanilla-flavored blend of tonka bean, styrax and Peru balsam, conjuring lazy winter afternoons smoking a hookah and nibbling rose-scented Turkish delights in a leather-paneled room. The rich, floral, faintly animal odor of beeswax rises from floors strewn with ornate rugs and polished daybeds. The scent of late-blooming jasmine wafts up from the palace gardens. Through the intricate wooden lace of a musharabieh, the Bosphorus glints in the sunset. Intoxicating and comforting, Fumerie Turque is the ultimate Orientalist reverie in a bottle. Succumb. What We Think Sweet, fresh pipe tobacco with surprisingly lush florals- a truly romantic unisex tobacco scent.","corinthian raisins, white honey, candied rose, jasmine, smoked leather, beeswax, balkan tobacco, balsam, patchouli, tonka bean, styrax, juniper tar oil",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36130.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,eagerly awaited inclusion exports line fumerie turque evocatively weaves references honeyed tobaccos smoked seraglios ottoman empire exotic cigarettes flaunted garconnes gender bending can't much stretch envision fumerie turque serge lutens' tribute caron's trailblazing tabac blond albeit trademark oriental twist smokey wisps honeyed fruity tobacco rise smooth vanilla flavored blend tonka bean styrax peru balsam conjuring lazy winter afternoons smoking hookah nibbling rose scented turkish delights leather paneled room rich floral faintly animal odor beeswax rises floors strewn ornate rugs polished daybeds scent late blooming jasmine wafts palace gardens intricate wooden lace musharabieh bosphorus glints sunset intoxicating comforting fumerie turque ultimate orientalist reverie bottle succumb think sweet fresh pipe tobacco surprisingly lush florals truly romantic unisex tobacco scent,"corinthian raisins, white honey, candied rose, jasmine, smoked leather, beeswax, balkan tobacco, balsam, patchouli, tonka bean, styrax, juniper tar oil"

Koublai Khan, the Great Mongol ruler, Emperor of China. This Son of Heaven had a hill raised in the grounds of his palace, on top of which stood a lacquer and jade contemplation pavilion.

Tubereuse Criminelle Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"At last, Serge Lutens' mythical Tubereuse Criminelle makes a break from the Palais Royal in this season's limited edition!
Its surprisingly addictive minty-camphoraceous top notes are due to the Tiger Balm-ish smell of methyl salicylate, a molecule naturally present in the tuberose... Instead of taming their fierceness, Serge Lutens asked the perfumer Christopher Sheldrake to unleash it. But after this olfactory assault, the tuberose opens up its creamy heart, made richer still with its white floral sisters jasmine and orange blossom, contrasted with the green-rosy, indolic notes of hyacinth. A rich oriental base anchors it to the skin, the styrax underlining the almost leathery undertones of the tuberose, nutmeg and clove boosting its slow burn...
Thus, the diva of the garden lives up to her reputation: first a slap, then a kiss... The rest, we'll leave entirely up to you. What We Think A dynamically minty take on tuberose for all the camphor lovers out there.","tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, hyacinth, nutmeg, clove, styrax, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,last serge lutens' mythical tubereuse criminelle makes break palais royal season's limited edition surprisingly addictive minty camphoraceous top notes due tiger balm ish smell methyl salicylate molecule naturally present tuberose instead taming fierceness serge lutens asked perfumer christopher sheldrake unleash olfactory assault tuberose opens creamy heart made richer still white floral sisters jasmine orange blossom contrasted green rosy indolic notes hyacinth rich oriental base anchors skin styrax underlining almost leathery undertones tuberose nutmeg clove boosting slow burn thus diva garden lives reputation first slap kiss rest we'll leave entirely think dynamically minty take tuberose camphor lovers,"tuberose, jasmine, orange blossom, hyacinth, nutmeg, clove, styrax, musk, vanilla"

Louve Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens,"The newest Lutens creation, Louve, is the softest, gentlest, perhaps the most loveable of the entire line. It is a lunar scent, quiet and tranquil...tender like baby's breath, soft like the white fur of a mythical She-Wolf...The almond and rose petals accord, the center of the composition, is bound to satisfy the cravings of those who love loukhoum-inspired scents. Those who tend to avoid gourmand compositions because of their overwhelming sweetness, should, however, give Louve a serious try. This understated, only subtly sweet, sublimely elegant blend will change your mind. The slight powderiness of vanilla and amber, combined with the floral heart, gives Louve an enchantingly retro feel, making us think of expensive lipsticks of the days past, of the finest of face powders and of utter refinement.

De Profundis Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"From the depths, I have cried out to you, O Lord! Inspired in part by Psalm 130, De Profundis is a love poem to resurrection, both of the soul and of nature. This fragrance opens on a thrilling note of new plant growth pushing rudely through wet soil, ripping its way into the weak sunshine. A haze of violets, chrysanthemums, muguet, and hyacinth chills the wearer like a dawn mist, creating a floral harmony so beautiful and so delicate that one is afraid it will collapse at any moment.
It doesn't. The metallic, green, and watery aromas of emerging plant life are grounded by the earthier, velvety notes of soil and violet petals. The end result is a perfume that manages to suggest new life while remaining ever so slightly wistful and melancholic in tone. In the base, the ethereal florals are wreathed in smoke, incense, and earth, a reminder of our own eventual return to the ground.
Serge Lutens' exclusive Palais Royal line is now available in a travel atomizer set that includes a metal case, two 30ml refills (for a total of 60ml of juice), and a funnel.

Molecule 04 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Following on in the Escentric Moleculesâ tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the âmeatâ of a fragrance, Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol, a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen, this could have been a disaster â Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is, well, too much.
But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy, creamy, and steamy, tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward, and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light, almost fresh, with a green âstripped barkâ note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness,â says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree, adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin, giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.",javanol,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30850.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,following escentric molecules tradition focusing one modern synthetics meat fragrance molecule focuses entirely javanol powerful givaudan sandalwood synthetic replaces natural sandalwood oil hands anyone else geza schoen could disaster javanol potent even touch much well much triumph schoen deployed natural deftness touch ensure rosy creamy steamy tropical facets javanol brought forward heaviness left behind feels light almost fresh green stripped bark note brings element great outdoors love javanol almost psychedelic freshness says geza schoen smells liquid metal grapefruit peel poured bed velvety cream colored roses agree adding fragrance whose subtle power radiance best perceived sillage rather directly skin giving personal invisible cloak gorgeousness,javanol
Escentric 04 Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to The Beautiful Mind series, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes â and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty, whiteness that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer 'my skin but better' scent for both men and women.","javanol, mastic, labdanum, iso e super, musk, ambroxan, hedione (green jasmine bud), freesia, osmanthus, orris, rose, methyl pamplemousse, pink grapefruit, marijuana, bergamot, juniper berry, pink pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30851.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,escentric geza schoen familiar perfumer's work escentric molecule anat fritz beautiful mind series know mean compliment escentric contains schoen's signature turning heavy materials like woods gauzy air bound creations thoughtful use modern synthetics like iso e super ambroxan unlike perfumers use materials simply boost radiance projection schoen uses main building blocks entire perfumes escentric evidence brilliant escentric schoen chosen focus synthetic sandalwood javanol powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood polysantol sweeter creamier use much either scent become loud vulgar schoen woven fizzing pink combo grapefruit rose pink pepper sandalwood resulting light creamy shimmer woods never overpowers hedione ambroxan add fresh salty whiteness illuminates woods within nothing overdosed harsh perfect balance sparkling fruit roses salt flowers creamy woods spanking freshness wet laundry ultimate summer 'my skin better' scent men women,"javanol, mastic, labdanum, iso e super, musk, ambroxan, hedione (green jasmine bud), freesia, osmanthus, orris, rose, methyl pamplemousse, pink grapefruit, marijuana, bergamot, juniper berry, pink pepper"
Sorong Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","Inspired by the smooth, contemplative smoke of olibanum incense and the bright, luminous smoke of Indonesian kyara wood oud chips, Sorong is a grand vision of a mystical plane where the spiritual and supernatural collide. Centered around the ""animalized smoke"" accord created by this awe-inspiring combination- woody and spicy, with deep tones of amber- Sorong leads off with an energizing burst of citrus, spice, and blackcurrant, immediately elevating the fragrance with an airy yet substantial jolt of sophisticated energy and setting the stage for the vividly smoky, yet ultra-refined heart notes. Together, the potency of these materials is undeniable, and yet the effect is soothing, lending the wearer an aura of deep calm and protection. As it dries, a smouldering sexiness reasserts itself in the form of ambered musks which coax the animalism from the oud and incense with undeniable power. Like kyara itself, Sorong is a rare treasure, and a fragrance to savor.","citrus, saffron, blackcurrant, kyara, olibanum, amber, animalic musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34555.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired smooth contemplative smoke olibanum incense bright luminous smoke indonesian kyara wood oud chips sorong grand vision mystical plane spiritual supernatural collide centered around animalized smoke accord created awe inspiring combination woody spicy deep tones amber sorong leads energizing burst citrus spice blackcurrant immediately elevating fragrance airy yet substantial jolt sophisticated energy setting stage vividly smoky yet ultra refined heart notes together potency materials undeniable yet effect soothing lending wearer aura deep calm protection dries smouldering sexiness reasserts form ambered musks coax animalism oud incense undeniable power like kyara sorong rare treasure fragrance savor,"citrus, saffron, blackcurrant, kyara, olibanum, amber, animalic musk"
Chronic Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""In 1996, California became the first state in the US to legalize medical cannabis. But scratch the surface and there has always been a long history of cannabis cultivators and enthusiasts dedicating their lives to refining the herb. Chronic is a term for Cannabis and also alludes to 'The Chronic' - the debut album of Dr Dre. The Chronic was released in 1992, the same year as the Los Angeles riots."" -Johan Bergerlin

But rather than a straightforward reproduction of a bag of trees- after all, we can already get that out here- Chronic is a delightfully artistic reconstruction of the experience- from the sharply bitter citrus of the opening, to the dank green herbaceousness of clary sage, to a smokey twinge of vetiver. There's a naturalistic cannabis note in here too, but it emerges towards the end, bringing each note that preceded it together in a grand bouquet of, well, dankness. Take it from us- Chronic is the real stuff.","petitgrain, bitter orange, bitter grapefruit, russian clary sage, cedarwood, cannabis accord, amber, patchouli, vetiver, cashmere wood, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,california became first state us legalize medical cannabis scratch surface always long history cannabis cultivators enthusiasts dedicating lives refining herb chronic term cannabis also alludes 'the chronic' debut album dr dre chronic released year los angeles riots johan bergerlin eye openingly fresh soothingly green numbingly sticky chronic everything cali weed scent rather straightforward reproduction bag trees already get chronic delightfully artistic reconstruction experience sharply bitter citrus opening dank green herbaceousness clary sage smokey twinge vetiver there's naturalistic cannabis note emerges towards end bringing note preceded together grand bouquet well dankness take us chronic real stuff,"petitgrain, bitter orange, bitter grapefruit, russian clary sage, cedarwood, cannabis accord, amber, patchouli, vetiver, cashmere wood, moss, musk"
Capri Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""I have always been captivated by legendary, trendsetting films. The movie Le MÃ©pris from 1963 featuring Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance is both iconic and stylish. The fragrance of Capri reflects the ambience of the movie. There are elements of wild citrus trees, orange blossoms, green olive groves, blue skies and the endless ocean that encircles the island."" -Johan Bergelin
Inspired by the settings of Villa Malaparte and the iconic Godard film Le MÃ©pris, Capri is an eye-poppingly colorful journey. From the very first spray, Capri explodes with enchantingly bright aromas of blossoming orange trees, mandarin leaves and elements of the blue skies and endless ocean that encircle the island. Edgy but fresh, light but comforting, it's a stunning tribute to the rugged yet luxurious paradise on the Tyrrhenian Sea.","mandora, bitter orange, sweet orange, chamomile, cardamom, pink pepper, sichuan pepper, juniper berries, mandarine oil, mandarine leaves oil, grapefruit, galbanum, jasmine, osmanthus, ylang-ylang, orris, ambroxan, angelica seeds, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,always captivated legendary trendsetting films movie le pris featuring brigitte bardot jack palance iconic stylish fragrance capri reflects ambience movie elements wild citrus trees orange blossoms green olive groves blue skies endless ocean encircles island johan bergelin inspired settings villa malaparte iconic godard film le pris capri eye poppingly colorful journey first spray capri explodes enchantingly bright aromas blossoming orange trees mandarin leaves elements blue skies endless ocean encircle island edgy fresh light comforting stunning tribute rugged yet luxurious paradise tyrrhenian sea,"mandora, bitter orange, sweet orange, chamomile, cardamom, pink pepper, sichuan pepper, juniper berries, mandarine oil, mandarine leaves oil, grapefruit, galbanum, jasmine, osmanthus, ylang-ylang, orris, ambroxan, angelica seeds, white musk"
Chinese Tobacco Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""There are elements of different legendary movies like Indochine in the fragrance Chinese Tobacco. A reflection of East meets West taking place in the 30's to 50's colonial French Indochina. I'm often captured by these strong contrasts and different ambiances when travelling in Asia. The old and the new. A major influence for the scent was the powerful scene in the movie 'Apocalypse Now' featuring Aurore Clement and Martin Sheen smoking opium."" Johan Bergelin
Exotic, hypnotic, and more than a little dangerous, Chinese Tobacco is not your typically buttoned-up European tobacco scent. Fiery red pepper and coriander ignite the senses, while incense and oud add unexpected subtlety and a gently narcotic haze. Spicy and woodsy, primal and modern, Chinese Tobacco is a gripping study of East meets West.","bergamot, tobacco, red pepper, lemon, ginger, coriander, incense, cedarwood, vanilla, tar, oud, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,elements different legendary movies like indochine fragrance chinese tobacco reflection east meets west taking place 's 's colonial french indochina i'm often captured strong contrasts different ambiances travelling asia old new major influence scent powerful scene movie 'apocalypse now' featuring aurore clement martin sheen smoking opium johan bergelin exotic hypnotic little dangerous chinese tobacco typically buttoned european tobacco scent fiery red pepper coriander ignite senses incense oud add unexpected subtlety gently narcotic haze spicy woodsy primal modern chinese tobacco gripping study east meets west,"bergamot, tobacco, red pepper, lemon, ginger, coriander, incense, cedarwood, vanilla, tar, oud, vetiver"
Kasbah Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""Stories of how personalities like Talitha and Paul Getty, Paul Bowles, Mick Jagger, Veruschka and Yves Saint Laurent all resided in Marrakech during the 60s and 70s have always inspired me. I'm intrigued by how they used this place for influences and escapes of all kinds: clothes, colours, music, interior and drugs. So, the fragrance of Kasbah is an appreciation to the international party scene during this era."" -Johan Bergelin
Woody, welcoming, drenched in the soothing orange tones of a desert sunset, Kasbah is a hazy journey to the outer reaches of culture and consciousness. Opening with a sweet, zesty burst of citrus and honey, the shifting sands soon uncover dusty, warm geranium and delicately spiced amber. As the sun sets, casting an ever-more-auburn glow over clay walls, we smell the smooth, soothing combination of leather, tonka, and soft woods. It's a trip- in more ways than one.","sweet orange, lime, white honey, geranium, amber, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, guaiac wood, leather accord, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,stories personalities like talitha paul getty paul bowles mick jagger veruschka yves saint laurent resided marrakech always inspired i'm intrigued used place influences escapes kinds clothes colours music interior drugs fragrance kasbah appreciation international party scene era johan bergelin woody welcoming drenched soothing orange tones desert sunset kasbah hazy journey outer reaches culture consciousness opening sweet zesty burst citrus honey shifting sands soon uncover dusty warm geranium delicately spiced amber sun sets casting ever auburn glow clay walls smell smooth soothing combination leather tonka soft woods trip ways one,"sweet orange, lime, white honey, geranium, amber, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, guaiac wood, leather accord, sandalwood"
Rainbow Bar Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""The notorious Rainbow Bar on Sunset Strip was founded when the word ""rainbow"" signified peace and freedom. Think Pamela Courson, sex, drugs and rock and roll. But there are also the other lighter dimensions like the sun, the blue skies and warm glow that embrace LA. As the lyrics in the famous song by America go: 'Driving on Ventura Highway, the free wind blowing through your hair.' It's all been captured in the fragrance Rainbow Bar."" -Johan Bergelin
Los Angeles during the glam rock era, in a wickedly smooth and spicy fragrance cocktail: that's the good-to-the-last-drop appeal of Rainbow Bar. A brightly bitter, herbaceous first taste of davana and wormwood goes down like a shot of Jager, while soothingly spicy cardamom, nutmeg, clove, and cypress keep the high alive. The woodsy base is rich, but soft, letting the spices sing all night long. With all the purring, shimmying sex appeal of feathered hair, eyeliner, and a leather jumpsuit, Rainbow Bar's got what it takes to keep the party rocking through last call.","davana, bergamot, cypress, wormwood, cardamom, marine accord, basil, elemi, artemisia, grape seed, bourbon, nutmeg, vetiver, clove, guaiac wood, cedarwood, pimento seeds",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,notorious rainbow bar sunset strip founded word rainbow signified peace freedom think pamela courson sex drugs rock roll also lighter dimensions like sun blue skies warm glow embrace la lyrics famous song america go 'driving ventura highway free wind blowing hair ' captured fragrance rainbow bar johan bergelin los angeles glam rock era wickedly smooth spicy fragrance cocktail that's good last drop appeal rainbow bar brightly bitter herbaceous first taste davana wormwood goes like shot jager soothingly spicy cardamom nutmeg clove cypress keep high alive woodsy base rich soft letting spices sing night long purring shimmying sex appeal feathered hair eyeliner leather jumpsuit rainbow bar's got takes keep party rocking last call,"davana, bergamot, cypress, wormwood, cardamom, marine accord, basil, elemi, artemisia, grape seed, bourbon, nutmeg, vetiver, clove, guaiac wood, cedarwood, pimento seeds"
L'air Barbes Eau de Parfum,19-69,"""I was in my teens when I first discovered Helmut NewtonÂ´s picture that made YSLÂ´s Le Smoking iconic. The genderlessness really made a big impression on me. With stark monochrome simplicity, Newton created a piece of iconography I still find myself influenced by. In the making of LÂ´air BarbÃ¨s I was strongly influenced by the androgyny in this picture."" -Johan Bergelin
Cold and fresh, L'Air Barbes is a tribute to Paris, capital de la mode. Evocative of Parisâ different personas such as the concrete alleyways, le banlieue and the area BarbÃ¨s-Rochechouart, the fragrance sings of chilled aldehydes, wet stone, and smooth, rich orris. Modern, yet timeless, just like the City of Lights itself.","aldehydes, fresh lemon, bergamot, concrete, ylang-ylang, tuberose, ambroxan, orris, cumin seeds, ink, leather, dry woods, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/812005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,teens first discovered helmut newton picture made ysl le smoking iconic genderlessness really made big impression stark monochrome simplicity newton created piece iconography still find influenced making l air barb strongly influenced androgyny picture johan bergelin cold fresh l'air barbes tribute paris capital de la mode evocative paris different personas concrete alleyways le banlieue area barb rochechouart fragrance sings chilled aldehydes wet stone smooth rich orris modern yet timeless like city lights,"aldehydes, fresh lemon, bergamot, concrete, ylang-ylang, tuberose, ambroxan, orris, cumin seeds, ink, leather, dry woods, white musk"
Gris Clair Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Gris Clair, Lutens's ode to lavender, evokes in our minds the image of a cool flame...a strange, otherworldly flame that illuminates but doesn't warm and doesn't burn if you touch it. The wonderfully refined, complex and beautifully ethereal creation beings with a chilly, shimmery, definitely 'gray' lavender note. The contrast of the cold lavender and the sweeter, warmer blend of amber and tonka bean in the middle stage is incredibly appealing. Our favorite part of Gris Clair are the elegantly charred, smoky base notes of dry wood and burned incense. The darker accord gives Gris Clair an infinite depth and the exotic, opulent feel that we came to associate with the best Lutens's creations. The chilly lavender, the honeyed amber, the gently smoldering ashes of precious woods and incense create a unique, harmonious and striking, fusion of darkness and luminosity. Absolutely exquisite.","lavender, amber, tonka bean, iris, dry wood, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gris clair lutens's ode lavender evokes minds image cool flame strange otherworldly flame illuminates warm burn touch wonderfully refined complex beautifully ethereal creation beings chilly shimmery definitely 'gray' lavender note contrast cold lavender sweeter warmer blend amber tonka bean middle stage incredibly appealing favorite part gris clair elegantly charred smoky base notes dry wood burned incense darker accord gives gris clair infinite depth exotic opulent feel came associate best lutens's creations chilly lavender honeyed amber gently smoldering ashes precious woods incense create unique harmonious striking fusion darkness luminosity absolutely exquisite,"lavender, amber, tonka bean, iris, dry wood, incense"
Fleurs de Citronnier Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"The effect of beautiful simplicity is perhaps the hardest to achieve in perfume. Make it too straightforward and the scent becomes boring, complicate the composition, and the delicate beauty of the star notes becomes obscured. With Fleurs de Citronnier, Serge Lutens shows us how it's done, presenting the fragrance of classical simplicity, a harmonious, uncluttered blend which allows the radiant beauty of the ingredients to shine. Lemon blossom, neroli and tuberose form a delightfully pure and fresh accord, evocative of a breezy summer day...a romantic stroll in a Mediterranean garden, under the blossoming lemon and orange trees...A subtle musk note in the base grounds and rounds the scent, adding a sensual touch to the beautifully ethereal flowers.

L'Homme Aux Gants Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"A masterpiece of Italian Renaissance portraiture, Titien's Man With A Glove is renowned for the complexity of its subject, whose facial expression and hand placement suggest preoccupations far beyond the triviality of the idle rich. How appropriate, then, that L'Homme Aux Gants turns out to be a fragrance with a commensurate depth beneath the surface- a nuanced, sophisticated blend of oudh, spice, and woods designed for a gentleman who knows he's defined by more than the clothes he wears. L'Homme Aux Gants arrives on a wave of sweet, gently energetic Indonesian nutmeg, building into a warm, rugged heart of earthy cypriol and sensual hedione. But it's in the quietly powerful base that L'Homme Aux Gants truly comes to life, blending a soft, smooth oudh note with a rich melange of resins, woods, patchouli, and vanilla, creating a soothing yet complex aura that lingers for hours.

Impossibly juicy bergamot and electric green notes open the scent in full swing, while a deliciously fruity heart really separates Bleu Satin from its cohort, with sweet, intoxicating cassis and mouthwatering watermelon set against a hypnotically lush jasmine- fresh and elegant in equal measure.

Cuir Cavalier Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Gericault's Charging Chasseur, his first exhibited work, already demonstrated the artist's impressive talent for subverting the tropes of convention (in this case the heroic portrait of a Napoleonic cavalryman) in the service of creating a more complex, challenging narrative. It's the perfect inspiration for Cuir Cavalier, a richly spiced oud and leather scent that nods to the heavyweights of the smoky leather category while carving out a smooth, sophisticated niche all its own. Cuir Cavalier opens bright and fiery, with a crisp Italian red tangerine paired with a luscious saffron, leading into a rich floral leather heart. A warm, powerful base of oud and vanilla hums beautifully, a perfect chord with the still potent thread of saffron that continues to elevate the entire composition with a poised masculine gracefulness. Like a masterpiece that presents an iconic image in a way you've never before seen, Cuir Cavalier is a bold new portrait of a classic concept.","red tangerine, saffron, rose, iris, cypriol, white honey, oud, soft leather, cedar, tonka bean, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36524.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gericault's charging chasseur first exhibited work already demonstrated artist's impressive talent subverting tropes convention case heroic portrait napoleonic cavalryman service creating complex challenging narrative perfect inspiration cuir cavalier richly spiced oud leather scent nods heavyweights smoky leather category carving smooth sophisticated niche cuir cavalier opens bright fiery crisp italian red tangerine paired luscious saffron leading rich floral leather heart warm powerful base oud vanilla hums beautifully perfect chord still potent thread saffron continues elevate entire composition poised masculine gracefulness like masterpiece presents iconic image way never seen cuir cavalier bold new portrait classic concept,"red tangerine, saffron, rose, iris, cypriol, white honey, oud, soft leather, cedar, tonka bean, vanilla, musk"
Chameleon Eau de Parfum,Zoologist,"Like the luminescent skin of a reptile, fiery scales of sunlight ripple across the surface of the Indian Ocean, fading slowly to gold and finally sapphire as the sun sinks and disappears. The sea exhales, its gentle tide caressing the beach of an island paradise. The salty breath combines with the narcotic aromas of the ylang and frangipani trees in an intimate kiss, sending shivers through the branches. Something stirs, an eye pivots, a tail grips a slender bough. Will the creature vanish among the leaves, or flirt with a daring display of colour? No one knows. The secrets that lie beneath the skin of the chameleon keep Madagascar guessing. What we do know, however, is that Zoologist Chameleon is a deliciously elusive blend of bright florals, hypnotic musks, and exotic fruit that can turn the wearer into anything they want to be. Madagascar, home to half of the world's species of chameleons, holds the key to Zoologist Chameleon. Like the kaleidoscope of hues that swirl within the flesh of these exotic creatures, ylang dances with delicate frangipani upon your skin in a melody of creamy florals, while aphrodisiac vanilla blends with salty, silky musks to envelop you in the fruity, exotic atmosphere of the island. Whether you desire to shroud yourself in an air of mystery, or blatantly flaunt your true colours, Chameleon becomes you.","bergamot, lemon, ylang-ylang, mango, pink pepper, star fruit, violet leaves, cashmeran, clove, coconut, frangipani, jasmine, saffron, salty skin accord, sea breeze, amber, woods, musk, opoponax, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like luminescent skin reptile fiery scales sunlight ripple across surface indian ocean fading slowly gold finally sapphire sun sinks disappears sea exhales gentle tide caressing beach island paradise salty breath combines narcotic aromas ylang frangipani trees intimate kiss sending shivers branches something stirs eye pivots tail grips slender bough creature vanish among leaves flirt daring display colour one knows secrets lie beneath skin chameleon keep madagascar guessing know however zoologist chameleon deliciously elusive blend bright florals hypnotic musks exotic fruit turn wearer anything want madagascar home half world's species chameleons holds key zoologist chameleon like kaleidoscope hues swirl within flesh exotic creatures ylang dances delicate frangipani upon skin melody creamy florals aphrodisiac vanilla blends salty silky musks envelop fruity exotic atmosphere island whether desire shroud air mystery blatantly flaunt true colours chameleon becomes,"bergamot, lemon, ylang-ylang, mango, pink pepper, star fruit, violet leaves, cashmeran, clove, coconut, frangipani, jasmine, saffron, salty skin accord, sea breeze, amber, woods, musk, opoponax, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, vetiver"
Dodo Eau de Parfum,Zoologist,"The sun sparkled across rippling waves, its morning dance upon the Indian Ocean rousing the dodos from their carefree slumber. Stumbling drunkenly from their nests, the birds waddled through the sea of luscious ferns that carpeted the forest floor, to feast on fat, ripe berries. For generations, the island paradise of Mauritius nurtured the dodos, its predator-free and bountiful shores lulling them into a state of such complacency that even their wings grew idle, and flight was lost â even to memory. Ultimately their evolution would betray them cruelly, but while it lasted, the dodos enjoyed an existence marked by ease and comfort. It's only appropriate, therefore, that Zoologist Dodo is as laid-back a fougere as you'll ever encounter- an ultra-fresh, green, delightfully whimsical blend of fruit, flower and moss that may just lull you into a sublime state of relaxation. Dodo opens with an invigorating burst of tart lime and juicy berries, inviting you to venture deep into a forest dense with vibrant ferns. Delicate fiddleheads unfurl to reveal tendrils of feathery musk, as rosy florals float up to embrace them. Dodo is a paradox. Like those extinct inhabitants of Mauritius, the scent is at once classic and iconic, yet eerily unknowable and endlessly fascinating. The ideal fougere for those with an eclectic sensibility, who crave a life of leisure and contentment.","fern, lime, lychee, raspberry, ambergris, fir balsam, geranium, rose, amber, feathery musk, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sun sparkled across rippling waves morning dance upon indian ocean rousing dodos carefree slumber stumbling drunkenly nests birds waddled sea luscious ferns carpeted forest floor feast fat ripe berries generations island paradise mauritius nurtured dodos predator free bountiful shores lulling state complacency even wings grew idle flight lost even memory ultimately evolution would betray cruelly lasted dodos enjoyed existence marked ease comfort appropriate therefore zoologist dodo laid back fougere ever encounter ultra fresh green delightfully whimsical blend fruit flower moss may lull sublime state relaxation dodo opens invigorating burst tart lime juicy berries inviting venture deep forest dense vibrant ferns delicate fiddleheads unfurl reveal tendrils feathery musk rosy florals float embrace dodo paradox like extinct inhabitants mauritius scent classic iconic yet eerily unknowable endlessly fascinating ideal fougere eclectic sensibility crave life leisure contentment,"fern, lime, lychee, raspberry, ambergris, fir balsam, geranium, rose, amber, feathery musk, oakmoss, patchouli, sandalwood"
Santal Blanc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"As with most perfumes in the Serge Lutens line, the name of the fragrance never gives you the full story. Santal Blanc means white sandalwood, but this is not light, airy sandalwood and its personality is far deeper than you might expect. Built on a beautiful contrast of softness and piquancy, the fragrance opens with bursts of tangy pink pepper and fresh cedar notes, while its evolution brings out a creamy white sandalwood and beautifully unexpected twists of bitter cinnamon and fenugreek. Orris root (you'll recognize it as the scent of violets) rose and jasmine are background players, happy to let the woods, spices and musk mingle. Perfectly at ease on a man or woman, Santal Blanc is enigmatic and memorable, possessing enough mystery to keep you on your toes and wondering where its next evolution will take you-- forever changing, forever mysterious, forever enchanting.","white sandalwood, fenugreek, pink pepper, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, orris root, musk, benzoin, copaiba balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perfumes serge lutens line name fragrance never gives full story santal blanc means white sandalwood light airy sandalwood personality far deeper might expect built beautiful contrast softness piquancy fragrance opens bursts tangy pink pepper fresh cedar notes evolution brings creamy white sandalwood beautifully unexpected twists bitter cinnamon fenugreek orris root recognize scent violets rose jasmine background players happy let woods spices musk mingle perfectly ease man woman santal blanc enigmatic memorable possessing enough mystery keep toes wondering next evolution take forever changing forever mysterious forever enchanting,"white sandalwood, fenugreek, pink pepper, cinnamon, rose, jasmine, orris root, musk, benzoin, copaiba balsam"
City Of Jasmine Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums,"Summer in Damascus, when the jasmine blooms from every corner of the city. Well-dressed men stop to beat the afternoon heat with cool fresh fruits, or perhaps an icy drink of lemonade near a courtyard fountain. This is the portrait of City Of Jasmine, a delightfully refreshing masculine scent that takes the beloved and renowned structure of the fruit-forward men's scent to a newly exotic destination.
The first notes of City Of Jasmine should be familiar to those on board with the fruity-masculine trend- a juicy, gently tart apple set against a musky leather for a wonderfully crisp and modern opening. But City Of Jasmine separates itself from the pack with a luscious floral heart, the complex, delicately indolic jasmine smoothed with a touch of rose for a seductive element of floral sophistication head and shoulders above the imitators. In the long-lasting base, a perfect touch of musk and vanilla provides contrast against the still-fresh leather note and adds the perfect final phase to an unforgettable, everyday-perfect scent.

From The Heart Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums,"Inspired by the lush beauty of the traditional Arab-Islamic courtyard house and the many fruits and flowers that flourished there in the days of Old Damascus, From The Heart is a thoroughly lovely and joyful scent. Like the traditional bitter orange trees that spread their distinctively fresh aroma through the courtyard, From The Heart opens bright and citrussy, with a lusciously sweet fruitiness from peach and ylang. At the core of the scent, a fully blooming flower garden exudes lush romanticism from the exquisite damask rose, as well as the full-bodied, sensual freshness of lily, all warmed by a subtle ambered base.

King Of Flowers Extrait de Parfum,Alghabra Parfums,"In the Old City of Damascus, the narrow streets and ancient alleyways carry a dizzying, magical array of scents: fresh flowers from the marketplace, mouthwatering treats emerging hot from bakery ovens, exotic spices from bubbling pots in local kitchens. Taken together, these are the smells of a timeless community, and their indelible memory is the essence of King Of Flowers, a richly evocative extrait from Alghabra. Opening fresh, green, and citrussy, the composition soon deepens as the titular white flowers, warm and sensual, blossom in the heart of the fragrance against a smooth, creamy vanilla. A sophisticated touch of ambered leather makes us pause to think of the many travelers that have ventured these ancient streets- perhaps they, too, stopped to marvel at the wondrous combination of aromas on the warm summer breeze. If so, King Of Flowers would surely transport them back just as it does for us.

Featuring an exquisite floral bouquet supplemented with the finest agarwood extract available on the market, Poem Of Damas seems to forego the traditional fragrance structure: the rich, dark, smooth oud explodes off the skin from the first spray, soon met with a lusciously rich Damascene rose, warm, romantic and completely captivating.

As we adjust to the light, we bask in the sheer beauty of gardenia, romantic and opulent, blended perfectly with sweet orange blossom and lush jasmine.

Patiala Extrait,Thameen,"Created by Cartier in 1928 for an Indian Maharaja, the Patiala Necklace is an impossibly opulent piece of jewelry at the center of an unsolved mystery. Containing 2,390 diamonds, the necklace disappeared in 1948, only to have bits and pieces reappear at various auctions over the years without explanation. To this day, the disappearance has never been explained. In this spirit of opulence and mystery, Thameen presents Patiala, a shimmering and sophisticated sweet floral too precious to misplace. Patiala opens with a head-spinning rush of energizing citrus and blinding aldehydes, sparkling with the intensity of its namesake's centerpiece 235 carat diamond. Yet it wears as comfortably as the necklace might around one who could afford it, with a rich, lush heart of orange flower and rose that anoints the bearer as royalty. A sweet, musky amber glows for countless hours, bathing us in serene reflected light. The original Patiala Necklace has sadly been lost to mystery, never to be experienced in its original glory again. But with this Patiala, we have a pretty good sense of just how it must have felt to experience such luxurious beauty.","citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,created cartier indian maharaja patiala necklace impossibly opulent piece jewelry center unsolved mystery containing diamonds necklace disappeared bits pieces reappear various auctions years without explanation day disappearance never explained spirit opulence mystery thameen presents patiala shimmering sophisticated sweet floral precious misplace patiala opens head spinning rush energizing citrus blinding aldehydes sparkling intensity namesake's centerpiece carat diamond yet wears comfortably necklace might around one could afford rich lush heart orange flower rose anoints bearer royalty sweet musky amber glows countless hours bathing us serene reflected light original patiala necklace sadly lost mystery never experienced original glory patiala pretty good sense must felt experience luxurious beauty,"citrus, aldehyde, orange flower, rose, moss, amber, musk"

Molecule 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Following on in the Escentric Molecules' tradition of focusing on one or more modern synthetics for the ""meat"" of a fragrance, Molecule 04 focuses entirely on Javanol, a powerful Givaudan sandalwood synthetic that replaces natural sandalwood oil. In the hands of anyone else other than Geza Schoen, this could have been a disaster â Javanol is so potent that even a touch too much is, well, too much. But this is a triumph. Schoen has deployed his natural deftness of touch to ensure that the rosy, creamy, and steamy, tropical facets of Javanol are brought forward, and all its heaviness is left behind. It feels light, almost fresh, with a green stripped bark note that brings in an element of the great outdoors. ""What I love about Javanol is its almost psychedelic freshness,"" says Geza Schoen. ""It smells as if liquid metal grapefruit peel were poured over a bed of velvety cream colored roses."" We agree, adding only that this is a fragrance whose subtle power and radiance can be best perceived in the sillage rather than directly on the skin, giving you your own personal invisible cloak of gorgeousness.",javanol,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30852.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,following escentric molecules' tradition focusing one modern synthetics meat fragrance molecule focuses entirely javanol powerful givaudan sandalwood synthetic replaces natural sandalwood oil hands anyone else geza schoen could disaster javanol potent even touch much well much triumph schoen deployed natural deftness touch ensure rosy creamy steamy tropical facets javanol brought forward heaviness left behind feels light almost fresh green stripped bark note brings element great outdoors love javanol almost psychedelic freshness says geza schoen smells liquid metal grapefruit peel poured bed velvety cream colored roses agree adding fragrance whose subtle power radiance best perceived sillage rather directly skin giving personal invisible cloak gorgeousness,javanol
Escentric 04 - Travel Spray Eau de Toilette,Escentric Molecules,"Escentric 04 is very Geza Schoen. If you're familiar with this perfumer's work from Escentric Molecule and Anat Fritz to biehl parfumkunstwerke, then you'll know we mean this as a compliment. Escentric 04 contains Schoen's signature of turning heavy materials like woods into gauzy, air bound creations with the thoughtful use of modern synthetics like Iso E Super and Ambroxan. Unlike other perfumers who use these materials simply to boost radiance or projection, Schoen uses them as the main building blocks for entire perfumes â and Escentric 04 is evidence, once again, that he is brilliant at it. For Escentric 04, Schoen has chosen to focus on synthetic sandalwood. Javanol is a powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood, as is Polysantol, which is sweeter and creamier. Use too much of either and the scent can become loud and vulgar. But here, Schoen has woven a fizzing pink combo of grapefruit, rose, and pink pepper into the sandalwood, resulting in a light, creamy shimmer of woods that never overpowers. Hedione and ambroxan add a fresh, salty 'whiteness' that illuminates the woods from within. Nothing overdosed or harsh, just a perfect balance between sparkling fruit, roses, salt, flowers, creamy woods, and the spanking freshness of wet laundry. The ultimate summer 'my skin but better' scent for both men and women.","pink grapefruit, bergamot, juniper berry, pink pepper, hedione, freesia, osmanthus, orris, rose, javanol, mastic, labdanum, iso e super, musk, ambroxan, castoreum, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/30853.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,escentric geza schoen familiar perfumer's work escentric molecule anat fritz biehl parfumkunstwerke know mean compliment escentric contains schoen's signature turning heavy materials like woods gauzy air bound creations thoughtful use modern synthetics like iso e super ambroxan unlike perfumers use materials simply boost radiance projection schoen uses main building blocks entire perfumes escentric evidence brilliant escentric schoen chosen focus synthetic sandalwood javanol powerfully radiant synthetic sandalwood polysantol sweeter creamier use much either scent become loud vulgar schoen woven fizzing pink combo grapefruit rose pink pepper sandalwood resulting light creamy shimmer woods never overpowers hedione ambroxan add fresh salty 'whiteness' illuminates woods within nothing overdosed harsh perfect balance sparkling fruit roses salt flowers creamy woods spanking freshness wet laundry ultimate summer 'my skin better' scent men women,"pink grapefruit, bergamot, juniper berry, pink pepper, hedione, freesia, osmanthus, orris, rose, javanol, mastic, labdanum, iso e super, musk, ambroxan, castoreum, vetiver"

Aura Perfume Oil,Essential Faith,"The cult classic success of the original Essential Faith was undeniable evidence that there's nothing sexier than individuality- after all, the barely-there blend of exquisitely soft, musky oils was less of a perfume in any traditional sense and more a supercharged enhancement of your natural essence, blending seamlessly with each wearer to smell distinctively different on anyone. With Aura, the intoxicating original Essential Faith formula returns with an appropriately subtle supplement, a perfectly portioned dollop of exquisite vanilla, which adds a warming, seductive twist to the sublime freshness of the original. Creamy, cozy, not overly sweet, this is vanilla that glows with ambered tones, drawing people in for an unforgettable closer sniff. A divinely delicious second skin, Aura may not be for those who like their fragrances loud- but for those who value being true to themselves above all, it's downright essential.","musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cult classic success original essential faith undeniable evidence there's nothing sexier individuality barely blend exquisitely soft musky oils less perfume traditional sense supercharged enhancement natural essence blending seamlessly wearer smell distinctively different anyone aura intoxicating original essential faith formula returns appropriately subtle supplement perfectly portioned dollop exquisite vanilla adds warming seductive twist sublime freshness original creamy cozy overly sweet vanilla glows ambered tones drawing people unforgettable closer sniff divinely delicious second skin aura may like fragrances loud value true downright essential,"musk, vanilla"

Vanilla Shot Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"The first of the Sepia Collection, a bold trio of Parfum Extraits from legendary perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, Vanilla Shot is an extraordinary scent. Inspired by a photograph of a breathtaking Land Art sculpture from Martin Hill- an arch made of dry reeds suspended weightlessly above New Zealand's Wanaka Lake- Duchaufour delivers an equally gravity-defying fragrance that contrasts the deep, indulgent richness of pure vanilla with intensely fresh elements for a luminously oriental experience. Our expectations for a vanilla scent are disposed of almost instantly, as Vanilla Shot opens with a stimulating jolt of electric spice- coriander and saffron, supplemented with an ultra-clean aldehyde sparkle. But as with Hill's photograph, balance is paramount, and before our fragrance gets carried into the clouds a rich heart of dried fruit, warm opoponax, and fresh rose tethers us again to the land, hinting of depth yet to come. Against this deeply sensual contrast, we encounter a rich base of complex, creamy vanilla and sweet, warm resins, soothing and seducing even while the fresh elements continue to reach skyward, achieving a wondrous, poetic geometry that lingers for hours. A new high water mark for Olfactive Studios, Vanilla Shot is a unique, compelling accomplishment a world away from your typical vanilla fragrance.","coriander, saffron, aldehydes, rose, dried fruits, opoponax, vanilla, caramel, myrrh, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61515.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first sepia collection bold trio parfum extraits legendary perfumer bertrand duchaufour vanilla shot extraordinary scent inspired photograph breathtaking land art sculpture martin hill arch made dry reeds suspended weightlessly new zealand's wanaka lake duchaufour delivers equally gravity defying fragrance contrasts deep indulgent richness pure vanilla intensely fresh elements luminously oriental experience expectations vanilla scent disposed almost instantly vanilla shot opens stimulating jolt electric spice coriander saffron supplemented ultra clean aldehyde sparkle hill's photograph balance paramount fragrance gets carried clouds rich heart dried fruit warm opoponax fresh rose tethers us land hinting depth yet come deeply sensual contrast encounter rich base complex creamy vanilla sweet warm resins soothing seducing even fresh elements continue reach skyward achieving wondrous poetic geometry lingers hours new high water mark olfactive studios vanilla shot unique compelling accomplishment world away typical vanilla fragrance,"coriander, saffron, aldehydes, rose, dried fruits, opoponax, vanilla, caramel, myrrh, benzoin"
Amber Kiso Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Spare, serene, and deceptively deep, Amber Kiso is an enchanting new vision of an amber fragrance through the prism of feudal Japan. It's amber stripped down to its essence- an abstraction of captured light- taking a decidedly eastern alternative to the traditional labdanum-and-vanilla representation of European-style amber scents. Instead, Amber Kiso is a vision of sunlight piercing the tranquility of an ancient forest, the brightness of fresh moss against the unique strength of cedar and hinoki. A tendril of temple incense, pure and contemplative, winds itself throughout the heart of the scent, while a clean, smooth leather represents the traditional bushi armor of a samurai. Elegant and spiritual, Amber Kiso is unlike any amber we've encountered before- and we're lost in its spell.","cedar, incense, cypress, maple, patchouli, iris, hinoki, leather, treemoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68681.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,spare serene deceptively deep amber kiso enchanting new vision amber fragrance prism feudal japan amber stripped essence abstraction captured light taking decidedly eastern alternative traditional labdanum vanilla representation european style amber scents instead amber kiso vision sunlight piercing tranquility ancient forest brightness fresh moss unique strength cedar hinoki tendril temple incense pure contemplative winds throughout heart scent clean smooth leather represents traditional bushi armor samurai elegant spiritual amber kiso unlike amber we've encountered we're lost spell,"cedar, incense, cypress, maple, patchouli, iris, hinoki, leather, treemoss"
Amber Teutonic Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"As the companion scent to the Japanese-inspired Amber Kisu, you'd be forgiven for thinking the oh-so-European-named Amber Teutonic would be constructed in the more traditional labdanum-and-vanilla style amber form. However, we're delighted to report that Teutonic, inspired by the breathtaking old-growth forests of Austria and Germany, turns out to be every bit as creative as its counterpart, envisioning an amber alive with aromatic freshness, bursting with notes of pine, templin (fir) cone, and bright, stout cedarwood. A distinctively bright accord of cardamom and green mandarin adds to the luminous glow, while a rich base of smooth musk and sweet, balsamic opoponax provide a soothingly familiar amber warmth.

Each Other Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Inspired by the wild and wonderful street art of THoO founder Andrea Casotti's native Milan, Each Other is a collaboration with famed Milanese graffiti writer KayOne that uses an electrifying contrast of bright and dark notes to represent the urban vitality of their shared hometown. The fragrance opens high in the clouds, with a blinding burst of citrus shining like a ray of light on the iconic outline of the Duomo di Milano. But there's much more to this vibrant, bustling metropolis than tourist attractions, and Each Other quickly takes to the living, breathing streets, the colorful graffiti represented in fiery spice and rich aromatics. As the sun sets and the stylish young Milanese come out to play, nightfall takes the intriguingly bitter contrast of calamus and wormwood, like a strong cocktail to start the evening. Finally, warm labdanum and luminous vetiver represent the city lit up, inviting and intimidating, alive in its contradictions.

1900 L'Heure de Proust Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois,"1900, the height of La Belle Epoque. Legendary author Marcel Proust and a cherished confidante retire to the bains sulfureux for a day of elaborate pampering- steam, massage, and a grand tea service to while away the private hours. The delicacies enjoyed in these intimate moments make up the magical scent of 1900 L'Heure de Proust. Our service begins with the exquisite fruits used to flavour the tea, tart, bright grapefruit and lusciously juicy blueberry, set against the smoky richness of pure black tea and the refined leather upholstering the private couch to where our subjects have retired.

Sweet Flowers Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Sweet and fresh, fresh and sweet... so often in perfume, we find one at the expense of the other, resigned to the idea that what makes our mouths water and what makes our hearts flutter are mutually exclusive. And then a wonderfully romantic confection like Sweet Flowers crosses our nose, and we fall in love all over again.

Bakhoor,Montale,"Born from the ancient traditions of nomadic tribes of the Middle East, a Bakhoor is a unique take on fragrant smoke- a wood chip soaked in a special recipe- different for each person- of scented oils and resins and slowly burned in a vessel known as a Mabkhara. The resulting scent- no two identical, but always rich, smoky, sweet, woodsy- is thought to purify, relax, and even treat traditional maladies. As a perfume, Bakhoor draws on the long history of this tradition, delivering a raw, exotic scent that feels equally contemplative and seductive, rich in resin, sandalwood, oud, and leather. For those who love smoky, sophisticated, sensual scents with a touch of the out-of-ordinary- don't miss Bakhoor.","oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354006.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,born ancient traditions nomadic tribes middle east bakhoor unique take fragrant smoke wood chip soaked special recipe different person scented oils resins slowly burned vessel known mabkhara resulting scent two identical always rich smoky sweet woodsy thought purify relax even treat traditional maladies perfume bakhoor draws long history tradition delivering raw exotic scent feels equally contemplative seductive rich resin sandalwood oud leather love smoky sophisticated sensual scents touch ordinary miss bakhoor,"oud, saffron, tanned leather, cedarwood, vetiver, sandalwood, grey amber, white musk, gaiac"
Leather Patchouli Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Let's get one thing clear- Leather Patchouli is not a gourmand scent. After all, it more than delivers on its titular promise, delivering a rich, robust oriental with deep tones of earthy patchouli and smooth, masculine leather. You'd be forgiven for not realizing it on first sniff, though, as Leather Patchouli combines all the complimentary notes you might expect- labdanum, oud, cedarwood- with a delectable blend of white musk, vanilla, and saffron, balancing the richness of the main ingredients with a smooth sweetness that accentuates the natural gourmand aspects of the patchouli without ever venturing into ""sugar syrup"" territory. The result is a dynamic scent, rugged enough to satisfy the most macho of tastes, but smooth enough to sport with the most elegant of evening wear.","leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,let's get one thing clear leather patchouli gourmand scent delivers titular promise delivering rich robust oriental deep tones earthy patchouli smooth masculine leather forgiven realizing first sniff though leather patchouli combines complimentary notes might expect labdanum oud cedarwood delectable blend white musk vanilla saffron balancing richness main ingredients smooth sweetness accentuates natural gourmand aspects patchouli without ever venturing sugar syrup territory result dynamic scent rugged enough satisfy macho tastes smooth enough sport elegant evening wear,"leather, labdanum, oud, patchouli, cedar, sandalwood, saffron, ambergris, white musk, vanilla"
Amber Musk Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Montale, admittedly, is not known for subtlety- their bold perfumes wear their powerful Middle Eastern influences proudly, and as a result have become beloved of those craving fragrances of beastly projection and sillage. But that doesn't mean the venerable Parisian house doesn't do subtle from time to time, and the latest example- the warm, mysterious, Amber Musk- may be their best skin scent yet. Like a gentle caress, sweet, warm notes of amber glide tenderly above the skin, contrasting notes of clean powder against a soft, seductively musky current of animalic sensuality. It lingers on the skin for hours, leaving a trail of warm carnality in its wake, drawing those around you in ever closer. A true secret weapon if ever there was one, Amber Musk isn't like your typically beastly Montale scent- and it's all the sexier for it.","sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/354008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,montale admittedly known subtlety bold perfumes wear powerful middle eastern influences proudly result become beloved craving fragrances beastly projection sillage mean venerable parisian house subtle time time latest example warm mysterious amber musk may best skin scent yet like gentle caress sweet warm notes amber glide tenderly skin contrasting notes clean powder soft seductively musky current animalic sensuality lingers skin hours leaving trail warm carnality wake drawing around ever closer true secret weapon ever one amber musk like typically beastly montale scent sexier,"sweet amber, powder, white musk, grey amber, cedar"
Mefisto Gentiluomo Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati,"Mefisto Gentiluomo is, as the name suggests, a gentleman's cologne, composed in the style of the eaux de cologne used in upscale barbershop joints in Italy circa 1888. Like its progenitor, Mefisto, Gentiluomo takes what seems to have become a dirty word in perfumery â clean â and makes it sexy again. Think the steamy aromas in a traditional Italian barbershop after a shave â triple-milled soap, plush white towels, $500 handmade leather loafers, and the sweet creaminess of sandalwood lotion massaged into warm skin. Yes, Gentiluomo wins the day by being gorgeously, luxuriously clean without leaning on cheap musks or powder.
Right off the bat, Mefisto Gentiluomo playfully updates its predecessor's model by brushing its bright, salty citrus notes with icy mint and a burst of bitter green leaves. It wows on the basis of just how natural and mouth-wateringly fresh it smells. Salty lavender lends a subtle ozonic feel âÂ not marine or aquatic per se, but rather a hillside of leathery herbs brushed by sea air. We're impressed with the bubble of sweetness that floats up here, a slightly candied citrus or lavender note that serves to balance out the sharper notes, giving it a polished, modern vibe. But if Mefisto Gentiluomo starts out in the maquis of a Mediterranean hillside, and lingers in the luxuriantly bright, clean atmosphere of a traditional barbershop, it ultimately comes to rest in the milieu of a Florentine artisan's workshop, where the scent of suede mingles companionably with the patina of centuries-old wood. The flowers contribute only a softness of texture, but the iris stands out, bathing the aromatics in its spectral glow. Handsome, refined, and full of Italian braggadocio, Mefisto Gentiluomo is a fresh barbershop fougere with a hidden creamy floral-citrus core that pulls it out of 1888 and right into 2018.","bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67414.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mefisto gentiluomo name suggests gentleman's cologne composed style eaux de cologne used upscale barbershop joints italy circa like progenitor mefisto gentiluomo takes seems become dirty word perfumery clean makes sexy think steamy aromas traditional italian barbershop shave triple milled soap plush white towels handmade leather loafers sweet creaminess sandalwood lotion massaged warm skin yes gentiluomo wins day gorgeously luxuriously clean without leaning cheap musks powder right bat mefisto gentiluomo playfully updates predecessor's model brushing bright salty citrus notes icy mint burst bitter green leaves wows basis natural mouth wateringly fresh smells salty lavender lends subtle ozonic feel marine aquatic per se rather hillside leathery herbs brushed sea air we're impressed bubble sweetness floats slightly candied citrus lavender note serves balance sharper notes giving polished modern vibe mefisto gentiluomo starts maquis mediterranean hillside lingers luxuriantly bright clean atmosphere traditional barbershop ultimately comes rest milieu florentine artisan's workshop scent suede mingles companionably patina centuries old wood flowers contribute softness texture iris stands bathing aromatics spectral glow handsome refined full italian braggadocio mefisto gentiluomo fresh barbershop fougere hidden creamy floral citrus core pulls right,"bergamot, lavender, lemon, grapefruit, iris, rose, violet, amber, cedar wood, musk"
Uden Overdose Parfum,Xerjoff,"Who says perfection can't be improved upon? Though the name Uden Overdose implies that this scent is simply a stronger version of the original Uden, this scent has a distinct personality of its own and deserves to be taken on its own terms. How does it differ, you ask? Well, while Uden Overdose retains the wonderfully aromatic brightness of the original â the essence of its 'fougere' character - it swaps out the gourmand creaminess of Uden's booze, vanilla, and lavender for the dry toastiness of spice, hay, and woody ambers. Both are utterly charming in their different ways. But if original Uden is a fougere you feel tempted to eat, Uden Overdose is a fougere you want to roll around in, like you would in piles of new mown hay. Uden Overdose opens similarly to Uden, burning comet bright with the aromatic sharpness of bergamot and lemon. But while original Uden turns creamy with vanilla, Uden Overdose steers immediately into a dry, spicy track, a blaze of ginger root giving the citrus a thrillingly hot and dirty underbite. Think a tannic Earl Grey tea liberally spiked with grated ginger. It smells masculine, clean, and above all, dry, with nary a hint of sugar or cream around the edges. Tobacco blossom plays a central role in Uden Overdose, its green hay-like tones giving the gingery citrus tea a rustic edge reminiscent of herbs and wildflowers baking under a hot sun. Woody ambers and musks are applied with judicious restraint in the base, thickening and sweetening the scent but never disturbing the smooth, aromatic flow of the scent's trajectory. This one's such a pleasure to wear. If you love fougeres (and the original Uden) but want a woodsy, spicy take that gives you plenty of options, then Uden Overdose is your man.","bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51151.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,says perfection can't improved upon though name uden overdose implies scent simply stronger version original uden scent distinct personality deserves taken terms differ ask well uden overdose retains wonderfully aromatic brightness original essence 'fougere' character swaps gourmand creaminess uden's booze vanilla lavender dry toastiness spice hay woody ambers utterly charming different ways original uden fougere feel tempted eat uden overdose fougere want roll around like would piles new mown hay uden overdose opens similarly uden burning comet bright aromatic sharpness bergamot lemon original uden turns creamy vanilla uden overdose steers immediately dry spicy track blaze ginger root giving citrus thrillingly hot dirty underbite think tannic earl grey tea liberally spiked grated ginger smells masculine clean dry nary hint sugar cream around edges tobacco blossom plays central role uden overdose green hay like tones giving gingery citrus tea rustic edge reminiscent herbs wildflowers baking hot sun woody ambers musks applied judicious restraint base thickening sweetening scent never disturbing smooth aromatic flow scent's trajectory one's pleasure wear love fougeres original uden want woodsy spicy take gives plenty options uden overdose man,"bergamot, lemon, ginger, tobacco blossom, amber, musk"
Colognise Extrait de Cologne,Nishane,"In Turkey, houseguests are often greeted with a splash of bright, fresh lemon cologne on the hands, a traditional gesture of hospitality that both disinfects and leaves a vibrant, if short-lived scent. With Colognise, Nishane, a house well-known for rich, long-lasting extraits, takes this beloved custom and modernizes it into a dynamic, sexy, wonderfully easy-to-wear ""extrait de cologne""- a concentration that captures all of the vibrance and exuberance of a traditional citrus cologne, in a much longer-lasting 18% concentration. On first spray, Colognise positively explodes with bright, fresh lemon and bergamot, a fitting tribute to the simple, beautiful lemon colognes of its inspiration- but even in the opening, a smooth, beautiful green tea note hints at the greater complexity that lies ahead. Soon, an rich, emerging floral heart of lily and jasmine adds dimensionality and lush, unisex character, even as the citrus continues to sparkle. A sweet, grassy vetiver and soft musk further enrich the depth and romanticism, feeling modern and classic all at once. Created in the spirit of hospitality, Colognise is so very effortless to wear that you'll have to decide whether to share it with everyone- or keep it all for yourself.","bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77451.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,turkey houseguests often greeted splash bright fresh lemon cologne hands traditional gesture hospitality disinfects leaves vibrant short lived scent colognise nishane house well known rich long lasting extraits takes beloved custom modernizes dynamic sexy wonderfully easy wear extrait de cologne concentration captures vibrance exuberance traditional citrus cologne much longer lasting concentration first spray colognise positively explodes bright fresh lemon bergamot fitting tribute simple beautiful lemon colognes inspiration even opening smooth beautiful green tea note hints greater complexity lies ahead soon rich emerging floral heart lily jasmine adds dimensionality lush unisex character even citrus continues sparkle sweet grassy vetiver soft musk enrich depth romanticism feeling modern classic created spirit hospitality colognise effortless wear decide whether share everyone keep,"bergamot, lemon, green tea, jasmine, grapefruit, muguet, vetiver, neroli, musk"

Oud for Greatness Eau de Parfum,Initio Parfums,"The concept of 'sacred geometry', the inspiration behind Oud For Greatness, is that recurring symbols and motifs- including the sacred scent of oud- are so powerful and holy that they are imbued with these hidden connections to the world at large, transcending the material plane to align those who smell it with the vibrations of the universe. In other words, experiencing the true scent of oud is a tonic for physical, emotional, and spiritual health. With Oud For Greatness, Initio taps into that hidden source of power, delivering a vibrant, sensual, richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued with oud from beginning to end. It's a highly concentrated blend of pure, natural agarwood oil and natural oud wood, a rich accord that melds the dark, spicy, sweet, and smoky characteristics of this precious substance into an impossibly complex elixir, both energetic and contemplative, narcotic and seductive. An additional burst of savory spice comes by way of a rich blend of saffron and nutmeg, while bright lavender pushes it towards the sexy and masculine- though make no mistake, this scent is devastatingly sexy on men and women alike. While it might seem inexact to say that a fragrance offers something for everyone, we don't know how else to describe Oud For Greatness- we suppose a perfume this in tune with the hidden patterns of the world ought to smell this downright incredible.","lavender, saffron, nutmeg, natural oud wood, natural agarwood oil, patchouli, muscs",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/802005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,concept 'sacred geometry' inspiration behind oud greatness recurring symbols motifs including sacred scent oud powerful holy imbued hidden connections world large transcending material plane align smell vibrations universe words experiencing true scent oud tonic physical emotional spiritual health oud greatness initio taps hidden source power delivering vibrant sensual richly spicy fragrance deeply imbued oud beginning end highly concentrated blend pure natural agarwood oil natural oud wood rich accord melds dark spicy sweet smoky characteristics precious substance impossibly complex elixir energetic contemplative narcotic seductive additional burst savory spice comes way rich blend saffron nutmeg bright lavender pushes towards sexy masculine though make mistake scent devastatingly sexy men women alike might seem inexact say fragrance offers something everyone know else describe oud greatness suppose perfume tune hidden patterns world ought smell downright incredible,"lavender, saffron, nutmeg, natural oud wood, natural agarwood oil, patchouli, muscs"

Hyde Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes,"A venomously enchanting potion to turn the meek into monsters, Hyde is an unforgettably dark and smoky leather spiked with bolts of green, spicy florals. A flash of bright citrus marks the start of the transformation, and is quickly overtaken with a sensually sinister smokiness that fills the senses and floods the imagination.

Red Square Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len,"Red is the color of passion, of warning, of danger. And what can we say? We hate to be all 'matchy-matchy', but Red Square sure lives up to its name! It scoops up some of the fieriest 'red' notes in perfumery, like red pepper, red musk, clove or cinnamon, and padauk wood, an African rosewood, and whips them up into a hot blaze, cooling them down again with ash and aromatics for a never-ending dance of hot and cold that holds the wearer's attention throughout. Key to Red Square's exciting aroma is nar (meaning 'fire' in Arabic), a rare red Boswellia sacra frankincense from Oman that has a fresh, spicy pine-like aroma pitched halfway between elemi and cinnamon bark. The opening is a column of white smoke billowing from a censer where elemi resin burns over eucalyptus branches, liquid tar, and cloves, its trail purified by an antiseptic ginger note. We love the minty, camphoraceous aspect of the incense, because it injects a leafy bitterness. Before we get too comfortable, however, Red Square plunges everything into a bath of hot pitch, like Eau Lente poured into the La Brea tar pits. This gutsy move is what transforms what could have been just a nice incense scent into something mesmerizingly different. The scent continues on in this spiced, musky tar-like track for a while before smoothing out into a peppery incense accord that reminds us of the aldehydic coldness of Avignon (Comme des Garcons) or LAVS (UNUM). We recommend Red Square to anyone who thinks that incense no longer holds any surprises. Although it riffs off the bone structure of some of the greats, Red Square takes us in some new and surprising directions.","padauk wood, red frankincense, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,red color passion warning danger say hate 'matchy matchy' red square sure lives name scoops fieriest 'red' notes perfumery like red pepper red musk clove cinnamon padauk wood african rosewood whips hot blaze cooling ash aromatics never ending dance hot cold holds wearer's attention throughout key red square's exciting aroma nar meaning 'fire' arabic rare red boswellia sacra frankincense oman fresh spicy pine like aroma pitched halfway elemi cinnamon bark opening column white smoke billowing censer elemi resin burns eucalyptus branches liquid tar cloves trail purified antiseptic ginger note love minty camphoraceous aspect incense injects leafy bitterness get comfortable however red square plunges everything bath hot pitch like eau lente poured la brea tar pits gutsy move transforms could nice incense scent something mesmerizingly different scent continues spiced musky tar like track smoothing peppery incense accord reminds us aldehydic coldness avignon comme des garcons lavs unum recommend red square anyone thinks incense longer holds surprises although riffs bone structure greats red square takes us new surprising directions,"padauk wood, red frankincense, musk"
Noir Encens Eau de Parfum,Mad et Len,"Noir Encens is based on the scent of Mad et Len's beautiful Noir Encens potpourri â little nuggets of resin and wood soaked with frankincense essential oils â as well as the smoky, balsamic incense of an earlier release, the 2010 No. XLIII Encens. The 2018 Noir Encens takes the austere frankincense oil of the original and thickens it up with powdery tonka bean, velvety amber, and the rich booziness of amaretto, thus replacing High Mass with the coziness of a fireside on a cold winter's night, book in hand and cat on lap. The almondy heft of the tonka bean is both bitter in the cherry-amaretto sense of bitter and sweet in the marzipan sense of sweet - so perfectly balanced that you're never quite sure whether you're smelling the poison or the cure. One thing is for sure, though: Noir Encens is far more sensual than any incense scent has a right to be. Smelling it triggers both the desire to hibernate and to bite into someone's neck, so be careful. If you're driven to distraction by the balsamic, smoky, nigh on edible sexiness of fragrances such as Feve Delicieuse by Dior Privee, Hypnotic Poison by Dior, or Le Baiser du Dragon by Cartier, then you can't afford to miss out on Mad et Len's 2018 Noir Encens.","amber, frankincense, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,noir encens based scent mad et len's beautiful noir encens potpourri little nuggets resin wood soaked frankincense essential oils well smoky balsamic incense earlier release xliii encens noir encens takes austere frankincense oil original thickens powdery tonka bean velvety amber rich booziness amaretto thus replacing high mass coziness fireside cold winter's night book hand cat lap almondy heft tonka bean bitter cherry amaretto sense bitter sweet marzipan sense sweet perfectly balanced never quite sure whether smelling poison cure one thing sure though noir encens far sensual incense scent right smelling triggers desire hibernate bite someone's neck careful driven distraction balsamic smoky nigh edible sexiness fragrances feve delicieuse dior privee hypnotic poison dior le baiser du dragon cartier can't afford miss mad et len's noir encens,"amber, frankincense, tonka bean"

And The World Is Yours Extrait de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"Few photographs capture the sumptuousness of celebrity more than the iconic photograph of Faye Dunaway by famed English photographer Terry O'Neill. The starlet sits poolside at the Beverly Hills Hotel at 6 a.m., hungover from winning an Oscar, sanguine in a pale silk robe, newspapers in a moat around her feet declaring her victor. And who better to pay homage to this most Hollywood morning-after, but Dominique Ropion, master of the doe-eyed and disheveled A Lab On Fire classics What We Do In Paris Is Secret and Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out Of Bed?
And the World Is Yours kicks off with a blast of neroli that floods the senses, rich and fresh with the thrilling energy of a papparazzo's flashbulb. With a dramatic sigh, the neroli gives way to a warm, creamy orange blossom, enhanced with a flattering kick of spice. Ropion's signature vanilla musk plays its part with a powdery puff of heliotrope â apropos for the Hollywood sensuality. And just like the shimmering sunsets of Los Angeles, it melts into a honeyed, musky, golden finish. Like Dunaway in the photograph, And the World Is Yours is stylish, sexy- and still basking in the afterglow of last night's adventures.","neroli, cumin, orange blossom absolute, rose, heliotrope, sandalwood, vanilla pod co2, tonka absolute, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,photographs capture sumptuousness celebrity iconic photograph faye dunaway famed english photographer terry o'neill starlet sits poolside beverly hills hotel hungover winning oscar sanguine pale silk robe newspapers moat around feet declaring victor better pay homage hollywood morning dominique ropion master doe eyed disheveled lab fire classics paris secret messy sexy rolled bed world kicks blast neroli floods senses rich fresh thrilling energy papparazzo's flashbulb dramatic sigh neroli gives way warm creamy orange blossom enhanced flattering kick spice ropion's signature vanilla musk plays part powdery puff heliotrope apropos hollywood sensuality like shimmering sunsets los angeles melts honeyed musky golden finish like dunaway photograph world stylish sexy still basking afterglow last night's adventures,"neroli, cumin, orange blossom absolute, rose, heliotrope, sandalwood, vanilla pod co2, tonka absolute, tolu balsam"
But Not Today Extrait de Parfum,UNUM,"UNUM's But Not Today is named for that chilling moment in Silence of the Lambs when Dr. Hannibal Lecter sniffs Clarice Starling and leers â You use Evian skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today'. But Not Today is UNUM's scented capsule of the tension of that moment, where the pearly innocence of L'Air du Temps' carnation and lily, as worn by the fresh-faced Clarice Starling, faces off against the depraved bloodlust of castoreum, blood, and metal knives slicing through air, as represented by Hannibal himself. But Not Today's bloodcurdling mix of sweet indoles with blood, dust, and metal makes for an unsettling but strangely beautiful wear. But Not Today would be a great choice for anyone who prefers smelling interesting to merely pretty. Past the animalic roar of the bloody leather at the start, the scent develops into a spicy-floral gourmand that combines the culinary herb-and-spice-rack of Italian perfumery with creamy white flowers, freshened with the peppery greenness of lily. The powdery carnation that emerges in the base gives the scent an alluring 'old school' vibe redolent of the spicy leather drydowns of Caron's Tabac Blonde and En Avion. But Not Today is therefore that rare bird - possessed of both an avant-garde and retro character, but dominated by neither. But Not Today smells unique and doesn't compare easily to other fragrances. However, if you love scents such as Eva Kant by O'Driu, Vierges et Toreros by Etat Libre d'Orange, and Noun by Bogue, cut with the retro spice powder of L'Air du Temps and Tabac Blond, then waste no time in getting your nose on But Not Today.","metal, lily, jasmine, leather, castoreum, carnation, animal notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,unum's today named chilling moment silence lambs dr hannibal lecter sniffs clarice starling leers use evian skin cream sometimes wear l'air du temps today' today unum's scented capsule tension moment pearly innocence l'air du temps' carnation lily worn fresh faced clarice starling faces depraved bloodlust castoreum blood metal knives slicing air represented hannibal today's bloodcurdling mix sweet indoles blood dust metal makes unsettling strangely beautiful wear today would great choice anyone prefers smelling interesting merely pretty past animalic roar bloody leather start scent develops spicy floral gourmand combines culinary herb spice rack italian perfumery creamy white flowers freshened peppery greenness lily powdery carnation emerges base gives scent alluring 'old school' vibe redolent spicy leather drydowns caron's tabac blonde en avion today therefore rare bird possessed avant garde retro character dominated neither today smells unique compare easily fragrances however love scents eva kant o'driu vierges et toreros etat libre d'orange noun bogue cut retro spice powder l'air du temps tabac blond waste time getting nose today,"metal, lily, jasmine, leather, castoreum, carnation, animal notes"
Violon Basse 16 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF,"Thunderously dark, imposingly deep, Violon Basse 16 is a virtuosic performance of bassy, rich, impossibly smoky leather. Drawing its name from a wood or metal organ register that adds rich, imposing effect to the notes played, the scent more than replicates this function, lending the wearer a supernaturally powerful smokiness given subtle nuance with striking incense tones and dark notes of wood and leather.

Unda Maris 8 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF,"Unda Maris (""wave of the sea"") is an organ stop that plays two pipes of differing registers together, the higher and lower notes producing a rolling sound evocative of the flowing ocean. An olfactive version of this effect is at the center of Unda Maris 8, which features a montage of bright, fresh, and authentically oceanic notes (though without an official notes list, we're left to guess) against a ""lower register"" of warm, resinous woodsy and incensey tones, creating a beautiful and ever-evolving series of harmonies. One moment, the fragrance is all salty air and citrus zest, the next, warmly textured, spiced florals and incense- but always defined by the negative space between the highs and lows. It's not so much a shapeshifter as a fragrance of consistent mass but infinitely variable dimensions, each moment a new permutation to enjoy. Flowing, fascinating, and deeply soothing, Unda Maris 8 is that rare gem that perfectly delivers on a high concept while remaining oh so wonderfully wearable.","incense, vanilla, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, white musk, marine notes, myrtle, nutmeg, geranium, artemisia, myrtle, cedar, jasmine, eucalyptus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,unda maris wave sea organ stop plays two pipes differing registers together higher lower notes producing rolling sound evocative flowing ocean olfactive version effect center unda maris features montage bright fresh authentically oceanic notes though without official notes list we're left guess lower register warm resinous woodsy incensey tones creating beautiful ever evolving series harmonies one moment fragrance salty air citrus zest next warmly textured spiced florals incense always defined negative space highs lows much shapeshifter fragrance consistent mass infinitely variable dimensions moment new permutation enjoy flowing fascinating deeply soothing unda maris rare gem perfectly delivers high concept remaining oh wonderfully wearable,"incense, vanilla, patchouli, tonka bean, benzoin, white musk, marine notes, myrtle, nutmeg, geranium, artemisia, myrtle, cedar, jasmine, eucalyptus"
L'Heure Exquise 2020 Extrait de Parfum,Bortnikoff,"Spring in Paris has almost become summer today. The shades of evening begin to descend. You sit in a cafe in the city center and look at the Seine. The sun goes down and the colors of the day mix with the purple sky. The familiar outlines of objects are faded by pastel tones, your eyes rest, and your feelings become stronger. The waiter brings you a cup of cocoa and a dessert. Dusky air cools your face and you feel the richness of scents brighter than ever before: the beverage, the food and a bouquet of flowers nearby. It is L'heure Exquise. The fragrance starts with a soft mix of Cardamom and Citruses. In a moment you get into a whirlpool of spicy notes of Cocoa, Clove and Myrrh. The heart of the fragrance beats with floral notes of exotic Champaca and Jasmine. Indonesian and Vietnamese Oud, Tolu Balsam and delicate White Amber are warming the beautiful base of the fragrance.

I Am Trash Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"Put aside the marketing for a minute - no, I Am Trash (or Les Fleurs du Dechet) does not smell like trash! Etat Libre d'Orange is a brand known for making high concept art, and this is no exception. In I Am Trash, the idea is to raise awareness about the continued usefulness of the things that normally get thrown away, and find a way to upcycle these items to create something beautiful in its own right. I Am Trash is a perfume made entirely from 'found objects' like the fruit peels and wood chips leftover from extraction by the perfume or food industry. This makes perfect sense. After all, some of the most exquisite materials in perfumery derive from waste. Ambergris, for example, is effluvia from a whale washed up on a beach. Oud is a tree's white cell response to a fungal infection. And so on and so forth. But fear not, for I Am Trash is as far from the ruder, dirtier aspects of nature's waste as you can imagine. It is a gentle fruity-floral that wraps a woodland bouquet of wild strawberries, apple, rose, and citrus rind up in a frothy musk and asks you to forgive it its dramatic back story. Nothing dark or rotting lurks in the corners. This is a purely bright, sunny concoction of fruits and flowers, with clean musks, radiant Iso E Super, and a dab of creamy sandalwood in the base pinning it all together. Etat Libre d'Orange could have named this I Am Joy and nobody would blink. But we love the name I Am Trash because it's a reminder to be more thoughtful about what we throw away, and testament to the fact that, sometimes, out of trash comes true beauty.","bitter orange, apple, lemongrass, tangerine, rose, iso e super, wild strawberry, cedar, sandalore, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47753.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,put aside marketing minute trash les fleurs du dechet smell like trash etat libre d'orange brand known making high concept art exception trash idea raise awareness continued usefulness things normally get thrown away find way upcycle items create something beautiful right trash perfume made entirely 'found objects' like fruit peels wood chips leftover extraction perfume food industry makes perfect sense exquisite materials perfumery derive waste ambergris example effluvia whale washed beach oud tree's white cell response fungal infection forth fear trash far ruder dirtier aspects nature's waste imagine gentle fruity floral wraps woodland bouquet wild strawberries apple rose citrus rind frothy musk asks forgive dramatic back story nothing dark rotting lurks corners purely bright sunny concoction fruits flowers clean musks radiant iso e super dab creamy sandalwood base pinning together etat libre d'orange could named joy nobody would blink love name trash reminder thoughtful throw away testament fact sometimes trash comes true beauty,"bitter orange, apple, lemongrass, tangerine, rose, iso e super, wild strawberry, cedar, sandalore, akigalawood"
Noble XXI Cypress Parfum,Clive Christian,"Clive Christian Cypress is a beautifully-made masculine that manages to capture the magic of a French Riviera night, where the spicy greenness of the breeze sweeping through tall cypress trees mingles with the effervescence of freshly-poured champagne. Think F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda boozing it up in a citrus grove in Nice, the tinkle of laughter and light jazz floating on the warm night air, and that's the mood board right there for the scent. The opening to Cypress is surprisingly spicy, thick with cloves, cinnamon, ginger root, and the anisic mintiness of fresh basil. But it's also immensely fresh and sour, a lively undercurrent of tart bergamot playing off the green bitterness of cypress. Fans of the balsamic soapiness of Jaipur Homme will recognize echoes in Cypress, but where the Boucheron burrows deep into an opoponax base, Cypress swerves into an elegant essay on the dry richness of woods. In the base, a handsome pairing of oakwood and cedarwood knits together a rich weave of smoke, toasted wood, and spice until you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. In the far reaches of the scent, rich amber swells up to thicken the woods, adding weight but not sweetness. If anyone is feeling short-changed by the dearth in good masculines these days, then point them in the direction of Clive Christian Cypress âÂ they won't be disappointed.","petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58023.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,clive christian cypress beautifully made masculine manages capture magic french riviera night spicy greenness breeze sweeping tall cypress trees mingles effervescence freshly poured champagne think f scott fitzgerald zelda boozing citrus grove nice tinkle laughter light jazz floating warm night air that's mood board right scent opening cypress surprisingly spicy thick cloves cinnamon ginger root anisic mintiness fresh basil also immensely fresh sour lively undercurrent tart bergamot playing green bitterness cypress fans balsamic soapiness jaipur homme recognize echoes cypress boucheron burrows deep opoponax base cypress swerves elegant essay dry richness woods base handsome pairing oakwood cedarwood knits together rich weave smoke toasted wood spice can't tell one ends begins far reaches scent rich amber swells thicken woods adding weight sweetness anyone feeling short changed dearth good masculines days point direction clive christian cypress disappointed,"petitgrain, bergamot, basil, cypress, clove, ginger, nutmeg, amber, oakwood, cedar"
Champ de Fleurs Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Anne Flipo revisits of one of her most influential perfumes: 1999's La Chasse Aux Papillons. An impossibly soft, transparent tuberose that spells out spring in capital letters. In Champ de Fleurs, Flipo keeps the airy white floral in place, but takes it in a new and interesting direction. First, she freshens the topnotes with bitter grapefruit and a juicy pear note, giving the floral heart an icy 'morning dew' feel. Second, perhaps more significantly, she bolsters the airy tuberose with a creamy, full-fat pairing of gardenia and jasmine, so that the contrast between the fresh eau de cologne-style notes in the opening and the buttery floral heart feels even more dramatic. Velvety, creamy, and hovering somewhere between suggestive and innocent, Champ de Fleurs lingers on the skin and in the air for hours. It melts into the muskiness of your own skin, forming an aura that will leave people wondering if you're perfumed or have just been luxuriating in a long, steamy bath with honey and milk soap. Like La Chasse Aux Papillons and Chanel Beige, Champ de Fleurs is suggestive of springtime meadows but in an abstract, impressionistic way âÂ you smell the gardenia, the tuberose, and the crisp green muguet not as a living, breathing flower per se, but as a gently creamy floral watercolor that swirls all the colors together. Unabashedly feminine, we see Champ de Fleurs as the perfect choice for those who prefer a discreetly luxurious symphony of spring flowers over the loud, fleshy sexiness of a tuberose or gardenia solo.","grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily of the valley, cedar, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,anne flipo revisits one influential perfumes 's la chasse aux papillons impossibly soft transparent tuberose spells spring capital letters champ de fleurs flipo keeps airy white floral place takes new interesting direction first freshens topnotes bitter grapefruit juicy pear note giving floral heart icy 'morning dew' feel second perhaps significantly bolsters airy tuberose creamy full fat pairing gardenia jasmine contrast fresh eau de cologne style notes opening buttery floral heart feels even dramatic velvety creamy hovering somewhere suggestive innocent champ de fleurs lingers skin air hours melts muskiness skin forming aura leave people wondering perfumed luxuriating long steamy bath honey milk soap like la chasse aux papillons chanel beige champ de fleurs suggestive springtime meadows abstract impressionistic way smell gardenia tuberose crisp green muguet living breathing flower per se gently creamy floral watercolor swirls colors together unabashedly feminine see champ de fleurs perfect choice prefer discreetly luxurious symphony spring flowers loud fleshy sexiness tuberose gardenia solo,"grapefruit, pear, jasmine, lily valley, cedar, musk, amber"

Love & Crime Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo,"In 1905, a lovestruck young woman named Mazie Coyle devised a scheme to break her fiancee out of prison that would later become legendary- a hacksaw baked into a wedding cake. It was an escapade that would win the hearts of a nation, culminating in her joyous acquittal on all charges. To celebrate love, ingenuity, and the pleasures of nonviolently thumbing one's nose at the system, Ex Idolo presents Love & Crime, a delightfully bright floral gourmand with sass and style to spare. The scent is deceptively simple, a bold, lusciously romantic blend of rich vanilla and white florals, smooth, creamy and mouthwatering. However, just like the famous cake itself, there's a world of secrets hidden beneath the frosting. A vibrant note of red mandarin shines in the opening, bestowing a fruity brightness to the richly sugared exterior. Once we cut the cake, we're treated to both indulgent butteriness and, though a surprisingly dark, if subtle, note of cocoa, a hint of the illicit surprise within. But make no mistake, as things never take too challenging a turn- like the Coyle escape itself, this is a tale meant to charm and delight, and Love & Crime accomplishes that goal as deftly as a perfectly timed prison break.","red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lovestruck young woman named mazie coyle devised scheme break fiancee prison would later become legendary hacksaw baked wedding cake escapade would win hearts nation culminating joyous acquittal charges celebrate love ingenuity pleasures nonviolently thumbing one's nose system ex idolo presents love crime delightfully bright floral gourmand sass style spare scent deceptively simple bold lusciously romantic blend rich vanilla white florals smooth creamy mouthwatering however like famous cake there's world secrets hidden beneath frosting vibrant note red mandarin shines opening bestowing fruity brightness richly sugared exterior cut cake we're treated indulgent butteriness though surprisingly dark subtle note cocoa hint illicit surprise within make mistake things never take challenging turn like coyle escape tale meant charm delight love crime accomplishes goal deftly perfectly timed prison break,"red mandarin, classic feminine florals, baking sugar, star anise, natural cocoa, vanilla sponge cake"
Dark Lord Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Dangerously sophisticated, Dark Lord is both a fragrance of impeccable manners and seductive wickedness. It's a scent for gentlemen and scoundrels alike, both bold and subtle, constructed around a rich, gorgeous extract of raw Haitian vetiver and an intriguing blend of fruit-inflected, bright Sichuan pepper and electric bourbon pepper, smoothed behind a refined facade of leather and rum. Each supporting note- spicy, sweet, boozy, smooth, and earthy- coaxes out a corresponding facet of the vetiver, resulting in a men's fragrance with impressive versatility- in an office, worn with a sensible suit, it exudes suave, dignified elegance, while simultaneously adding a dangerous allure to a night out on the town- exactly what Kilian Hennessy had in mind from the beginning. Sure, you're just a regular, mild-mannered guy- but with a dash of Dark Lord, you can be so much more.","bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425200.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dangerously sophisticated dark lord fragrance impeccable manners seductive wickedness scent gentlemen scoundrels alike bold subtle constructed around rich gorgeous extract raw haitian vetiver intriguing blend fruit inflected bright sichuan pepper electric bourbon pepper smoothed behind refined facade leather rum supporting note spicy sweet boozy smooth earthy coaxes corresponding facet vetiver resulting men's fragrance impressive versatility office worn sensible suit exudes suave dignified elegance simultaneously adding dangerous allure night town exactly kilian hennessy mind beginning sure regular mild mannered guy dash dark lord much,"bergamot, sichuan pepper, bourbon pepper, davana, rum, jasmine, vetiver, cypriol, cedar, patchouli"
Princesses de Malabar Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Legends tell of the mythical Princesses of the Malabar coast of western India, wise women who ruled their kingdom with wisdom and equanimity; in the 18th century, their tale became a shorthand for gracious, fair, female leadership. Now, in a time where that quality is disappointingly ephemeral, Lubin delivers a fragrance meant to inspire and enchant a new generation of empowered women. Bursting with fruity-floral energy that floats into a gorgeously weightless cloud of powdery musk, Princesses of Malabar is a bridge between past and present, a thoroughly modern and delightful feminine scent with an undeniable link to the glamorous perfumes of centuries past. Princesses of Malabar opens with the dynamic sparkle of aldehydes and citrus, a bathing light that cleanses palette and soul to make way for the rich but never-heavy fruity floral base- a juicy spritz of peach, the sumptuous lushness of magnolia, the sexy-sweet combination of jasmine and ylang. It's every bit as fun and youthful as the latest mass market blockbuster, only a thousand times more sophisticated. The contrast is only heightened in the vintage-inspired base, which deploys the powdery strength of iris atop a pillow-soft confection of amber, musk, and tonka, flirting with the mouthwatering appeal of a gourmand while never tipping into over-sugared dessert territory. It's a sublime formula, as fun as it is formal, as sweet as it is smooth, as fresh as it is fancy- a 21st century feminine scent for the young at heart and old souls alike. We could all use a bit of royal inspiration in these trying times, and Princesses de Malabar seems destined to become a new classic.","cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, jasmine, ylang-ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/312028.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,legends tell mythical princesses malabar coast western india wise women ruled kingdom wisdom equanimity th century tale became shorthand gracious fair female leadership time quality disappointingly ephemeral lubin delivers fragrance meant inspire enchant new generation empowered women bursting fruity floral energy floats gorgeously weightless cloud powdery musk princesses malabar bridge past present thoroughly modern delightful feminine scent undeniable link glamorous perfumes centuries past princesses malabar opens dynamic sparkle aldehydes citrus bathing light cleanses palette soul make way rich never heavy fruity floral base juicy spritz peach sumptuous lushness magnolia sexy sweet combination jasmine ylang every bit fun youthful latest mass market blockbuster thousand times sophisticated contrast heightened vintage inspired base deploys powdery strength iris atop pillow soft confection amber musk tonka flirting mouthwatering appeal gourmand never tipping sugared dessert territory sublime formula fun formal sweet smooth fresh fancy st century feminine scent young heart old souls alike could use bit royal inspiration trying times princesses de malabar seems destined become new classic,"cotton flower, bergamot, peach flesh, white magnolia, jasmine, ylang-ylang, white musk, iris powder, sandalwood, sweet amber, tonka bean"
Liquid Illusion Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"Liquid Illusion opens with such a lush, fruity almond note that we instantly picture Marie Antoinette wearing it, giggling with girlfriends as she nibbles on pastel-colored petit fours. It's over-the-top delicious. Heliotrope, the tiny purple flower that smells like cherries and marzipan, ramps up the nutty gourmandise of this opening, but also ushers in a tart floral freshness that breathes air into the rafters. But Liquid Illusion is not just a fluffy gourmand delight (although it's certainly that, too). After a while, you become aware of the scaffolding beneath, with its complex system of cantilevers designed to keep those almond topnotes aloft. In particular, iris absolute, its shy aroma strengthened and made incredibly diffusive by irone and iracine (iris root oil compounds), casts a berried, violety forcefield around the scent. Tuberose absolute shows up, but comes armed with a girlish bubblegum nuance rather than its usual full desk of indole and rubber. The mix of all these floral and fruit elements is irresistible because it teeters on the line between innocent and seductive, girlish and come-hither. Benzoin imparts a gritty, brown sugar texture to the base that will make you want to bite your arm, but the real stars are the creamy tonka bean and musks, back-up generators of real balsamic warmth. Liquid Illusion is just the thing for when things just feel really bleak; a floral that skips the usual arm's-length froideur of flowers and offers you delicious, seductive warmth instead.","heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40132.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,liquid illusion opens lush fruity almond note instantly picture marie antoinette wearing giggling girlfriends nibbles pastel colored petit fours top delicious heliotrope tiny purple flower smells like cherries marzipan ramps nutty gourmandise opening also ushers tart floral freshness breathes air rafters liquid illusion fluffy gourmand delight although certainly become aware scaffolding beneath complex system cantilevers designed keep almond topnotes aloft particular iris absolute shy aroma strengthened made incredibly diffusive irone iracine iris root oil compounds casts berried violety forcefield around scent tuberose absolute shows comes armed girlish bubblegum nuance rather usual full desk indole rubber mix floral fruit elements irresistible teeters line innocent seductive girlish come hither benzoin imparts gritty brown sugar texture base make want bite arm real stars creamy tonka bean musks back generators real balsamic warmth liquid illusion thing things feel really bleak floral skips usual arm's length froideur flowers offers delicious seductive warmth instead,"heliotropin, almond, iris absolute, irone, iracine, tuberose, tonka, benzoin, amber, musk"
Love Tuberose Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Are you on a diet? Well, sorry, because Love Tuberose is destined to weaken your resolve. Amouage's second installment in its 'Secret Garden' series is an outrageously gourmand take on one of nature's most hot-headed blooms: tuberose. Eschewing all the green, vegetal, rubbery, and indolic facets normally associated with tuberose, Love Tuberose instead plays up all the creamiest, sweetest, and most buttery aspects of this sensuous flower until we arrive at a result that's less flower, more tres leches cake. Picture this: layers upon layers of creamy white jasmine and tuberose petals soaked in condensed milk and pressed into a 10-layer white cake, bound together by an ethereal gardenia buttercream. Honestly, if you put this on and don't allow an involuntary groan of pleasure to escape your lips, then you're stronger than we are. The Chantilly cream note is delicious, its whipped creaminess blurring the indolic thrust of tuberose so that the flower becomes feather-soft and almost innocent. Love Tuberose turns the heat back on, though, with a salty, musky drydown that wears like a halo of salty gardenia, sun-kissed skin, and sandalwood. An unabashedly feminine scent, Love Tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle is a perfect mirror of the frothy layers of tulle contained within. But would we deny a man a slice of white cake with buttercream frosting if he wanted it? No - this level of deliciousness deserves to be experienced by everyone.","tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41894.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,diet well sorry love tuberose destined weaken resolve amouage's second installment 'secret garden' series outrageously gourmand take one nature's hot headed blooms tuberose eschewing green vegetal rubbery indolic facets normally associated tuberose love tuberose instead plays creamiest sweetest buttery aspects sensuous flower arrive result that's less flower tres leches cake picture layers upon layers creamy white jasmine tuberose petals soaked condensed milk pressed layer white cake bound together ethereal gardenia buttercream honestly put allow involuntary groan pleasure escape lips stronger chantilly cream note delicious whipped creaminess blurring indolic thrust tuberose flower becomes feather soft almost innocent love tuberose turns heat back though salty musky drydown wears like halo salty gardenia sun kissed skin sandalwood unabashedly feminine scent love tuberose's pearlescent ivory bottle perfect mirror frothy layers tulle contained within would deny man slice white cake buttercream frosting wanted level deliciousness deserves experienced everyone,"tuberose, jasmine, gardenia, whipped cream, vanilla, sandalwood, cedar"
Tonka 25 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"Le Labo's first release in three years, we think Tonka 25 was worth the wait. An addictively dark and warm fragrance, Tonka 25 captures the humid funk of a forest's undergrowth, teeming with the buzz of insects, seeds, and resin. True to form for any Le Labo fragrance, tonka is a part of the composition but not the whole story. The crushed almond heft of tonka bean absolute is detectable in the background, where it infuses the perfume with aromatic woodsmoke, but for us, the real star of the show is the cedar, followed by musk and orange flower.
The Atlas cedar in Tonka 25 is spicy, humid, and almost dank, creating an impression of woodrot that's enhanced by a swirl of vegetal musks. For a moment, we're reminded of the animalic topnote of Oud 27, but this is less alien, far more human: warm, enveloping, and very sexy. The furred darkness of the woods and musk at the heart of Tonka 25 holds sway for much of the scent's life, but we'd be remiss in not mentioning the extraordinary orange flower absolute. Orange blossom's gift to Tonka 25 is a green, waxy brightness that feels like a honey candle glowing through a knot of hemp. Finally, enter styrax resin, blessing the drydown with a leathery, smoky richness. If you're looking for something that will comfort and titillate in equal measure, then put Le Labo Tonka 25 on top of your test list. Dark woods expanded by creamy animalic musks, crushed tonka, and smoky resin, backlit by silky orange flower....a glowering Heathcliff in a bottle.

It's with this in mind that Floris has given us A Rose For, an utterly unique oriental rose scent built upon a sweeping, sumptuous bouquet of warm, deep Moroccan rose absolute and lush, rich Bulgarian rose oil. Balancing both the exquisite delicacy and intense power of the rose, A Rose For opens with an exotically fresh blend of tea, incense and cassis before making way for the complexity of the floral blend. A melange of spices and woodsy notes unfolds differently on everyone, coaxing out an unpredictably beautiful blend of smooth and vibrant that surprises even as it delights.

Ruby Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora,"80 years ago, Nestle launched the first bar of white chocolate, bringing the number of naturally-colored chocolate in the world to 3: dark, milk, and white. But in 2017, after 13 straight years of research and development, Barry Callebaut, one of the world's most respected artisanal chocolate makers, decided that the world was ready for a fourth color â pink! Derived from a special cocoa bean, Ruby is a 100% naturally pink chocolate that possesses a uniquely sour, berry-like fruitiness not present in other types of chocolate. It was a breakthrough for the confectionary business worldwide â and for perfumery too. Bruno Acampora's Ruby is the world's first fragrance based on the scent and taste of this extraordinary pink chocolate. Please take our word for it â it's luscious. Ruby opens with sour cherries enrobed in melted dark chocolate, a hint of booze, rose, and coffee playing around the edges like a smile. Cleverly emulating the fruitiness of Ruby chocolate, the creaminess of the cocoa notes is imbued with a streak of either redcurrant or blackberry, so you get both the milky sweetness and the tongue-tickling sourness that makes pink chocolate so unique. But before you're tempted to stick your entire arm in your mouth (it's that delicious), the perfume finishes in a blaze of that earthy, semi-funky 1970's style musk for which the Acampora brand is famous. If smelling like dark chocolate, berries, and a bodaciously sexy musk is your thing (and why wouldn't it be?), then get your nose on Ruby as soon as you humanly can.","dark chocolate, rose, red berries, pink pepper, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37539.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,years ago nestle launched first bar white chocolate bringing number naturally colored chocolate world dark milk white straight years research development barry callebaut one world's respected artisanal chocolate makers decided world ready fourth color pink derived special cocoa bean ruby naturally pink chocolate possesses uniquely sour berry like fruitiness present types chocolate breakthrough confectionary business worldwide perfumery bruno acampora's ruby world's first fragrance based scent taste extraordinary pink chocolate please take word luscious ruby opens sour cherries enrobed melted dark chocolate hint booze rose coffee playing around edges like smile cleverly emulating fruitiness ruby chocolate creaminess cocoa notes imbued streak either redcurrant blackberry get milky sweetness tongue tickling sourness makes pink chocolate unique tempted stick entire arm mouth delicious perfume finishes blaze earthy semi funky 's style musk acampora brand famous smelling like dark chocolate berries bodaciously sexy musk thing get nose ruby soon humanly,"dark chocolate, rose, red berries, pink pepper, musk"

Percival Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"Named for a mythical French thoroughbred, Percival is that rarest of wonders- a truly ageless masculine. Sure, we can picture a dashing racing horse thundering around an 18th century track to the delight of the aristocracy, but Percival is every bit as appropriate on a debonair gentleman in a pristine late-model luxury sedan, stylishly cutting his way through the bustling city night on his way to an exclusive gathering. With a subtle yet striking balance between citrus and aromatic notes, a richly masculine floral heart of lavender, violet and geranium, and a spiced, deeply woodsy base, this is the kind of scent that wears as perfectly on any man as an impeccably tailored three-piece suit- a timeless signifier of dignity and taste. Fresh, sensual and refined, Percival is bound to leave a lasting impression.","bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70027.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,named mythical french thoroughbred percival rarest wonders truly ageless masculine sure picture dashing racing horse thundering around th century track delight aristocracy percival every bit appropriate debonair gentleman pristine late model luxury sedan stylishly cutting way bustling city night way exclusive gathering subtle yet striking balance citrus aromatic notes richly masculine floral heart lavender violet geranium spiced deeply woodsy base kind scent wears perfectly man impeccably tailored three piece suit timeless signifier dignity taste fresh sensual refined percival bound leave lasting impression,"bergamot, mandarin, aromatic notes, jasmine, violet, geranium, lavender, pink pepper, coriander, cinnamon, musk, woody notes, spices, pepper, nutmeg, tonka"
Vetiverissimo Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"Vetiverissimo is Bruno Fazzolari (now creating scents under the FZOTIC label) at his most stripped-back and personal; it's the vetiver he made for himself. Calming and Zen-like, this is the vetiver you wear to relax and clear your mind. No topnotes to speak of, and no back-story either â just a superb quality vetiver dusted with a hint of warming spice, bleeding gradually into a protracted woody drydown. Wearing Vetiverissimo feels like doing a factory re-set on your nerves. With its matte, earthen dustiness and subtle spice, it smells less like a Western perfume and more like Mitti Attar, a traditional Indian distillation of clay into sandalwood oil that captures the scent of rain on red soil. A flicker of turmeric or saffron gives the earthy vetiver a little kick, but doesn't interrupt the smooth Zen flow of the scent. On paper, the rooty greenness of the vetiver seems to last forever, but on skin, it slides quickly and seamlessly into the warm embrace of polished woods, a balanced tandem of aromatic sandalwood and spicy, resinous cedar. Drying down into a smoky powder hovering between sandalwood paste and zukoh (incense powder), Vetiverissimo is a laid-back ayurvedic salve for frazzled tempers and city stress. In fact, it's so good we think it should be prescribed by doctors.","spice, vetiver, cedar, resins, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69314.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,vetiverissimo bruno fazzolari creating scents fzotic label stripped back personal vetiver made calming zen like vetiver wear relax clear mind topnotes speak back story either superb quality vetiver dusted hint warming spice bleeding gradually protracted woody drydown wearing vetiverissimo feels like factory set nerves matte earthen dustiness subtle spice smells less like western perfume like mitti attar traditional indian distillation clay sandalwood oil captures scent rain red soil flicker turmeric saffron gives earthy vetiver little kick interrupt smooth zen flow scent paper rooty greenness vetiver seems last forever skin slides quickly seamlessly warm embrace polished woods balanced tandem aromatic sandalwood spicy resinous cedar drying smoky powder hovering sandalwood paste zukoh incense powder vetiverissimo laid back ayurvedic salve frazzled tempers city stress fact good think prescribed doctors,"spice, vetiver, cedar, resins, woods"
Lucid Dream Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo,"Lucid Dream is an olfactory exploration of the semi meditative state in which a person is aware they are asleep but is able to control their surroundings, and an ode to the potential hidden in every one of us. Juxtaposing rich, bright notes of pink pepper and davana with smoky, meditative florals and incense, Lucid Dream truly feels like another plane of existence, an ethereal journey into a world where we follow our wildest artistic impulses and break through the creative blocks that may impede our waking lives. It's a vivid, yet ethereal, experience, simultaneously romantic and contemplative, with the outstanding ingredient quality and rich tonalities for which Ex Idolo is known. Will Lucid Dream make you a master of your own subconscious? While we can't guarantee it, with a scent this wonderfully evocative, you'll certainly be inspired to find out.","pink pepper, davana, smoky osmanthus, rose, incense, white patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lucid dream olfactory exploration semi meditative state person aware asleep able control surroundings ode potential hidden every one us juxtaposing rich bright notes pink pepper davana smoky meditative florals incense lucid dream truly feels like another plane existence ethereal journey world follow wildest artistic impulses break creative blocks may impede waking lives vivid yet ethereal experience simultaneously romantic contemplative outstanding ingredient quality rich tonalities ex idolo known lucid dream make master subconscious can't guarantee scent wonderfully evocative certainly inspired find,"pink pepper, davana, smoky osmanthus, rose, incense, white patchouli"
Flash Back In New York Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"What an interesting and original flanker! Like the fuzzy picture of a snowy New York avenue taken as its starting point, Flash Back in New York weaves rhubarb, apple, leather, and wood together so seamlessly that it's difficult to pick out the individual lines at first. But slowly, like the shape of a building or a person emerging from a blur of snowflakes, we are able to make out the earthiness of vetiver, its grey-brown smokiness illuminated in spots by the brightness of unripe fruit. If the scent begins in earth and fruit, it soon develops in a series of surprising directions that keep our interest engaged. One strand leads us off into a gently spicy tonka bean diversion, another into a smoky violet-and-saffron leather, and yet another into an aromatic woody finish. We especially love the contrast between the soft warmth of the cumin and tonka pushing against the milky coolness of the leather and papyrus. Just as in the original photo by Vivienne Gucwa, Flash Back in New York is all about the hard angles of light slicing through a fuzzy darkness. If you love either Santal 33 by Le Labo or Terre d'Hermes by Hermes but wish for a gentler, more diffuse take that's stunning on either a man or a woman, then try Flash Back in New York. Its woodsy, androgynous sexiness will appeal even to those who don't normally wear fragrance.","cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,interesting original flanker like fuzzy picture snowy new york avenue taken starting point flash back new york weaves rhubarb apple leather wood together seamlessly difficult pick individual lines first slowly like shape building person emerging blur snowflakes able make earthiness vetiver grey brown smokiness illuminated spots brightness unripe fruit scent begins earth fruit soon develops series surprising directions keep interest engaged one strand leads us gently spicy tonka bean diversion another smoky violet saffron leather yet another aromatic woody finish especially love contrast soft warmth cumin tonka pushing milky coolness leather papyrus original photo vivienne gucwa flash back new york hard angles light slicing fuzzy darkness love either santal le labo terre d'hermes hermes wish gentler diffuse take that's stunning either man woman try flash back new york woodsy androgynous sexiness appeal even normally wear fragrance,"cumin, clary sage, white linen, saffron, violet, leather, jasmine, birch, papyrus, vetiver, tonka bean"
Woody Mood Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"With Woody Mood, perfumer Betrand Duchaufour reaches inside our head and pulls out all our fantasies of fall â crisp air, sweet woodsmoke, the crackle of leaves hitting the bonfire â compiling them into an autumnal essay that satisfies down to the bone. The inspiration for Woody Mood is Roger Steffens's 1973 photo of a woman wandering alone in a California redwood forest, shafts of sunlight piercing the gloom. Since Duchaufour is the father of perfume history's most influential woody-incense scents (Timbuktu, Avignon, etc.), it makes perfect sense that he was the perfumer chosen to translate the photo into fragrance form. Woody Mood opens with a buzz of whiskey-soaked wood, rich and wet, which quickly dries out into a ribbon of pure woodsmoke winding lazily through chill air. Aromatic sage and spikenard give the woods a masculine swagger, but we see this scent working beautifully on a woman's skin too. From the radiant blaze of woods emerges a core of rubbery black tea, cacao, and styrax, darkening the scent to the point where we're no longer sure whether we're smelling wood or leather. The contrast in Woody Mood between the peppery brightness of the woods and the darkness of burnt resin is a perfect mirror of the play of light on dark in the photo. Like Au Coeur du Desert, Woody Mood's genius lies in conjuring up a vivid chiaroscuro from a restricted palette of earth tones. If you love the radiant smokiness of woodsmoke without the additional weight of amber or cream, then this scent by Olfactive Studio is a no-brainer.","bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,woody mood perfumer betrand duchaufour reaches inside head pulls fantasies fall crisp air sweet woodsmoke crackle leaves hitting bonfire compiling autumnal essay satisfies bone inspiration woody mood roger steffens's photo woman wandering alone california redwood forest shafts sunlight piercing gloom since duchaufour father perfume history's influential woody incense scents timbuktu avignon etc makes perfect sense perfumer chosen translate photo fragrance form woody mood opens buzz whiskey soaked wood rich wet quickly dries ribbon pure woodsmoke winding lazily chill air aromatic sage spikenard give woods masculine swagger see scent working beautifully woman's skin radiant blaze woods emerges core rubbery black tea cacao styrax darkening scent point we're longer sure whether we're smelling wood leather contrast woody mood peppery brightness woods darkness burnt resin perfect mirror play light dark photo like au coeur du desert woody mood's genius lies conjuring vivid chiaroscuro restricted palette earth tones love radiant smokiness woodsmoke without additional weight amber cream scent olfactive studio brainer,"bergamot, ginger, clary sage, saffron, sequoia, spikenard (jatamansi), black tea, incense, patchouli, leather, styrax, cacao"
Kings Wood Fragrance Concentree,Shay & Blue,"Not in the least bit like Aventus! Just putting that out there (we're aware that pineapple is a trigger word for some). No, Kings Wood takes the oft-abused pineapple and sets it among aromatic herbs and greenery for a gentlemanly English garden fougere that's mercifully low on sugar. It's clean, aromatic, and above all, unpretentious. We love it. Although the topnote is clearly pineapple, it has a thrilling tartness that leans more on grapefruit and tart greenery than tropical cocktail. Its fougere bone structure really comes into focus once that big, handsome oak note settles in, shoring up all the peppery herbs and fruit with its broad shoulders.

Cuir Celeste Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"Does artistic talent transcend its medium? That's the question posed by Ex Nihilo's bold new Visionnaire series, which explores the answer by pairing renowned visual artists with Ex Nihilo perfumers to help them shape their artistic conceptions into actual scents. For the premiere of the series, they've teamed Ex Nihilo house perfumer Quentin Bisch with acclaimed photographer Mathieu Cesar, and the result is Cuir Celeste, an arrestingly modern, surprisingly nuanced leather scent with all the vibrant contrast of a museum-quality B&W print. Cuir Celeste opens with a clean, dry violet leaf accentuated with the quiet energy of a restrained black pepper note. The leather accord here strikes a compelling balance between gentle ambrette-laced florals and bitter galbanum, with cypriol providing a rich, dry, papyrus-like base anchored to the spicy and woodsy tones of akigalawood. The effect is modern, smooth, and intriguing- a scent that doesn't so much mimic the actual aromas of photography so much as it smells the way a photograph looks- a representation of reality through the lens of a creator. If you love modern floral leather, don't miss Cuir Celeste- it's a work of art.","black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72053.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,artistic talent transcend medium that's question posed ex nihilo's bold new visionnaire series explores answer pairing renowned visual artists ex nihilo perfumers help shape artistic conceptions actual scents premiere series they've teamed ex nihilo house perfumer quentin bisch acclaimed photographer mathieu cesar result cuir celeste arrestingly modern surprisingly nuanced leather scent vibrant contrast museum quality b w print cuir celeste opens clean dry violet leaf accentuated quiet energy restrained black pepper note leather accord strikes compelling balance gentle ambrette laced florals bitter galbanum cypriol providing rich dry papyrus like base anchored spicy woodsy tones akigalawood effect modern smooth intriguing scent much mimic actual aromas photography much smells way photograph looks representation reality lens creator love modern floral leather miss cuir celeste work art,"black pepper, violet leaf, galbanum, ambrette, osmanthus, patchouli, cypriol, akigalawood"
EO No. 1 EdP Eau de Parfum,Ensar Oud,"When Ensar released Sultan Leather Attar to overwhelming acclaim, he realized something- that even outside of his extraordinary pure oudh and sandalwood oils, fragrance connoisseurs were starving for rich, evocative blends that defy conventional trends. But to make an Eau de Parfum utilizing his unprecedented collection of exquisite natural materials, avoiding cheap, easy to use synthetics, was a major risk. Still, the people were calling out for an EDP. And now, here we are. And what does an all-natural Ensar Oud EDP smell like? We're sure you can imagine it involves oud and leather, and boy does it- a blend containing such jaw-dropping materials as bright, clean, powerful $2,500/3gr Kyaratul Mustafa oud oil, 13-year-aged wild Hainan sinensis extract, and precious, carefully aged rose oil from Sultan Qaboos's private collection. The results are wonderfully rich, the oud and leather sing of power and sophistication, the rose a perfectly lush counterpart adding romantic depth. There's no barnyard funk to be found here, just the type of elegantly masculine warmth that a lady of style could also wear with aplomb. A luxurious flacon adorned with real, naturally tanned, pure full-grain Italian leather completes the vision.

Tyrannosaurus Rex Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"A sultry heat wafts across the land, lapped up greedily by the abundant flora that thrives in its midst. Trees soar to majestic heights and plants flower for the first time, their petals spreading to give birth to a world rich in diversity. The Cretaceous period comes of age against a backdrop scorched by wildfire and lightning strikes. Over this turbulent landscape, a massive predator looms. Giants rule the earth, but even giants can be cut down within the powerful jaws of the fearsome tyrannosaur. Standing tall, the terrifying beast fears nothing, until that pivotal moment when a fire in the sky signals the end of their deadly reign.
Zoologist Tyrannosaurus Rex is a gargantuan scent that sinks its teeth into the world of delicate fragrances and rips it wide open. Primitive woods and florals seize you and snatch you away to an ancient era. Smoky, charred wood warns of the danger of smouldering fire, setting your senses on edge, while droplets of metallic rose oxide offer a chilling premonition of blood-lust. The mighty Tyrannosaurus Rex is sometimes menacing, sometimes fascinating, but never, ever ordinary.","bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang-ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76022.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sultry heat wafts across land lapped greedily abundant flora thrives midst trees soar majestic heights plants flower first time petals spreading give birth world rich diversity cretaceous period comes age backdrop scorched wildfire lightning strikes turbulent landscape massive predator looms giants rule earth even giants cut within powerful jaws fearsome tyrannosaur standing tall terrifying beast fears nothing pivotal moment fire sky signals end deadly reign zoologist tyrannosaurus rex gargantuan scent sinks teeth world delicate fragrances rips wide open primitive woods florals seize snatch away ancient era smoky charred wood warns danger smouldering fire setting senses edge droplets metallic rose oxide offer chilling premonition blood lust mighty tyrannosaurus rex sometimes menacing sometimes fascinating never ever ordinary,"bergamot, black pepper, fir, laurel leaf, neroli, nutmeg, champaca, geranium, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang-ylang, resins, cade, cedar, civet, frankincense, leather, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla"
Remember Me Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"Remember Me is an olfactory aide-memoire of an inspiring trip to Qatar that perfumer Cecile Zarokian took with Jovoy founder, Francois Henin. While in Doha, Cecile fell in love with the scent of Karak, a local chai made with lots of lush, sweet milk, cardamom, and ginger, the steam of which mingled companionably with the exotic mukhallats and bakhoor she was sampling. Combined with wafts of frangipani coming from the shady avenues of Doha, Remember Me is a memory capsule of these exotic but comforting scents. Combining edible elements like milk, vanilla, and chai with less edible notes such as leather and wood, Remember Me is a modern, sophisticated gourmand - it avoids making you think directly of food. Everything here is remarkably well balanced. The chai is peppery hot with ginger, but calmed by a generous pour of steamy milk and vanilla. In turn, the creaminess of the tea is kept fresh by a duo of bergamot and cardamom threaded through the scent like a tart green ribbon. You'd be forgiven for looking at the notes for this â vanilla, frangipani, milk and so on â and assuming that it's a purely feminine affair. But no, it's 100% unisex! Unusually, what pulls Remember Me firmly into the center is the frangipani; the variety used here smells more like peachy suede than tropical flowers. Remember Me is a milky chai suede that comfortably occupies the meeting place between gourmand, oriental, and leather. If you love unusual, complex 'sweet' fragrances such as El Born by Carner Barcelona and Leder 6 by J.F. Schwarzlose, then Remember Me might be your new obsession.","bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61615.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,remember olfactory aide memoire inspiring trip qatar perfumer cecile zarokian took jovoy founder francois henin doha cecile fell love scent karak local chai made lots lush sweet milk cardamom ginger steam mingled companionably exotic mukhallats bakhoor sampling combined wafts frangipani coming shady avenues doha remember memory capsule exotic comforting scents combining edible elements like milk vanilla chai less edible notes leather wood remember modern sophisticated gourmand avoids making think directly food everything remarkably well balanced chai peppery hot ginger calmed generous pour steamy milk vanilla turn creaminess tea kept fresh duo bergamot cardamom threaded scent like tart green ribbon forgiven looking notes vanilla frangipani milk assuming purely feminine affair unisex unusually pulls remember firmly center frangipani variety used smells like peachy suede tropical flowers remember milky chai suede comfortably occupies meeting place gourmand oriental leather love unusual complex 'sweet' fragrances el born carner barcelona leder j f schwarzlose remember might new obsession,"bergamot, lemon, cardamom, tea, frangipani, ginger, milk, woody notes, cedar, vanilla"
Le Participe Passe Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Do you love balsamic, resinous fragrances? Are you addicted to the radiant warmth, the languorous sweetness, the oriental spice? Serge Lutens certainly does, with deep, stylish accords of resin and balsam present in the background of many of his most classic scents. With Le Participe Passe, the always literate Lutens looks back on the oriental scents of his past, delivering a tribute to these cornerstones of perfumery written in indulgently pure richness.

Santal Nabataea Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Inspired by the shifting red, pink, and cream layers of the sandstone at Petra, Jordan, Fredrik Dalman wanted to create a perfume that might bring the memory of the 4th century BC Nabataean Kingdom, for whom Petra was the capital city, back to life. A nomadic tribe by nature, Petra was a touchstone for the Nabataeans, and the main focal point of trade in the region. Santal Nabataea honors the inspiration of Petra in two ways: via references to the exotic fruit and spices traded in Petra at the time, and by using certain materials to emulate the dusty, rosy colors and textures of the sandstone of this haunting city. And wow, does it succeed. In exploring the dusty and sometimes astringent heart of true sandalwood, rather than its famously creamy facet, Santal Nabataea is that rare thing â a perfume that smells genuinely exotic in and of itself, rather than simply stuffed with as many exotic notes the perfumer can think of. A pared-back structure demonstrates confidence in its own ability to deliver its message without unnecessary embellishment. All the other notes here exist to showcase the sandal â the black pepper creating a spicy darkness at the back of your throat, the coffee deepening its masculine growl, and the black currant leaf and apricot notes giving off a tannic tea-like nuance that matches the wood in astringency. If it's the brusque, aromatic dryness of real sandalwood that you love, then make sampling Santal Nabataea a priority. Featuring sustainably-sourced santalum album from Australia as well as Indian sandalwood, it's the (rare) real deal.","black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, santalum album sandalwood, sandalwood, coffee",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51730.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired shifting red pink cream layers sandstone petra jordan fredrik dalman wanted create perfume might bring memory th century bc nabataean kingdom petra capital city back life nomadic tribe nature petra touchstone nabataeans main focal point trade region santal nabataea honors inspiration petra two ways via references exotic fruit spices traded petra time using certain materials emulate dusty rosy colors textures sandstone haunting city wow succeed exploring dusty sometimes astringent heart true sandalwood rather famously creamy facet santal nabataea rare thing perfume smells genuinely exotic rather simply stuffed many exotic notes perfumer think pared back structure demonstrates confidence ability deliver message without unnecessary embellishment notes exist showcase sandal black pepper creating spicy darkness back throat coffee deepening masculine growl black currant leaf apricot notes giving tannic tea like nuance matches wood astringency brusque aromatic dryness real sandalwood love make sampling santal nabataea priority featuring sustainably sourced santalum album australia well indian sandalwood rare real deal,"black pepper, black currant leaf, apricot, nerium oleander, opoponax, santalum album sandalwood, sandalwood, coffee"
Tokyo Eau de Parfum,Gallivant,"It's 6 am in Tokyo as you make your way home through the quiet back streets, the air humid with early morning mist. As the electric cables above your head crackle and snap, a strange peace descends on the scene. Tokyo is finally at slumber, or at least in brief repose before gathering itself up again into the manic energy that courses through the city like a pulse. Gallivant's Tokyo captures the moment when Old Tokyo meets New, the sweet smokiness of Japanese incense of Kodo ceremonies spilling out of small wooden temples to meet the sweet-and-sour pungency of izakaya street food. There's a lot going on in Tokyo, the city, and so there's a lot going on in Tokyo, the scent. But despite the cacophony of notes, it all meshes into a singular statement on modern Japanese urban culture. The exciting buzz of yuzu and black pepper in the topnotes conjure the crackle of overhead electric cables swinging softly in the morning breeze, while wasabi, cardamom, and nutmeg lend a dash of complex sour-sweet flavoring to the brew. Tokyo smells intoxicating and strange; otherworldly in the way only exposure to a completely foreign culture can be. Japanese temple incense is the calm at the center of this storm, a cloud of gentle hinoki wood, smoke, and damp flower petals billowing out into the streets as we pass. Before the incense has a chance to turn to powder, a base of exuberantly-spiced ambers, patchouli, sandalwood, and musk moves in to drench the scent in the gold patina of orientalism. This might seem more Arabian-inspired than Japanese at first until you notice that the gentler Japanese accents persist, infiltrating the fog of resin with the aqueous, sweet-and-sour aroma of cardamom, the wasabi, and the silvery ephemerality of hinoki wood. Big city neon energy meets old world Tokyo: this scent brings us straight to the point where they intersect.","yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/766007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tokyo make way home quiet back streets air humid early morning mist electric cables head crackle snap strange peace descends scene tokyo finally slumber least brief repose gathering manic energy courses city like pulse gallivant's tokyo captures moment old tokyo meets new sweet smokiness japanese incense kodo ceremonies spilling small wooden temples meet sweet sour pungency izakaya street food there's lot going tokyo city there's lot going tokyo scent despite cacophony notes meshes singular statement modern japanese urban culture exciting buzz yuzu black pepper topnotes conjure crackle overhead electric cables swinging softly morning breeze wasabi cardamom nutmeg lend dash complex sour sweet flavoring brew tokyo smells intoxicating strange otherworldly way exposure completely foreign culture japanese temple incense calm center storm cloud gentle hinoki wood smoke damp flower petals billowing streets pass incense chance turn powder base exuberantly spiced ambers patchouli sandalwood musk moves drench scent gold patina orientalism might seem arabian inspired japanese first notice gentler japanese accents persist infiltrating fog resin aqueous sweet sour aroma cardamom wasabi silvery ephemerality hinoki wood big city neon energy meets old world tokyo scent brings us straight point intersect,"yuzu, bergamot, black pepper, cardamom, wasabi accord, hinoki, cedarwood, nutmeg, iris, rose, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, amber"

Hemingway Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"Masque Milano has gained a well-earned reputation as a launching pad for young talent- a brand that takes chances on up-and-coming noses and gives them the freedom to discover their creative voices. So when they met IFF trainee Fanny Bal, apprenticing under the legendary Dominique Ropion, and heard of her facility and ingenuity with vetiver, a seed was planted. And who better to dedicate a scent built around vetiver- rough and spicy, earthy and sweet, rich and complex- than Ernest Hemingway? With access to the full resources of the Laboratoire Monique Remy, Bal produces a sweepingly literary tribute to vetiver built from an exquisite vocabulary: woody, dry and spicy Haitian vetiver, with a slight bitterness, provides ideal contrast for the tart rhubarb of the opening. Javan vetiver is dirtier, with smoky tones and leathery facets to blend with the patchouli and leather base. And proprietary Vetiver Heart LMR, which takes hydro-distilled vetiver and puts it through additional fractional distillation to isolate the clean, dry heart of the grassy material without the earthiness, anchors the heart of the fragrance.","ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart lmr, vetiver, java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64009.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,masque milano gained well earned reputation launching pad young talent brand takes chances coming noses gives freedom discover creative voices met iff trainee fanny bal apprenticing legendary dominique ropion heard facility ingenuity vetiver seed planted better dedicate scent built around vetiver rough spicy earthy sweet rich complex ernest hemingway access full resources laboratoire monique remy bal produces sweepingly literary tribute vetiver built exquisite vocabulary woody dry spicy haitian vetiver slight bitterness provides ideal contrast tart rhubarb opening javan vetiver dirtier smoky tones leathery facets blend patchouli leather base proprietary vetiver heart lmr takes hydro distilled vetiver puts additional fractional distillation isolate clean dry heart grassy material without earthiness anchors heart fragrance,"ginger, rhubarb, vetiver heart lmr, vetiver, java vetiver, cedar, patchouli, leather"

Mizu Eau de Parfum,Di Ser,"Mizu, meaning water in Japanese, combines zesty yuzu with spearmint for an aqua seltzer opening that feels like ice water running down your spine. It's the perfect palate cleanser, especially on stupid hot days when your brain seems to stop working. Although Mizu is technically a woody-aromatic citrus, you wouldn't mistake Mizu for a French or American eau de cologne. There's something intrinsically Japanese in its transparency, delicate sourness, and complex use of herbs. Mizu smells exotic, but subtly so. Moving effortlessly from its sparkling spearmint-and-yuzu topnotes to an earthy rosewood and vetiver base, its transitions are as smooth as flowing water. In the heart, it picks up a slight spiciness from the smattering of clovey pinks (carnations) and green cardamom, but it's a subtle accent rather than a plot point. Throughout, the tone is cool and astringent, the unami-rich rosewood and aromatics devoid of anything sweet or thickening. Mizu smells all-natural, because it is all-natural, but a Japanese lightness of touch keeps it from feeling muddy. Instead, Mizu wears like moonlight - peppery, silvery, and buoyant. We're kind of obsessed with this scent here at Luckyscent, because not only does it keep us feeling refreshed on turgid afternoons, but its balance of zesty brightness and earthy sourness keeps us engaged. It's that rare thing âÂ an easy wear that's also whip smart.","yuzu, spearmint, paper pink, cardamom, rosewood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78808.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mizu meaning water japanese combines zesty yuzu spearmint aqua seltzer opening feels like ice water running spine perfect palate cleanser especially stupid hot days brain seems stop working although mizu technically woody aromatic citrus mistake mizu french american eau de cologne there's something intrinsically japanese transparency delicate sourness complex use herbs mizu smells exotic subtly moving effortlessly sparkling spearmint yuzu topnotes earthy rosewood vetiver base transitions smooth flowing water heart picks slight spiciness smattering clovey pinks carnations green cardamom subtle accent rather plot point throughout tone cool astringent unami rich rosewood aromatics devoid anything sweet thickening mizu smells natural natural japanese lightness touch keeps feeling muddy instead mizu wears like moonlight peppery silvery buoyant we're kind obsessed scent luckyscent keep us feeling refreshed turgid afternoons balance zesty brightness earthy sourness keeps us engaged rare thing easy wear that's also whip smart,"yuzu, spearmint, paper pink, cardamom, rosewood, vetiver"

Ruh Eau de Parfum,Pekji,"Ruh, meaning spirit in Sanskrit, is the collective scent of an air-conditioned souk in Turkey, where the delicious aromas of freshly-ground coffee, exotic spices, and incense mingle companionably with the scent of rose attars opened for passers-by. Ruh is exotic in an unfamiliar manner, rearranging traditionally-used notes like rose, coffee, and cardamom in a way that doesn't make you think of every other souk-themed oriental out there. And that's a rare feat. Ruh is rich, but not sweet or heavy. Roast coffee and crushed green cardamom pods pump a fragrant, aromatic freshness through the scent's cells, giving the Turkish rose a spiced wood character that men will love and find easy to wear. A blast of fiery saffron is a further nudge in the direction of masculine, wrapping the lush rose into folds of freshly-tanned leather. But the saffron is the real chameleon of Ruh; it softens in increments from inky iodine to the gently spiced milkiness of kulfi, turning the scent's dial from dry to lush. Breathe in Ruh, close your eyes, and you will feel the soul of the souk all around you, redolent with rich black coffee, piles of red saffron and green cardamom, Turkish leather jackets, and tiny bottles of rose attars opened, sniffed, and dabbed. Yep, Ruh has soul. Luca Turin thought so too, awarding Ruh a 4 star rating in The Perfume Guide (2018).","rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ruh meaning spirit sanskrit collective scent air conditioned souk turkey delicious aromas freshly ground coffee exotic spices incense mingle companionably scent rose attars opened passers ruh exotic unfamiliar manner rearranging traditionally used notes like rose coffee cardamom way make think every souk themed oriental that's rare feat ruh rich sweet heavy roast coffee crushed green cardamom pods pump fragrant aromatic freshness scent's cells giving turkish rose spiced wood character men love find easy wear blast fiery saffron nudge direction masculine wrapping lush rose folds freshly tanned leather saffron real chameleon ruh softens increments inky iodine gently spiced milkiness kulfi turning scent's dial dry lush breathe ruh close eyes feel soul souk around redolent rich black coffee piles red saffron green cardamom turkish leather jackets tiny bottles rose attars opened sniffed dabbed yep ruh soul luca turin thought awarding ruh star rating perfume guide,"rose, coffee, cardamom, saffron, jasmine, oud, musk, amber, sandalwood"
Zeybek Extrait de Parfum,Pekji,"Zeybek, which takes its name from an expressive Aegean dance for a solo male, is an animalic fougere that smells a bit like the minty chewing gum breath of a cowboy as he rakes out a horse stall. The way Zeybek teeters precariously between herbal freshness and smeary funk the whole way through is as electrifying as being plugged into a live socket. For us, Zeybek revolves around a handful of key aromatics that are so complex that they spin the scent off in several directions at once. Narcissus, yes, innocent little daffodil, exudes the fresh greenness of cut stalks, but also facets of soiled hay, civet, and jasmine, which creates a 3D picture of a horse stall. The central 'flowers in a barnyard' accord is freshened up top with salty herbs, lavender, and lemon, for an effect that smells like spearmint gum mixed with sea water. This thrillingly odd combination rests on an equally odd base of industrial notes such as rubber, gum, and putty, all shot through with cigarette ash. Engaging and completely different from anything we've ever smelled before, we'd call Zeybek an animalic fougere that's both resolutely modern and naturalistic in feel. The only cost of entry here is a sense of adventure and the refusal to be hemmed in by convention.","bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,zeybek takes name expressive aegean dance solo male animalic fougere smells bit like minty chewing gum breath cowboy rakes horse stall way zeybek teeters precariously herbal freshness smeary funk whole way electrifying plugged live socket us zeybek revolves around handful key aromatics complex spin scent several directions narcissus yes innocent little daffodil exudes fresh greenness cut stalks also facets soiled hay civet jasmine creates picture horse stall central 'flowers barnyard' accord freshened top salty herbs lavender lemon effect smells like spearmint gum mixed sea water thrillingly odd combination rests equally odd base industrial notes rubber gum putty shot cigarette ash engaging completely different anything we've ever smelled we'd call zeybek animalic fougere that's resolutely modern naturalistic feel cost entry sense adventure refusal hemmed convention,"bergamot, hay, lavender, leather, lemon, musk, narcissus, tobacco, tonka, vetiver"
Odoon Extrait de Parfum,Pekji,"A masterful treatise on a single material, Odoon takes us on a journey through the stored memory cells of a piece of wood, from the depths of the forest to the workshops, from sap to the burnt ashes in the grate of a fire. Odoon is wonderfully rich, balsamic, and warm âÂ full of character and complexity despite its obsessive, almost singular focus. The structure is remarkably uncluttered, focusing on exposing each facet of wood and turning it over for our attention. First, we smell the minty camphor of a freshly bladed log of wood, sap springing up as if startled by its sudden release. Then the roast coffee warmth of cedar, its peppery mealiness exposed to the air for the first time. Slowly, the wood dries out to the caramelic dryness of sandalwood awaiting the carver's tool, where it is polished to a high shine. It all comes together in a wisp of smoke and ash, nuggets of resin in the fine grain catching on fire here and there at the edges. Odoon is warm, deep symphony of wood notes that somehow transcends the simplicity of structure to take on a soul. If you love any of the Comme des Garcons woods-themed fragrances (Wonderwood, Sequoia, Hinoki, and so on), and want to see what a more natural, artisanal take smells like, then get yourself some Odoon.","ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,masterful treatise single material odoon takes us journey stored memory cells piece wood depths forest workshops sap burnt ashes grate fire odoon wonderfully rich balsamic warm full character complexity despite obsessive almost singular focus structure remarkably uncluttered focusing exposing facet wood turning attention first smell minty camphor freshly bladed log wood sap springing startled sudden release roast coffee warmth cedar peppery mealiness exposed air first time slowly wood dries caramelic dryness sandalwood awaiting carver's tool polished high shine comes together wisp smoke ash nuggets resin fine grain catching fire edges odoon warm deep symphony wood notes somehow transcends simplicity structure take soul love comme des garcons woods themed fragrances wonderwood sequoia hinoki want see natural artisanal take smells like get odoon,"ash, cedar, guaiacwood, musk, oak, pepper, pine, resins, sandalwood, vanilla"
Battaniye Extrait de Parfum,Pekji,"Battaniye, meaning blanket in Turkish, is a technically what we might term a comfort scent. Well, you see amber and patchouli, and you draw your own conclusions. But to leave it at that does the scent's enormous complexity a great disservice. Because, although undeniably rich and comforting, Battaniye leans far more towards the dry warmth of textiles âÂ wool, leather, silk âÂ than it does dessert. The perfumer intended for Battaniye to evoke the feeling of watching the rain from a balcony in Trabzon, a mountainous town on the Black Sea, and once an important gateway to Persia on the Spice Route. And it certainly captures the aromas of such a scenario âÂ the scent of rain hitting soil, soot from chimneys, and the oily warmth of an old wool blanket pulled across one's legs to ward off the chill. But for us, Battaniye is all about leather. A spicy, molten core of leather roiling at the heart fuels the scent and gives it a resolutely masculine feel. It morphs slowly from a syrupy wetness that's almost animalic to the dusty warmth of old leather. Surprisingly, for a scent with so many oriental references, Battaniye comes off as distinctly Western, with a cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly at the heart of things. Battaniye is comfort, yes, but it's the comfort of memory and atmosphere, not that of pudding.","amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,battaniye meaning blanket turkish technically might term comfort scent well see amber patchouli draw conclusions leave scent's enormous complexity great disservice although undeniably rich comforting battaniye leans far towards dry warmth textiles wool leather silk dessert perfumer intended battaniye evoke feeling watching rain balcony trabzon mountainous town black sea important gateway persia spice route certainly captures aromas scenario scent rain hitting soil soot chimneys oily warmth old wool blanket pulled across one's legs ward chill us battaniye leather spicy molten core leather roiling heart fuels scent gives resolutely masculine feel morphs slowly syrupy wetness that's almost animalic dusty warmth old leather surprisingly scent many oriental references battaniye comes distinctly western cowboy's dusty leather saddle firmly heart things battaniye comfort yes comfort memory atmosphere pudding,"amber, honeysuckle, java vetiver, labdanum, musk, patchouli, soil, soot, wool"
Eaumer Eau de Parfum,Pekji,"Eaumer, a play on the perfumer's name (O-Mer), is the tonic we'd prescribe to anyone who's ever had a bad experience with an aquatic. Forget what you know about this genre, with its overdose of Calone and potent aromachemicals âÂ Eaumer is here to turn the concept of aquatic on its head and reconfigure all your expectations. When you wear Eaumer, the most pleasant surprise is that a scent can be naturally rather than chemically marine-fresh. Salty anise, lime, and vetiver combine to evoke the brackish freshness of a sea breeze, mercifully free of the melony sweetness common to most aquatics. The lime note sluices everything with an antiseptic brightness that will jolt you awake. The natural gasoline and rubber facets of jasmine are brought forward and accentuated, cleverly creating a petrol-on-sea-water effect that feels novel but also refreshing. When all is said and done, though, ambergris is the rock on which Eaumer is built. Redolent of minty tobacco, minerals, and sea salt, the ambergris fills the scent with a radiant freshness, but also a lingering mammalian funk. And it's this contrast between bright and murky that makes Eaumer such a pleasure to wear on a hot day.","ambergris, anise, bergamot, vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/806001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,eaumer play perfumer's name mer tonic we'd prescribe anyone who's ever bad experience aquatic forget know genre overdose calone potent aromachemicals eaumer turn concept aquatic head reconfigure expectations wear eaumer pleasant surprise scent naturally rather chemically marine fresh salty anise lime vetiver combine evoke brackish freshness sea breeze mercifully free melony sweetness common aquatics lime note sluices everything antiseptic brightness jolt awake natural gasoline rubber facets jasmine brought forward accentuated cleverly creating petrol sea water effect feels novel also refreshing said done though ambergris rock eaumer built redolent minty tobacco minerals sea salt ambergris fills scent radiant freshness also lingering mammalian funk contrast bright murky makes eaumer pleasure wear hot day,"ambergris, anise, bergamot, vetiver, herbs, jasmine, lavender, lime, mastic, musk"
B-612 Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"In Antoine de Saint-Exupery's beloved children's book Le Petit Prince, the titular Prince is the only living being to come from a far-away asteroid known only as B-612. Traveling the universe, the Prince carries with him the spirit of imagination, open-mindedness and inquiry that he cultivated on B-612, and thus, the fragrance named for the asteroid is meant to convey that same spirit- as they put it, ""enlightenment through exploration."" So it should come as no surprise that B-612 is a dynamic, lively, and richly beautiful scent, combining classically aromatic and floral notes of geranium and lavender with a deeply woody heart and a warm, comforting base of oakmoss and tonka bean to create something compellingly timeless. While the result feels sophisticated and masculine, B-612 never loses sight of its joyfully childlike inspiration- this is a scent to wear on adventures, journeys, and new experiences with old friends. The Little Prince has taught generations of readers to hold fast to the wonder and goodwill that far too many lose when approaching adulthood- B-612 is an olfactive reminder that one need never let it go.","lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,antoine de saint exupery's beloved children's book le petit prince titular prince living come far away asteroid known b traveling universe prince carries spirit imagination open mindedness inquiry cultivated b thus fragrance named asteroid meant convey spirit put enlightenment exploration come surprise b dynamic lively richly beautiful scent combining classically aromatic floral notes geranium lavender deeply woody heart warm comforting base oakmoss tonka bean create something compellingly timeless result feels sophisticated masculine b never loses sight joyfully childlike inspiration scent wear adventures journeys new experiences old friends little prince taught generations readers hold fast wonder goodwill far many lose approaching adulthood b olfactive reminder one need never let go,"lavender, geranium, cypress, cashmeran, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, oakmoss, tonka bean"
Vain & Naive Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"""It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.""
The character of the Rose in Le Petit Prince is an extremely important one- she is the Prince's true love, a beautiful, yet flawed companion whose vanity and naivete initially drives the Prince to leave his home asteroid, only for him to ultimately realize that for all her flaws, she is a unique being worthy of his love. With Vain & Naive, Nishane honors the Rose in all her wondrous complexity, delivering an airy, lovely fruity floral rose scent with unforgettable flair. Vain & Naive opens with an arrestingly bright burst of citrus, then quickly introducing the florals at its heart- a rose and jasmine combination both youthfully fresh and romantically lush. Mouthwatering notes of plum and raspberry keep things lively and light, while a gently ambered, woody base glows with soulful depth. The Little Prince ultimately opts to return to his asteroid, and his Flower- for all her vanity and naivete, his love for her is undeniably real and inherently worthwhile. One sniff of Vain & Naive, and you'll never want to leave in the first place.","bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77422.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,time wasted rose makes rose important character rose le petit prince extremely important one prince's true love beautiful yet flawed companion whose vanity naivete initially drives prince leave home asteroid ultimately realize flaws unique worthy love vain naive nishane honors rose wondrous complexity delivering airy lovely fruity floral rose scent unforgettable flair vain naive opens arrestingly bright burst citrus quickly introducing florals heart rose jasmine combination youthfully fresh romantically lush mouthwatering notes plum raspberry keep things lively light gently ambered woody base glows soulful depth little prince ultimately opts return asteroid flower vanity naivete love undeniably real inherently worthwhile one sniff vain naive never want leave first place,"bergamot, orange, rose, jasmine, cedar, plum, raspberry, sandalwood, amber, patchouli, benzoin, tonka bean, musk"
Hyouge Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"6th century tea master Oribe Furuta fiercely adhered to the teaching of Sen Rikyu to â always be different from others' and injected a fearless and liberated sense of beauty into the world of the tea ceremony. His Hyouge (humor) pottery, called Oribe-yaki, with its characteristic dark green and black designs, appears modern, even by today's standards.
As a fragrance designed to honor both the man himself and the exquisite art to which he dedicated his life, Hyouge is a fresh, floral green tea scent with uniquely Japanese nuance.
From the gently powdered green freshness of the very first moments, it's clear that Hyouge is not just a tea scent, nor even just a green tea scent- it's a matcha scent, rich yet subtle, powdery yet bright, with an evocatively complex interplay of softly bitter and sweet notes. Iris and violet further the nuance, eschewing typical floral lushness for a smooth, powdered, gently woodsy base. As you might expect, Hyouge is a quiet scent, but like a true Sado ceremony, there's not a wasted movement- each detail is a touch of perfect, deliberate beauty. Matcha lovers- your new obsession has arrived.

Komorebi Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","Komorebi: a Japanese term that refers to the beauty of natural sunlight filtered through the forest canopy, and the glowing, deciduous effect it creates. It represents a connection between land and sky, with the tree acting as the perfect intermediary, connected closely to both air and earth, a conduit for light, energy, and life itself. Komorebi captures that connection in a gorgeously delicate aromatic floral, combining the bracing freshness of wild mint with a rich, gently sweet bouquet of reseda and mimosa and a blackcurrant note both juicy and aromatic. In the softly powerful base, hazelnut and smooth, lightly powdered tonka bean support a potent central note of oak wood. There are many forest-themed scents, each with their own balance between light and dark, earth, air, and vegetation- but as an impossibly luminous tribute to the forest at its lightest and brightest, Komorebi stands alone.","mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34554.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,komorebi japanese term refers beauty natural sunlight filtered forest canopy glowing deciduous effect creates represents connection land sky tree acting perfect intermediary connected closely air earth conduit light energy life komorebi captures connection gorgeously delicate aromatic floral combining bracing freshness wild mint rich gently sweet bouquet reseda mimosa blackcurrant note juicy aromatic softly powerful base hazelnut smooth lightly powdered tonka bean support potent central note oak wood many forest themed scents balance light dark earth air vegetation impossibly luminous tribute forest lightest brightest komorebi stands alone,"mint, reseda, mimosa, blackcurrant, hazelnut, oak, tonka bean"
Orange X Santal Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"Orange X Santal, literally orange crossed with sandalwood â simple, handsome, and to the point. A radiant composition, the scent focuses on the meeting of a remarkable bitter orange note with the authentic creaminess of santalum album grown sustainably on Australian plantations, the same species of wood that gave us the original Mysore sandalwood. Orange X Santal keeps the structure uncluttered, allowing the raw materials to speak for themselves. The orange turns from juicy pulp to aromatic rind, before settling in a salty, metallic register that feels wonderfully bracing. The aromatic bitterness of the citrus is further underlined by a chorus of dark green notes, chief among them real oakmoss, a rugged cypress, and minty basil, all of which work to lend the scent a chypric tone. The creaminess of the sandalwood in the base is exquisite, but the scent holds fast to its basic character of salty woods, moss, and orange to the end, never ceding to sweetness. Leaning masculine? Yes, we think so. There is something about its brisk, mossy bitterness of Orange X Santal that suits a man, especially if he's wearing a conservative but light summer suit.","bitter orange, basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, santalum album",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,orange x santal literally orange crossed sandalwood simple handsome point radiant composition scent focuses meeting remarkable bitter orange note authentic creaminess santalum album grown sustainably australian plantations species wood gave us original mysore sandalwood orange x santal keeps structure uncluttered allowing raw materials speak orange turns juicy pulp aromatic rind settling salty metallic register feels wonderfully bracing aromatic bitterness citrus underlined chorus dark green notes chief among real oakmoss rugged cypress minty basil work lend scent chypric tone creaminess sandalwood base exquisite scent holds fast basic character salty woods moss orange end never ceding sweetness leaning masculine yes think something brisk mossy bitterness orange x santal suits man especially he's wearing conservative light summer suit,"bitter orange, basil, natural oakmoss absolute, cypress, santalum album"
Rose Magnetic Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"Rose Magnetic is a great example of what Essential Parfums sets out to do, which is to zone in on a great natural material and then hire great perfumers to create a simple but elegant structure where it can shine like a perfectly-polished stone. As addictive as its name suggests, Rose Magnetic takes us on a playful tour through all the fresh, sour, and fruity facets of the rose, before softening into the fluffy almond deliciousness of a Pierre Hermes Ispahan macaron. In the opening, bitter grapefruit and leafy mint play up the spicy herbaciousness of rose, giving rise to the kind of sourness that makes your mouth water. In the heart, the solvent-distilled rose gives way to the lusher Turkish rose absolute, whose pert sweetness is fleshed out with an addictively juicy litchi note. Swirls of creamy musks, vanilla, and natural tonka bean fluff up the cushions in the base, an expanse of creme patisserie that contrasts the berried tartness of the rose to perfection. A pleasure from top to toe, Rose Magnetic shows us what a perfumer can do with a few superb materials and the confidence to keep things simple.","grapefruit, peppermint, rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rose magnetic great example essential parfums sets zone great natural material hire great perfumers create simple elegant structure shine like perfectly polished stone addictive name suggests rose magnetic takes us playful tour fresh sour fruity facets rose softening fluffy almond deliciousness pierre hermes ispahan macaron opening bitter grapefruit leafy mint play spicy herbaciousness rose giving rise kind sourness makes mouth water heart solvent distilled rose gives way lusher turkish rose absolute whose pert sweetness fleshed addictively juicy litchi note swirls creamy musks vanilla natural tonka bean fluff cushions base expanse creme patisserie contrasts berried tartness rose perfection pleasure top toe rose magnetic shows us perfumer superb materials confidence keep things simple,"grapefruit, peppermint, rose absolute, rose extract, lychee, cedar, vanilla, tonka"
Mon Vetiver Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"Mon Vetiver is a surprising and non-traditional vetiver, built on a series of contrasts between bright and dark, natural and synthetic, and modern and traditional, which serve to give this scent a truly distinctive character. Balancing its essentially serious character with the cheerful radiance of woody ambers, wearing Mon Vetiver feels like wearing a Savile Row suit with the lapels turned up. The structure of Mon Vetiver is very clever. It drapes a sparkling gin and tonic accord over a dark, woody fougere-ish base for a play of light on dark that really grabs the attention. The rugged masculinity of vetiver is not hidden away or softened, but rather emphasized by the bitterness of lime and a fistful of pungent herbs - lavender and gentian. The play between natural and synthetic is perfectly pitched here too, the earthy sweetness of natural Indonesian patchouli illuminated and fluffed out by the sweet, musky glow of cashmeran. Woody, earthy, sweet, and expansive, this is a vetiver scent with both manners and swagger.","vetiver, gin accord, mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mon vetiver surprising non traditional vetiver built series contrasts bright dark natural synthetic modern traditional serve give scent truly distinctive character balancing essentially serious character cheerful radiance woody ambers wearing mon vetiver feels like wearing savile row suit lapels turned structure mon vetiver clever drapes sparkling gin tonic accord dark woody fougere ish base play light dark really grabs attention rugged masculinity vetiver hidden away softened rather emphasized bitterness lime fistful pungent herbs lavender gentian play natural synthetic perfectly pitched earthy sweetness natural indonesian patchouli illuminated fluffed sweet musky glow cashmeran woody earthy sweet expansive vetiver scent manners swagger,"vetiver, gin accord, mexican lime, juniper, lavender, gentian, cashmeran, patchouli"
Nice Bergamote Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"Nice Bergamote is indeed a nice bergamot! In fact, we think the name might be underselling it a tad. The juicy sourness of the finest 100% natural Calabrian bergamot extract bursts out of the bottle like a firework, drenching the senses in an icy freshness that feels like liquid sunshine. What's remarkable here is that all the other supporting notes match the bergamot in its naturalness, so they fade in and out of the picture depending on their volatility, as if designed by Mother Nature herself. For example, the soft eddy of natural jasmine and rose petals that swirls up in the heart creates a velvety thickness that steps in when the tartness of the topnote begins to fade. A buttery ylang licks at the edges, adding a fleshy sensuality to the brighter notes, but none of the flower's usual loudness. It's worth noting that the bergamot never disappears completely, only softening from a verdant, limey sourness to a thread of mandarin-like juiciness that runs through the scent, connecting all the parts. The base plays host to a natural tonka bean extract from Venezuela that smells like a golden cream of hay, almonds, and espresso with a shot of milk. The tonka bean accent is subtle, not overly sweet, and is further reined in by a smoky, resinous cedarwood. If you're looking for a natural-smelling bergamot scent that doesn't devolve into the usual white musks or woody ambers, then Nice Bergamot is more than just nice - it's perfect.","bergamot, jasmine grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang-ylang, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nice bergamote indeed nice bergamot fact think name might underselling tad juicy sourness finest natural calabrian bergamot extract bursts bottle like firework drenching senses icy freshness feels like liquid sunshine what's remarkable supporting notes match bergamot naturalness fade picture depending volatility designed mother nature example soft eddy natural jasmine rose petals swirls heart creates velvety thickness steps tartness topnote begins fade buttery ylang licks edges adding fleshy sensuality brighter notes none flower's usual loudness worth noting bergamot never disappears completely softening verdant limey sourness thread mandarin like juiciness runs scent connecting parts base plays host natural tonka bean extract venezuela smells like golden cream hay almonds espresso shot milk tonka bean accent subtle overly sweet reined smoky resinous cedarwood looking natural smelling bergamot scent devolve usual white musks woody ambers nice bergamot nice perfect,"bergamot, jasmine grandiflora extract, natural cedarwood extract, ylang-ylang, tonka bean"
The Musc Eau de Parfum,Essential Parfums,"Every line needs a musk, and this is The Musc, a name that signposts both the brand's sense of humor and the specialness of the scent. Calice Becker said she imagined this scentâÂas a cloud of enveloping and comforting musk', and that's a great way to describe its effect. Wearing The Musc is like stepping out of the freezing cold into a home filled with warmth and love. The Musk operates in the narrow margins between hot and cold â it is fresh and spicy enough to keep you awake, but at the same time, so creamily warm that you'll feel like a cat stretching languorously in front of an open fire. Applied to warm skin, the initial one-two punch of freshly-crushed lavender and red ginger feels spicy and herbal all at once. But copious amounts of Laotian beeswax and Australian santalum album soak the aromatics in a sweet, honeyed creaminess as warming as a lamb's wool throw. These notes â both fresh and warm â are finally swept up into a cloud of whipped musks that wrap the wearer in a velvety cloud of scent. Nirvanolide and Serenolide, both elegantly fruity musks produced by Givaudan, are true to their name here, creating a serene, nirvana-esque fluffiness that's as clean as kitten fur.","ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/803004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,every line needs musk musc name signposts brand's sense humor specialness scent calice becker said imagined scent cloud enveloping comforting musk' that's great way describe effect wearing musc like stepping freezing cold home filled warmth love musk operates narrow margins hot cold fresh spicy enough keep awake time creamily warm feel like cat stretching languorously front open fire applied warm skin initial one two punch freshly crushed lavender red ginger feels spicy herbal copious amounts laotian beeswax australian santalum album soak aromatics sweet honeyed creaminess warming lamb's wool throw notes fresh warm finally swept cloud whipped musks wrap wearer velvety cloud scent nirvanolide serenolide elegantly fruity musks produced givaudan true name creating serene nirvana esque fluffiness that's clean kitten fur,"ginger, beeswax, lavender, sandalwood, musk"

If you've been on the hunt for the perfect leather but been either smothered by an avalanche of powdery florals or slapped around the face by a Cossack's oily winter boot, then breathe a sigh of relief because 'your' leather has finally arrived. Wearing Ombre Leather is like slipping into a pair of the sleekest handmade leather Oxfords in the velvety hush of a store you have to ring a bell to get into.
Enigmatically rich but dry, this is a leather that sings a song of pure, smooth luxury leather, with no excess powder, fruitiness, engine oil, or plasticky saffron to ruin your enjoyment. A touch of violet leaf adds a cool, watery greenness, but overall, this is not a translucent or vegetal leather. Like the ombre effect on a luxury leather jacket, this is a scent that bleeds one note into the next, building to a successively impressive effect â black leather over purple jasmine over earth-brown patchouli over green violets over white moss. As with all truly luxurious accessories, its most impressive feat is its balance â Ombre Leather may be objectively opulent, but even more so, it's undeniably among the most fabulously comfortable leather scents we've ever encountered.","violet leaf, cardamom, jasmine sambac, black leather, white moss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/807000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,true luxury shout hunt perfect leather either smothered avalanche powdery florals slapped around face cossack's oily winter boot breathe sigh relief 'your' leather finally arrived wearing ombre leather like slipping pair sleekest handmade leather oxfords velvety hush store ring bell get enigmatically rich dry leather sings song pure smooth luxury leather excess powder fruitiness engine oil plasticky saffron ruin enjoyment touch violet leaf adds cool watery greenness overall translucent vegetal leather like ombre effect luxury leather jacket scent bleeds one note next building successively impressive effect black leather purple jasmine earth brown patchouli green violets white moss truly luxurious accessories impressive feat balance ombre leather may objectively opulent even undeniably among fabulously comfortable leather scents we've ever encountered,"violet leaf, cardamom, jasmine sambac, black leather, white moss, patchouli"
Imitation Man,Amouage,"One moment, one sensory experience, can completely alter a child's perception of the world. For Amouage Creative Director Christopher Chong, that moment happened the first time he experienced New York City as a child in the 1970's- the vibrant street culture, the breathtaking diversity, and the very sights, sounds and smells of the greatest city in the world during a tumultuous and consequential era threw open a door to life's infinite possibilities. Imitation is his attempt to capture that vibrancy. Imitation Man represents '70s NYC in bold, sensual, refined leather tones, opening with electric citrus and tingling spices that evoke blinding sunshine on bustling asphalt streets. The leather at the center of the fragrance is rich, soft suede, refined with lush rose, buttery orris and bright violet. An atmospheric base of spicy, smoky, animalic notes gives the thrilling authenticity of a smoke filled discotheque. Imitation Man will take you away to a time and place of chaos and beauty- and the endless adventures that follow.","citron, nutmeg, black pepper, rose, orris, violet, myrrh, leather, vetiver, patchouli, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41892.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one moment one sensory experience completely alter child's perception world amouage creative director christopher chong moment happened first time experienced new york city child 's vibrant street culture breathtaking diversity sights sounds smells greatest city world tumultuous consequential era threw open door life's infinite possibilities imitation attempt capture vibrancy imitation man represents ' nyc bold sensual refined leather tones opening electric citrus tingling spices evoke blinding sunshine bustling asphalt streets leather center fragrance rich soft suede refined lush rose buttery orris bright violet atmospheric base spicy smoky animalic notes gives thrilling authenticity smoke filled discotheque imitation man take away time place chaos beauty endless adventures follow,"citron, nutmeg, black pepper, rose, orris, violet, myrrh, leather, vetiver, patchouli, castoreum"

Dent de Lait Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"We often look back on milestone events from our childhood with great poignancy, recalling the feeling of innocence and wonder, and the moment that feeling begins to change. Dent de Lait is just that, a poignant celebration one of our earliest rights of passage during that most magical period of our lives. The loss of one's baby teeth serves as a metaphor for and a harbinger of the inevitable march toward adolescence, and this fragrance captures it with great aplomb. A flash of metallic zing opens bracingly, conjuring the slightly metallic flavor of the void where a baby tooth once roosted. The quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way to a creamy-soft and reassuring smoothness through the deft use of almond milk, coconut and floral aldehydes, transporting you to that moment just before you began to trade your innocence for wisdom.
Creamy, smooth and ultimately reassuring, this gourmand is imbued with a sense of cloistered security, connecting us to that comforting feeling we enjoyed when we were young.","almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36161.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,often look back milestone events childhood great poignancy recalling feeling innocence wonder moment feeling begins change dent de lait poignant celebration one earliest rights passage magical period lives loss one's baby teeth serves metaphor harbinger inevitable march toward adolescence fragrance captures great aplomb flash metallic zing opens bracingly conjuring slightly metallic flavor void baby tooth roosted quick yet subtle bitterness slowly gives way creamy soft reassuring smoothness deft use almond milk coconut floral aldehydes transporting moment began trade innocence wisdom creamy smooth ultimately reassuring gourmand imbued sense cloistered security connecting us comforting feeling enjoyed young,"almond milk, coconut, incense, heliotrope, slight metallic note"
Cap Neroli Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"One of the most memorable aspects of the thoroughly gorgeous Cote d'Azur is the ubiquitous presence of orange trees, splashing the landscape with vivid color and perfuming the air with their beautiful scent. From a single tree, aromas of bright citrus, fresh woods, and smooth, creamy flowers float on the breeze, and when it comes to harvesting scented ingredients for perfumery, the versatility becomes astounding- one humble tree produces everything from bitter, spicy petitgrain to enchantingly smooth orange blossom absolute. Cap Neroli features every aspect of the Cote d'Azur's fabled orange trees, opening with a contrast of bitter petitgrain and sweet mandarin given a fresh aquatic shimmer via rosemary and mint. A heart of bright neroli and soft orange flower is enhanced with sweet ylang and fresh jasmine, all resting on a bed of fresh musks and oakmoss that linger for hours. It's a perfect tribute to a place of staggering beauty, and the ideal summer scent for just about anyone looking to bring a bit of the French Riviera with them wherever they go.","petitgrain, orange, mandarin, rosemary, mint, neroli, ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange flower, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/313058.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one memorable aspects thoroughly gorgeous cote d'azur ubiquitous presence orange trees splashing landscape vivid color perfuming air beautiful scent single tree aromas bright citrus fresh woods smooth creamy flowers float breeze comes harvesting scented ingredients perfumery versatility becomes astounding one humble tree produces everything bitter spicy petitgrain enchantingly smooth orange blossom absolute cap neroli features every aspect cote d'azur's fabled orange trees opening contrast bitter petitgrain sweet mandarin given fresh aquatic shimmer via rosemary mint heart bright neroli soft orange flower enhanced sweet ylang fresh jasmine resting bed fresh musks oakmoss linger hours perfect tribute place staggering beauty ideal summer scent anyone looking bring bit french riviera wherever go,"petitgrain, orange, mandarin, rosemary, mint, neroli, ylang-ylang, jasmine, orange flower, oakmoss, musk"
Fougere d'Argent Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Fougere d'Argent is a bold reimagining of the classic fougere, a structure that traditionally revolves around lavender, oakmoss, and coumarin. With oakmoss no longer available, Tom Ford has re-worked the model in a provocative manner, substituting moss with Akigalawood, a Givaudan captive derived from patchouli that has a wonderfully spicy, woodsy bitterness. What emerges from Ford's confident handling is a scent that smells truly masculine â earthy, herbaceous, and rich, with a radiantly spiced muskiness that billows around its wearer. If there's a scent that sums up everything that is great about old-school-meets-modern-cool masculine grooming, then it's probably fougere d'Argent. The aromatic topnotes of lavender, ginger, and citrus notes give off a formal Savile Row vibe, with the sort of soapy, minty freshness one expects to emanate from a gentleman wearing an impeccably-tailored suit. Akigalawood stands in most competently for the traditional oakmoss, its spicy, mossy sharpness softened by the buttery labdanum amber tucked away into a corner. What marks out this fougere as a particularly modern twist on an old format is its use of coumarin. Whereas in traditional fougeres, the coumarin adds a dry hay-like grassiness, here the coumarin is taken in a sultrier, more oriental direction, emphasizing the musky sweetness of the tonka bean from whence the coumarin was extracted. Fans of aromatic lavender-tonka fragrances ranging from Gris Clair to Tom Ford's own Fucking Fabulous will likely love fougere d'Argent for its bold updating of the fougere structure, but others appreciate it even more for its total lack of gourmandise. Dry, masculine, and admirably unsweet, fougere d'Argent is for the man who effortlessly exudes confidence, no matter what he's wearing or doing.","mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, akigalawood, coumarin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63568.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fougere d'argent bold reimagining classic fougere structure traditionally revolves around lavender oakmoss coumarin oakmoss longer available tom ford worked model provocative manner substituting moss akigalawood givaudan captive derived patchouli wonderfully spicy woodsy bitterness emerges ford's confident handling scent smells truly masculine earthy herbaceous rich radiantly spiced muskiness billows around wearer there's scent sums everything great old school meets modern cool masculine grooming probably fougere d'argent aromatic topnotes lavender ginger citrus notes give formal savile row vibe sort soapy minty freshness one expects emanate gentleman wearing impeccably tailored suit akigalawood stands competently traditional oakmoss spicy mossy sharpness softened buttery labdanum amber tucked away corner marks fougere particularly modern twist old format use coumarin whereas traditional fougeres coumarin adds dry hay like grassiness coumarin taken sultrier oriental direction emphasizing musky sweetness tonka bean whence coumarin extracted fans aromatic lavender tonka fragrances ranging gris clair tom ford's fucking fabulous likely love fougere d'argent bold updating fougere structure others appreciate even total lack gourmandise dry masculine admirably unsweet fougere d'argent man effortlessly exudes confidence matter he's wearing,"mandarin, ginger, lavender, cistus, akigalawood, coumarin"
Live In Colors Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"The perfect citrus is an elusive thing. Pretty much the Holy Grail of perfumery, in fact. Citrus notes are so volatile that the perfumer has to figure out how to keep them aloft and keep the scent smelling natural all the way through, a balancing act that's far harder than you might imagine. We're happy to report that Live in Colors pulls it off. It sparkles from top to bottom, without losing momentum along the way. In other words, this is the new summer freshie to beat. The fizz of the opening is invigorating, with a burst of lemon and grapefruit so sharp you can taste it. It smells like an entire citrus tree pulped down and squeezed into the bottle, with everything from leaf to pulp and rind. The scent then deftly switches the charge to aromatics, running the juice over a bed of pink pepper and ginger root to keep those volatile citrus notes alive. There's a wonderful hot-cold effect going on in the background, the juicy sweetness of red fruit rubbing up against the coldness of spice. In the base, a soft, silvery hinoki wood supports the more aromatic notes but doesn't impose its own personality as insistently as cedar or gaiac. Live in Colors doesn't so much end as fade out gently, in a musky-woody trail that stays soft and clean. It's not a projection monster and it won't break any longevity records. But a citrus scent doesn't need to perform acrobatics to please us â it just needs to smell fresh and natural. And in that respect, Live in Colors scores a perfect 10.","lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76421.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perfect citrus elusive thing pretty much holy grail perfumery fact citrus notes volatile perfumer figure keep aloft keep scent smelling natural way balancing act that's far harder might imagine we're happy report live colors pulls sparkles top bottom without losing momentum along way words new summer freshie beat fizz opening invigorating burst lemon grapefruit sharp taste smells like entire citrus tree pulped squeezed bottle everything leaf pulp rind scent deftly switches charge aromatics running juice bed pink pepper ginger root keep volatile citrus notes alive there's wonderful hot cold effect going background juicy sweetness red fruit rubbing coldness spice base soft silvery hinoki wood supports aromatic notes impose personality insistently cedar gaiac live colors much end fade gently musky woody trail stays soft clean projection monster break longevity records citrus scent need perform acrobatics please us needs smell fresh natural respect live colors scores perfect,"lemon, grapefruit, red fruits, ginger, pink pepper, musk, hinoki wood, amber"
Just Before Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Just Before revolves around Palo Santo, the so-called 'Holy Wood' burned by the Incas and shamans to cleanse the spirit. The wood itself is sweetly fragrant with notes of pine, lemon, and mint, features the perfumers have cleverly chosen to accentuate with an equally bright trio of bergamot, lemon, and saffron, which melts effortlessly into the wood, leaving a film of orangey spice glittering on its pale, blond surface. It smells like citrus peel and cinnamon left to smolder on top of a freshly-lit piece of Palo Santo incense â smoky, but with a lively sparkle. A rich, banana-ish ylang is a dollop of butter stirred into the cake, thickening the fragrance, and easing the woods and citruses into the spiced doughiness of benzoin. The contrast between the minty aromatics and the vanilla-sodden resins gives the scent an interesting bitter almond nuance that's not too far off the Hypnotic Poison model. But what really stands out here for us is the myrrh. Redolent of earth, wet stones, and anise, this ancient resin adds enormous depth, as well as a sepulchral darkness that contrasts the scent's more gourmand 'patisserie' elements. Delicious and almost edible in its spicy warmth, Just Before teeters precariously between incense, amber, and woods. But because it never tips over into any one category, it remains interesting. Sugar and spice and all things nice....Just Before is a seductive siren call, calling out to us like the proverbial gingerbread cottage in the forest.","bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76423.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,revolves around palo santo called 'holy wood' burned incas shamans cleanse spirit wood sweetly fragrant notes pine lemon mint features perfumers cleverly chosen accentuate equally bright trio bergamot lemon saffron melts effortlessly wood leaving film orangey spice glittering pale blond surface smells like citrus peel cinnamon left smolder top freshly lit piece palo santo incense smoky lively sparkle rich banana ish ylang dollop butter stirred cake thickening fragrance easing woods citruses spiced doughiness benzoin contrast minty aromatics vanilla sodden resins gives scent interesting bitter almond nuance that's far hypnotic poison model really stands us myrrh redolent earth wet stones anise ancient resin adds enormous depth well sepulchral darkness contrasts scent's gourmand 'patisserie' elements delicious almost edible spicy warmth teeters precariously incense amber woods never tips one category remains interesting sugar spice things nice seductive siren call calling us like proverbial gingerbread cottage forest,"bergamot, lemon, saffron, palo santo, ylang-ylang, myrrh, vanilla, benzoin, amber, sandalwood"
I Don't Know What Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Among the first things aspiring perfumers learn is that the most important ingredients in the construction of a scent are the invisible ones- the aromachemicals and extremely subtle naturals that don't stand out to the nose, but nevertheless add crucial space, depth and structure to the fragrance. Even the finest floral extracts or precious woods depend on this structure to avoid feeling flattened-out, condensed or overpowering, but to the casual fragrance fan, the contributions of these delicate ""spacing"" notes goes completely unappreciated- until now. I Don't Know What is a minimalist scent in the compelling tradition of Escentric Molecules, able to be worn alone as a sheer, ethereal hint of citrus, musks and woods, but designed to layer beneath any scent you can imagine- fragrance oils, other perfumes, a favorite extract- boosting power, adding radiance, and generally enhancing absolutely anything it touches.

Hindu Kush,Mancera,"Rugged, imposing, and central to military history both ancient and modern, the Hindu Kush mountain range in Central Asia is a formidable sight indeed. It's a border not merely between Pakistan and Afghanistan, but between heaven and earth itself. To honor this wild location, Mancera presents a uniquely resinous scent, rich with spice and incense, perfect for the adventurous spirit in all of us. Hindu Kush opens with a sweet and complex layer of exotic spice, with prominent notes of saffron and clove reinforced with the energy of black pepper and the earthy resinousness of another famed export of the region- a cannabis essential oil harvested from authentic Afghan-grown plants. Oud, patchouli and woods dominate the heart, but their heaviest and darkest tones are played down, keeping the robust spiciness at the center of the composition. A vanilla and musk base works along the same concept, reinforcing the resins and spices without drowning them in overly rich or earthy tones and presenting Hindu Kush as that rarest of oriental fragrances- one with more subtlety than opulence. And as a result, it's hard to think of a human being alive that wouldn't smell unbelievable wearing it.","saffron, cumin, cloves, black pepper, labdanum, davana, cannabis, agarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, white musk, gaiac, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64933.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rugged imposing central military history ancient modern hindu kush mountain range central asia formidable sight indeed border merely pakistan afghanistan heaven earth honor wild location mancera presents uniquely resinous scent rich spice incense perfect adventurous spirit us hindu kush opens sweet complex layer exotic spice prominent notes saffron clove reinforced energy black pepper earthy resinousness another famed export region cannabis essential oil harvested authentic afghan grown plants oud patchouli woods dominate heart heaviest darkest tones played keeping robust spiciness center composition vanilla musk base works along concept reinforcing resins spices without drowning overly rich earthy tones presenting hindu kush rarest oriental fragrances one subtlety opulence result hard think human alive smell unbelievable wearing,"saffron, cumin, cloves, black pepper, labdanum, davana, cannabis, agarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, amber, white musk, gaiac, vanilla"

Hyrax Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Climbing to its perch in the morning sky, the African sun reaches across a mountain range to caress a wide, flat boulder, baking it to a gentle heat. From the shade of a narrow crevice, a family of hyrax emerges, hot dust dulling the sheen of their golden fur. They settle onto the warm expanse of rock to partake in their ritual sunbath, but remain ever vigilant. The shadow of a soaring eagle rushes across the ground. With an urgent squeal, the alarm is sounded - the colony dashes for cover. As the heat from sweltering sun intensifies, ancient aromas are coaxed from the scorched rocks, sparse vegetation and petrified hyraceum. Eerily, they intertwine to form a scent that is both primitive and exotic, its animalistic tendencies tamed by an undercurrent of sweet florals.At the heart of Zoologist Hyrax is a daring, seldom-used ingredient in the art of perfumery â African stone, or hyraceum, giving this bold animalic scent its distinctive signature. This unique perfume skillfully blends saffron, pink pepper, whiskey, rose and musks to invoke an abstract image of a dusty African mountainscape. Like the nimble hyraxes that spill from hillside crevices in search of the sun upon their musky hides, this scent will weave its way into your senses with a light but primal touch.","blackberry, elemi, pink pepper, saffron, rose, stone, hyacinth, styrax, whiskey, amber, benzoin, musk, patchouli, sandalwood, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,climbing perch morning sky african sun reaches across mountain range caress wide flat boulder baking gentle heat shade narrow crevice family hyrax emerges hot dust dulling sheen golden fur settle onto warm expanse rock partake ritual sunbath remain ever vigilant shadow soaring eagle rushes across ground urgent squeal alarm sounded colony dashes cover heat sweltering sun intensifies ancient aromas coaxed scorched rocks sparse vegetation petrified hyraceum eerily intertwine form scent primitive exotic animalistic tendencies tamed undercurrent sweet florals heart zoologist hyrax daring seldom used ingredient art perfumery african stone hyraceum giving bold animalic scent distinctive signature unique perfume skillfully blends saffron pink pepper whiskey rose musks invoke abstract image dusty african mountainscape like nimble hyraxes spill hillside crevices search sun upon musky hides scent weave way senses light primal touch,"blackberry, elemi, pink pepper, saffron, rose, stone, hyacinth, styrax, whiskey, amber, benzoin, musk, patchouli, sandalwood, tonka"
Bois Dore Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels,"Fine fragrance has a stunning ability to represent myth and poetry in vivid reality- to make the conceptual come to olfactive life. In Bois Dore, Fabrice Pellegrin envisions a fantastical Golden Wood, glowing with rich woods, delectable spice and smooth tonka bean. While the core of the scent is undeniably the interplay between the velvety, robust wood notes and a powdered, vanilla-inflected tonka bean, the beauty of Bois Dore manifests itself in its remarkable versatility- fans of Tom Ford Tobacco Vanille and Penhaligon's Roaring Radcliff will find that a supporting note of tobacco imbues a familiar strain of regal, masculine texture, while the powderiness of the tonka and a distinctly sweet almond maintain a warm, feminine sensuality. And no matter your persuasions, a long-lasting tingle of black pepper and a salty mineralic note provide a unique and energizing sparkle. While not every fragrance lives up to its concept, we're thrilled to report that Bois Dore is every bit the luminous, fantastical Golden Wood we were promised.","black pepper, mineral notes, cedar, vanilla, tobacco, almond, tonka, musk, teak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50210.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fine fragrance stunning ability represent myth poetry vivid reality make conceptual come olfactive life bois dore fabrice pellegrin envisions fantastical golden wood glowing rich woods delectable spice smooth tonka bean core scent undeniably interplay velvety robust wood notes powdered vanilla inflected tonka bean beauty bois dore manifests remarkable versatility fans tom ford tobacco vanille penhaligon's roaring radcliff find supporting note tobacco imbues familiar strain regal masculine texture powderiness tonka distinctly sweet almond maintain warm feminine sensuality matter persuasions long lasting tingle black pepper salty mineralic note provide unique energizing sparkle every fragrance lives concept we're thrilled report bois dore every bit luminous fantastical golden wood promised,"black pepper, mineral notes, cedar, vanilla, tobacco, almond, tonka, musk, teak"

Blending sharp, vibrant citrus with a richly, unabashedly powdered romantic floral heart, atop a sensual base of musks, woods and vanillas. But in reality, describing the individual notes feels incomplete somehow, as the real achievement of Pikovaya Dama is a sumptuously blended, wholly pervasive atmosphere of vintage grandeur, where the pillow-soft powder, luscious florals and deep musky base all exist simultaneously, exuding a soulfully resonant aura that only strengthens as it wears.

Amber Intense Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"The oriental, reinvented. When Fragrance du Bois set their sights on amber as a main component for their newest Prive release, our expectations- and imaginations- were sky high. After all, the Prive line is defined by exceedingly rare ingredients, including their proprietary 100% organic vintage oud, as well as a willingness to simultaneously embrace and defy convention, to deliver scents that knew when to follow traditional structure, and when to take bold risks. To that end, Amber Intense is certainly an amber scent- loaded with rich, resinous, balsamic fullness- but with its spicy, floral complexity, it's also so much more. Amber Intense opens with a spice and citrus laden burst, where notes of bergamot, tangerine, black pepper and cinnamon pop and fizz with vibrant energy. As the rich floral heart unfolds, an exquisite blend of rose, jasmine and neroli captives against the rich amber accord, a warmly resinous blend of styrax, labdanum and patchouli that doubles down with enduring base notes of benzoin and peru balsam alongside Fragrance du Bois' unparalleled vintage oud. The result is a scent that's rich but never heavy, complex but never confusing, with an undeniably confident elegance. Whether you approach Amber Intense from the perspective of an amber lover or that of a connoisseur of spicy orientals, you're sure to find your new signature scent.","bergamot, tangerine, orange, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, saffron, neroli, rose, jasmine, blackcurrant, patchouli, styrax, cistus, benzoin, balsam, musk, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75723.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oriental reinvented fragrance du bois set sights amber main component newest prive release expectations imaginations sky high prive line defined exceedingly rare ingredients including proprietary organic vintage oud well willingness simultaneously embrace defy convention deliver scents knew follow traditional structure take bold risks end amber intense certainly amber scent loaded rich resinous balsamic fullness spicy floral complexity also much amber intense opens spice citrus laden burst notes bergamot tangerine black pepper cinnamon pop fizz vibrant energy rich floral heart unfolds exquisite blend rose jasmine neroli captives rich amber accord warmly resinous blend styrax labdanum patchouli doubles enduring base notes benzoin peru balsam alongside fragrance du bois' unparalleled vintage oud result scent that's rich never heavy complex never confusing undeniably confident elegance whether approach amber intense perspective amber lover connoisseur spicy orientals sure find new signature scent,"bergamot, tangerine, orange, black pepper, cinnamon, cumin, saffron, neroli, rose, jasmine, blackcurrant, patchouli, styrax, cistus, benzoin, balsam, musk, oud"
Moth Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Their days are spent secluded in camouflage, the intricate pattern of their wings disguising them against a coarse backdrop of barks and rocks. When they finally stir, even their flight is concealed, shrouded beneath the cover of night. Moonlight ripples off a delicate coating of tiny hairs as their feathered antennae guide them in their search for a mate. Only one temptation can lure them from their quest. Should they succumb to the attraction of the flame, their urge to procreate may be quashed in a wisp of smoke and a smattering of ashes. At first encounter, the rich, gothic scent of Zoologist Moth may surprise but soon it hypnotizes. A heavy dose of dark spices jolts your senses before settling into a dusting of honey-sweet rose and dark, inky florals. Slowly, it tests its wings, taking flight on an exotic journey of nagarmotha, guaiac wood and patchouli. Beneath it all lingers a smoky undertone that serves as a constant reminder of the danger within the tantalizing flame.","black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76018.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,days spent secluded camouflage intricate pattern wings disguising coarse backdrop barks rocks finally stir even flight concealed shrouded beneath cover night moonlight ripples delicate coating tiny hairs feathered antennae guide search mate one temptation lure quest succumb attraction flame urge procreate may quashed wisp smoke smattering ashes first encounter rich gothic scent zoologist moth may surprise soon hypnotizes heavy dose dark spices jolts senses settling dusting honey sweet rose dark inky florals slowly tests wings taking flight exotic journey nagarmotha guaiac wood patchouli beneath lingers smoky undertone serves constant reminder danger within tantalizing flame,"black pepper, cinnamon, clove, cumin, lemon, nutmeg, saffron, heliotrope, iris, jasmine, mimosa, muguet, rose, ambergris, honey, resins, gaiac, musk, nagarmotha, oud, patchouli, smoke, vetiver"
Unsettled Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"Since when does the end of the world smell so pleasant? It's a fair question if your first exposure to Unsettled was the hand-blown flacon originally commissioned by the Nevada Museum of Art: an atomic blast shaped container that literally glowed green from the uranium glass used to craft it. So it's something of a surprise that the scent itself is downright happy- a fresh, creamy sandalwood brightened even more with mouthwatering pineapple and smooth black tea. The result is a wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent that feels like a day on the beach- smooth, easy to wear, and almost hypnotically relaxing. It's the kind of fragrance that would make an effortless signature- it's hard to imagine a circumstance or person it wouldn't smell amazing on. It's Bruno's clever way of juxtaposing the occasionally- but consequentially- overlapping histories of Nevada and the South Pacific. No, your bottle won't be made of uranium glass- we're pretty sure that wouldn't be a big hit with our shippers- but one spritz and you won't be worried about a thing.","spicy, sweet, sparkling musk, ocean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69311.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,since end world smell pleasant fair question first exposure unsettled hand blown flacon originally commissioned nevada museum art atomic blast shaped container literally glowed green uranium glass used craft something surprise scent downright happy fresh creamy sandalwood brightened even mouthwatering pineapple smooth black tea result wonderfully unisex sandalwood scent feels like day beach smooth easy wear almost hypnotically relaxing kind fragrance would make effortless signature hard imagine circumstance person smell amazing bruno's clever way juxtaposing occasionally consequentially overlapping histories nevada south pacific bottle made uranium glass we're pretty sure big hit shippers one spritz worried thing,"spicy, sweet, sparkling musk, ocean"
Viper Green Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"There's something inherently dangerous about green scents. Yes, they're fresh and vibrant, but lurking behind that freshness is a sense of wildness, of instinctual, uncontrollable nature. This dangerous, seductive side of green is what gives us Viper Green, a new unisex floral from Ex Nihilo that feels thrillingly, poisonously sexy. Opening with a flash of bright green mandarin backed up with crisp angelica and bitingly fresh galbanum, we can tell from the very start that this is really and truly a green scent, thorns and all. A floral heart of iris adds dry, cool elegance, while spiky vetiver and deep, earthy patchouli are rich and imposing with primordial power.

1885 Bains Sulfureux Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois,"While the legendary Bains Guerbois has undergone many transformations in its 133 years of life, it began as a temple of beauty and well-being, a renowned spa and bathhouse that played host to Belle Epoque luminaries from Renoir to Proust. 1885 Bains Sulfureux is an evocation of those early glory days, when an open door would release the aromas of thousands of essences of plants, herbs and flowers, carried on the warm steam of those legendary Turkish and Russian baths. After opening with invigorating top notes of juicy mandarin and bergamot, alongside herbaceous rosemary and blackcurrant leaf, a fresh floral heart of orange blossom and jasmine feels as soothingly lush as an infused soaking tub.

2013 Residence d'Artistes Eau de Parfum,Les Bains Guerbois,"For a brief moment before it was transformed into a boutique luxury hotel, the Les Bains space was given a unique form of rehabilitation- Paris' most accomplished and admired street artists were moved in to live there for several weeks, with the freedom to pursue whatever artistic goals they desired.

Hallucinogenic Pearl Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"While no serious fragrance enthusiast would ever question the luxuriousness of orris butter- the rich, earthy-creamy depth, the papyrus-like smoothness- it's fair to ask a simpler question: is it any fun?

Perhaps that's why we love Hallucinogenic Pearl so much- preternaturally light-on-its-feet, it's an orris-based stunner that deploys fresh musks and smooth leather to conjure up a higher, happier plane of existence where orris is not only sophisticated, but sparkling.

But the man-made elements of the hotel are every bit as magical- case in point, the grand, dreamlike Champagne Bar, which winds from beautifully contoured interior out onto an enchanting terrace replete with charming mosaic work and a variety of night-blooming jasmine plants, who release their intoxicating scent into the warm evening air, creamy, fresh and seductive. This is the inspiration behind Fior Fiore, summer nights on the terrace, surrounded by flowers, the day's sun a faint glow beyond the horizon.

Terra Mia Eau de Parfum,Carthusia,"Carthusia has long held a well-earned reputation for their ability to capture the olfactory beauty of the Italian landscape- azure sea, juicy citrus, wild aromatic vegetation, and shining sun. But Terra Mia, a rare Carthusia gourmand, seems more inspired by the simple joys of traditional Italian life and culture- gatherings in the village square, puppet shows, fresh flowers in the market, and steaming cups of espresso. So while it opens with wonderful freshness- tart bergamot, bright pink pepper- the grand players here are warmer, deeper notes- mouthwatering hazelnut, sweet orange blossom, lush rose, and robust coffee, all set against a resinously ambered wood base both rich and soothing. As with all Carthusia scents, we feel transported, but this time we're in an ancient piazza full of life and laughter, an espresso in hand, joy in our hearts. We might not have grown up in Italy, but one sniff of Terra Mia and you'll agree- it feels like home.","bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52919.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,carthusia long held well earned reputation ability capture olfactory beauty italian landscape azure sea juicy citrus wild aromatic vegetation shining sun terra mia rare carthusia gourmand seems inspired simple joys traditional italian life culture gatherings village square puppet shows fresh flowers market steaming cups espresso opens wonderful freshness tart bergamot bright pink pepper grand players warmer deeper notes mouthwatering hazelnut sweet orange blossom lush rose robust coffee set resinously ambered wood base rich soothing carthusia scents feel transported time we're ancient piazza full life laughter espresso hand joy hearts might grown italy one sniff terra mia agree feels like home,"bergamot, neroli, pink pepper, rose, jasmine, coffee, hazelnut, orange blossom, vanilla, amber woods"
Nudiflorum Extrait de Parfum,Nasomatto,"Natural. Primitive. Sensual. These are the words that Nasomatto chooses to provide, instead of a notes list, to represent Nudiflorum. One sniff and you'll see why any notes would ultimately feel inadequate- of course, it's driven by florals as the name might suggest, but these are bold, impressionistic, and shockingly intimate florals- brighter, lusher and more vivid than a straight-up reproduction, with a compellingly skinlike musk surrounding them, at times innocent and youthful, at others carnal, animalic and deeply seductive, eventually gaining a smoky and woodsy edge with which Nasomatto fans will be well acquainted. It's olfactory intimacy, the kind of scent you must experience to understand its raw power and seductive tranquility. Most simply put, Nudiflorum is the kind of sensual fragrance that only Nasomatto could ever produce.","jasmine, smoke, bergamot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41013.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,natural primitive sensual words nasomatto chooses provide instead notes list represent nudiflorum one sniff see notes would ultimately feel inadequate course driven florals name might suggest bold impressionistic shockingly intimate florals brighter lusher vivid straight reproduction compellingly skinlike musk surrounding times innocent youthful others carnal animalic deeply seductive eventually gaining smoky woodsy edge nasomatto fans well acquainted olfactory intimacy kind scent must experience understand raw power seductive tranquility simply put nudiflorum kind sensual fragrance nasomatto could ever produce,"jasmine, smoke, bergamot"
Erawan Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"Erawan is the scent of late summer tipping into fall. It is the smell of the harvest, with fields of aromatic barley, hay, and oats waiting to be brought in, the earthy goodness of nuts, flour, and honey stacked high in the larder, and the wholesome, leaf-brownness of tobacco leaves drying on barn floors. It is not an uncommon theme in indie perfumery, but Erawan stands proud of other examples by way of two things. First, Dusita's sophisticated style of making perfumes puts a high-definition gloss on the rustic theme, making it the perfect choice for a young Paris or New York sophisticate who wants real, but who also wants polished. Second, whereas most fragrances with a countryside bent are loaded with syrupy sweetness, booze, or fruit, Erawan boasts only the gentle sweetness of nuts, hay, and herbs, thus making it an airy, elegant wear. A series of little contrasts has been cleverly worked into the composition to give the scent texture and movement. There is the herbal brightness of clary sage and petigrain up top, but also a nutty, creamy undercurrent of vetiver to provide depth. Liatris, or deertongue, a plant extract that lends perfumes a coumarin-like tone, gives off the scent of freshly-toasted tobacco leaf, but its dry resinousness is nicely offset by the damp, fresh greenery of a surprising muguet note planted in the center. The inky bitterness of oakmoss is suggestive of long shadows under oak trees, but a judicious dose of vanilla softens everything into a delicious, late-afternoon blur. Erawan wears like a ray of sunshine on your face. Both beautiful and unusual, its rustic charm does not come at the cost of sophistication.","herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,erawan scent late summer tipping fall smell harvest fields aromatic barley hay oats waiting brought earthy goodness nuts flour honey stacked high larder wholesome leaf brownness tobacco leaves drying barn floors uncommon theme indie perfumery erawan stands proud examples way two things first dusita's sophisticated style making perfumes puts high definition gloss rustic theme making perfect choice young paris new york sophisticate wants real also wants polished second whereas fragrances countryside bent loaded syrupy sweetness booze fruit erawan boasts gentle sweetness nuts hay herbs thus making airy elegant wear series little contrasts cleverly worked composition give scent texture movement herbal brightness clary sage petigrain top also nutty creamy undercurrent vetiver provide depth liatris deertongue plant extract lends perfumes coumarin like tone gives scent freshly toasted tobacco leaf dry resinousness nicely offset damp fresh greenery surprising muguet note planted center inky bitterness oakmoss suggestive long shadows oak trees judicious dose vanilla softens everything delicious late afternoon blur erawan wears like ray sunshine face beautiful unusual rustic charm come cost sophistication,"herbal notes, petitgrain, lily-of-the-valley, vetiver, hay, clary sage, liatris (deertongue), cedar, oakmoss, vanilla"
Fleur de Lalita Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"Fleur de Lalita is a bouquet of tropical flowers that has grown up, moved to France, and taken up smoking and reading Baudelaire. Peel back the layers and you'll see that its core of lush ylang ylang, tropical lilies, and magnolia remains intact. But bookended by a smoky galbanum up top and salty, lived-in ambergris down below, Fleur de Lalita is definitely a floral for adults. The playoff between milky sweetness of tropical flowers and the smoky, salty galbanum-ambergris tandem is what makes Fleur de Lalita such a tour de force. The innocent side of Fleur de Lalita shows its face first, with a cluster of jasmine, magnolia, and lily so wet and crisp it might have been cut from the garden just moments before. Curlicues of buttery ylang ylang snake around the white petals as you bury your face in this bouquet, releasing a steamy tropical undercurrent. But the damp lushness of the flowers is almost immediately cut by a waft of galbanum, a green resin whose smell is pitched halfway between freshly-cut plant stems and smoke. The effect is of being in a tropical garden while someone is smoking an illicit cigarette in a nearby ylang bush, the smoke mingling gently with the creamy flowers. A dash of resinous sandalwood gives the florals and greenery a handsome backbone. But the real payoff comes in the base, when musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris to form a sweet and salty skin-like nuance that will send you over the top. The combination of creamy florals, crisp greenery, smoke, and salty musks in Fleur de Lalita is simply stunning. This is the fragrance that will make you feel like the best version of yourself, every day of your life.","rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang-ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fleur de lalita bouquet tropical flowers grown moved france taken smoking reading baudelaire peel back layers see core lush ylang ylang tropical lilies magnolia remains intact bookended smoky galbanum top salty lived ambergris fleur de lalita definitely floral adults playoff milky sweetness tropical flowers smoky salty galbanum ambergris tandem makes fleur de lalita tour de force innocent side fleur de lalita shows face first cluster jasmine magnolia lily wet crisp might cut garden moments curlicues buttery ylang ylang snake around white petals bury face bouquet releasing steamy tropical undercurrent damp lushness flowers almost immediately cut waft galbanum green resin whose smell pitched halfway freshly cut plant stems smoke effect tropical garden someone smoking illicit cigarette nearby ylang bush smoke mingling gently creamy flowers dash resinous sandalwood gives florals greenery handsome backbone real payoff comes base musky ambrette wraps around natural ambergris form sweet salty skin like nuance send top combination creamy florals crisp greenery smoke salty musks fleur de lalita simply stunning fragrance make feel like best version every day life,"rose de mai, magnolia, jasmine, white lily, galbanum, ylang-ylang, ambrette, vanilla, sandalwood, tonka bean, ambergris"
Moscow Mule Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"Crisp, potent and energizing- a Moscow Mule, that electric combination of premium vodka, fresh lime, and fiery ginger beer, served in an ice-cold copper mug, might just be the perfect summer refreshment. It's only appropriate that this simple, perfect formula is the inspiration for the latest from Romano Ricci and Juliette Has A Gun, a house that's always excelled at finding the complexity in minimalism.

Fantastic Oud Eau de Parfum,Montale,"What is the true identity of oud? While the ingredient can have many characteristics- sharp, rich, warm, medicinal, pungent, spicy- it's true nature transcends specific notes and becomes something more alluringly abstract- a sense of mystery, exoticism, romance and supernatural presence. This is at the core of Fantastic Oud, in many ways a culmination of Montale's illustrious work with the material, a sumptuous feast for the senses. This rich, nuanced and warm fragrance reveals notes of rose, patchouli, tobacco, incense and styrax that merge with the voluptuous notes of leather, sandalwood and ambergris revealing the rawest character of oud. In other words, it's every facet of oud, masterfully blended together to offer something for everyone in a hypnotically smooth, spicy, rich, warm, fresh, lush, seductive package.

Orris Tattoo Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Orris Tattoo pays tribute to one of perfumery's most incredible raw materials â orris root. While florists adore the delicate, arching flowers and tall green stems of the iris, perfumers are far more interested in the unprepossessing-looking root underneath. The process of making orris butter is a real labor of love. The iris roots, or rhizomes as they are known, are left to grow underground for three years, and then left to dry out in a cool storeroom for another three years. The result is the most expensive butter you will never find on any supermarket shelf â a silvery substance that Chandler Burr once referred to as 'liquid good taste'. Like pure orris butter itself, Orris Tattoo smells like the ground and the sky all bound together in one smell. To wit, it smells like bread, violets, eau de vie, suede shoes, cold air, and silky earth. Rooty and somewhat fresh at fresh, the scent soon develops a putty-like texture that remains cool to the touch, like chilled butter taken from a florist's fridge. The orris here feels very pure, but it won't make you feel like you're chomping on raw carrots â its purity is gentle, wrapped in a cashmere blanket. This purity is sustained right through to the supple grey suede that develops in the lower registers of the scent. With a material as exquisite as orris root, we pleased to see that Orris Tattoo resists the temptation to add on too many bells and whistles â apart from a touch of what feels like humid, coconutty sandalwood, cashmere woods, and a hint of violets or heliotrope, this fragrance never really deviates from the orris root hymn sheet. So, if you're looking for the doughy but ethereal pleasures of pure orris, then put Orris Tattoo on your test list stat.",orris root,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76709.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,orris tattoo pays tribute one perfumery's incredible raw materials orris root florists adore delicate arching flowers tall green stems iris perfumers far interested unprepossessing looking root underneath process making orris butter real labor love iris roots rhizomes known left grow underground three years left dry cool storeroom another three years result expensive butter never find supermarket shelf silvery substance chandler burr referred 'liquid good taste' like pure orris butter orris tattoo smells like ground sky bound together one smell wit smells like bread violets eau de vie suede shoes cold air silky earth rooty somewhat fresh fresh scent soon develops putty like texture remains cool touch like chilled butter taken florist's fridge orris feels pure make feel like chomping raw carrots purity gentle wrapped cashmere blanket purity sustained right supple grey suede develops lower registers scent material exquisite orris root pleased see orris tattoo resists temptation add many bells whistles apart touch feels like humid coconutty sandalwood cashmere woods hint violets heliotrope fragrance never really deviates orris root hymn sheet looking doughy ethereal pleasures pure orris put orris tattoo test list stat,orris root
Chypre Mojo Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"In 1917, there was a new shape in the air when Coty launched its now legendary Chypre de Coty. Putting forth the idea that a perfume could smell as indefinably complex as the person who wore it, this landmark scent swept away the cobwebs of the simpler floral perfumery of the previous century. In the century that followed, the chypre idea proved to be an enduring one, its seemingly endless permutations of bergamot, labdanum, and oakmoss giving rise to some of the most meaningful perfumes in the world, like Mitsouko, Tabac Blond, and Pour Monsieur. Of course, time stops for no man (and no chypre). In this post-IFRA age, and 100 years on from the launch of Chypre de Coty, Parle-Moi de Parfum suggests that Chypre Mojo is what a chypre now looks like. Despite the absence of oakmoss, Chypre Mojo rolls in with all the presence of a properâÂold skool' perfume. Its combination of carnation and patchouli conjures up a phantasmagoric impression of a massive rose-patch chypre that's been soaked in plum wine and dusted with black pepper. A bright, pulpy heart of mango takes the stiff bones of the chypre and ages it backwards until it feels more legible for a younger audience. Chypre Mojo never feels less than a chypre, though. While the fruit keeps those feel-good endorphins flowing, the peppery carnation and patchouli duo adds that touch of vermouth dryness that says chypre as clear as a bell. Confident, modern, and ebullient, Chypre Mojo makes us think that, 100 years on, the chypre still has its mojo.","bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,new shape air coty launched legendary chypre de coty putting forth idea perfume could smell indefinably complex person wore landmark scent swept away cobwebs simpler floral perfumery previous century century followed chypre idea proved enduring one seemingly endless permutations bergamot labdanum oakmoss giving rise meaningful perfumes world like mitsouko tabac blond pour monsieur course time stops man chypre post ifra age years launch chypre de coty parle moi de parfum suggests chypre mojo chypre looks like despite absence oakmoss chypre mojo rolls presence proper old skool' perfume combination carnation patchouli conjures phantasmagoric impression massive rose patch chypre that's soaked plum wine dusted black pepper bright pulpy heart mango takes stiff bones chypre ages backwards feels legible younger audience chypre mojo never feels less chypre though fruit keeps feel good endorphins flowing peppery carnation patchouli duo adds touch vermouth dryness says chypre clear bell confident modern ebullient chypre mojo makes us think years chypre still mojo,"bergamot, carnation, mango, patchouli"
Heritage Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"Many fragrances offer you a journey to a faraway destination, but Heritage is a journey back in time, to an era when European high society was bold, beautiful and sumptuously opulent- and the fragrances were every bit up to that standard. Truly a haute couture scent, Heritage is an elegant, alluring potion that evokes grand ballrooms and ornate theaters- a true taste of the kind of luxury that too often has been sadly confined to a bygone age. Heritage opens with vintage panache, featuring fresh, invigorating notes of juicy bergamot and a bright twinkle of sparkling, ethereal aldehydes. A complex, yet approachable, heart of sweet jasmine and powdery orris is elevated with a touch of mystical frankincense, while in the rich, dignified base, a warm blend of woods, creamy vanilla, and superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth. Taken as a whole, this is the kind of opulence that prefers to pamper rather than overwhelm- it's genuinely comforting, conferring an almost hypnotic sense of well-being on the wearer. Sure, we'll never get to live in Paris as it was in the Belle Epoque, but with Heritage, we can visit- and what a glamorous visit it will be.","bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure vintage oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,many fragrances offer journey faraway destination heritage journey back time era european high society bold beautiful sumptuously opulent fragrances every bit standard truly haute couture scent heritage elegant alluring potion evokes grand ballrooms ornate theaters true taste kind luxury often sadly confined bygone age heritage opens vintage panache featuring fresh invigorating notes juicy bergamot bright twinkle sparkling ethereal aldehydes complex yet approachable heart sweet jasmine powdery orris elevated touch mystical frankincense rich dignified base warm blend woods creamy vanilla superlative natural oud provide remarkable depth taken whole kind opulence prefers pamper rather overwhelm genuinely comforting conferring almost hypnotic sense well wearer sure we'll never get live paris belle epoque heritage visit glamorous visit,"bergamot, aldehydes, jasmine, orris, frankincense, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, pure vintage oud"
Vanille Benjoin Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"Upon application, Vanille Benjoin immediately envelops its wearer in a soft, protective cocoon of vanilla that we find insanely comforting. It's a hug in a bottle. The perfumer, an island native herself, helped the brand to source two types of very special vanilla for this scent â the first, a soft, floral Tahitian vanilla, and the second, a resinous Madagascaran vanilla. The vanillas add a toasty warmth to the scent, as well as a delicious 'roundness', but it's worth noting that there's nothing sugary or heavy about Vanille Benjoin. The vanilla here is dry and woody, tending towards the savory end of the spectrum rather than the sweet.
The salty diffusiveness of ambroxan certainly helps to control sweetness, but the main hand in ensuring the scent remains dry is the Siam benzoin, the basenote material chosen here to be 'married' to the vanilla. Although benzoin is roughly analogous to vanilla in that they both add a warm, sweet 'fullness' to the basenotes of a scent, benzoin differs substantially by being far more medicinal, resinous, and spicy-peppery in character. In Vanille Benjoin, the fiery cinnamon topnotes of benzoin are cleverly matched, step for step, by cedarwood, a material possessed of a similarly spicy, balsamic underbite. In an equally smart move, the doughy, clay-like properties of benzoin are drawn out by a judicious application of tonka bean absolute, which shares with benzoin a buttery texture and nutty aftertaste. Vanille Benjoin resolves itself in a delicious vanilla suede accord that signals pure luxury and comfort, without any of attendant stodge - powdered sugar diffused in the crisp, cold air of a winter's morning.","vanilla absolute, benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,upon application vanille benjoin immediately envelops wearer soft protective cocoon vanilla find insanely comforting hug bottle perfumer island native helped brand source two types special vanilla scent first soft floral tahitian vanilla second resinous madagascaran vanilla vanillas add toasty warmth scent well delicious 'roundness' worth noting there's nothing sugary heavy vanille benjoin vanilla dry woody tending towards savory end spectrum rather sweet salty diffusiveness ambroxan certainly helps control sweetness main hand ensuring scent remains dry siam benzoin basenote material chosen 'married' vanilla although benzoin roughly analogous vanilla add warm sweet 'fullness' basenotes scent benzoin differs substantially far medicinal resinous spicy peppery character vanille benjoin fiery cinnamon topnotes benzoin cleverly matched step step cedarwood material possessed similarly spicy balsamic underbite equally smart move doughy clay like properties benzoin drawn judicious application tonka bean absolute shares benzoin buttery texture nutty aftertaste vanille benjoin resolves delicious vanilla suede accord signals pure luxury comfort without attendant stodge powdered sugar diffused crisp cold air winter's morning,"vanilla absolute, benzoin, tonka, ambroxan, cedar"
Santal Basmati Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"The deeply fragrant aroma of Basmati rice is one of the best smells in the world, and frankly, we're a little surprised it doesn't turn up in more perfumes. In Santal Basmati, perfumer Alexandra Carlin, taking her cue from founder Sophie Broneau's passion for basenotes, cleverly pairs the scent of cooked rice to the most precious and fragrant of woods: Mysore sandalwood (s. album), grown sustainably in Kerala. Why clever? Well, you'll notice that basmati rice has a lot in common with sandalwood â they share a certain creaminess, as well as a steamy, nutty undertone akin to grains toasted in butter and cooked long and slow in milk. Santal Basmati simply identifies the facets they have in common, unites them, and serves us up a bowl of pure bliss. You'd be forgiven for thinking that, given all these milky, woody notes, Santal Basmati is a rather heavy concoction â but it's really not. A remarkable sleight of hand injects the composition with an airiness that ensures that, while certainly comforting and warming, the scent wears as lightly as a silk cardigan. The sweetness level is nicely judged too, with a buttered popcorn nuance adding a hint of salt, and a supporting framework of woods that stops the scent tipping over completely into rice pudding territory. If you love the triple creme comfort factor of woody gourmands such as Santal Majuscule (Serge Lutens), Palo Santo (Carner Barcelona), or Praline de Santal (Pierre Guillaume), then let us tell you straight: you need some Santal Basmati in your life.","sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,deeply fragrant aroma basmati rice one best smells world frankly we're little surprised turn perfumes santal basmati perfumer alexandra carlin taking cue founder sophie broneau's passion basenotes cleverly pairs scent cooked rice precious fragrant woods mysore sandalwood album grown sustainably kerala clever well notice basmati rice lot common sandalwood share certain creaminess well steamy nutty undertone akin grains toasted butter cooked long slow milk santal basmati simply identifies facets common unites serves us bowl pure bliss forgiven thinking given milky woody notes santal basmati rather heavy concoction really remarkable sleight hand injects composition airiness ensures certainly comforting warming scent wears lightly silk cardigan sweetness level nicely judged buttered popcorn nuance adding hint salt supporting framework woods stops scent tipping completely rice pudding territory love triple creme comfort factor woody gourmands santal majuscule serge lutens palo santo carner barcelona praline de santal pierre guillaume let us tell straight need santal basmati life,"sandalwood, basmati rice, patchouli, iris, cashmeran"
Cedre Iris Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"Cedre Iris is that rare bird â a 100% equal partnership between delicate iris pallida and a material that would normally eat it for breakfast, namely a tough, resinous cedarwood. Well, three types of cedarwood, to be exact, the combination of which gives the composition a complex woody profile that darts between smoky, leathery, balsamic, and spicy. But in Cedre Iris, the tension between the heavy cedarwood and the ephemeral orris is held tight, allowing the cool, waxen orris to float serenely over the very material that would normally subsume it. The payoff of this impressive balancing act is a fragrance that highlights both the exquisitely powdery sheen of iris and the spicy thickness of cedar. Iris pallida from Florence, which costs $60,000 per kilo, has been used in significant quantities here, so you really feel its presence. But Iris Cedre is not a monolith. The iris and cedarwood star, for sure, but in time, you will notice that they are supported by elements that cast their own shadows. Particularly noticeable is the cinnamon-dusted benzoin that sands down the cedar and orris into a soft blur of incensey, vanillic powder, for dramatic scent trail that's sure to turn heads. But myrrh also plays a significant role here, lending the drydown in particular a crepuscular, almost fungal earthiness that serves to highlight the pale dustiness of the iris. Wax, butter, silver, earth, incense, and polished woods â Iris Cedre truly is the last word in tailored elegance.","cedar, iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cedre iris rare bird equal partnership delicate iris pallida material would normally eat breakfast namely tough resinous cedarwood well three types cedarwood exact combination gives composition complex woody profile darts smoky leathery balsamic spicy cedre iris tension heavy cedarwood ephemeral orris held tight allowing cool waxen orris float serenely material would normally subsume payoff impressive balancing act fragrance highlights exquisitely powdery sheen iris spicy thickness cedar iris pallida florence costs per kilo used significant quantities really feel presence iris cedre monolith iris cedarwood star sure time notice supported elements cast shadows particularly noticeable cinnamon dusted benzoin sands cedar orris soft blur incensey vanillic powder dramatic scent trail that's sure turn heads myrrh also plays significant role lending drydown particular crepuscular almost fungal earthiness serves highlight pale dustiness iris wax butter silver earth incense polished woods iris cedre truly last word tailored elegance,"cedar, iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac"
Patchouli Oud Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"Tom Waits' voice was once memorably described by a music critic as sounding as if ""it was soaked in a vat of bourbon, left hanging in the smokehouse for a few months, and then taken outside and run over with a car"" â and Patchouli Oud by perfumer Nicolas Bonneville has much the same quality. Earthy, tannic, and soaked in mysterious essences wrenched from trees in the depths of Indonesian and Javan jungles, Patchouli Oud is a study in brown. Many oud-based fragrances smell pungent and oily, but Patchouli Oud plumps for a dry, almost herbal take on its subject matter, for a result that runs surprisingly close to the clipped elegance of vintage powerhouse masculines. The oud, medicinal and slightly dirty, is first out of the gate, quickly followed by a dusty 100% cocoa patchouli that seems to invert all light, drawing us deeper into its shadows. As with any scent based entirely on heavy basenotes, there's always the danger of it turning into a lead balloon, but that's been avoided here thanks to use of a bright, grassy vetiver and the lemony smoke of elemi resin, both of which keep the composition aerated. The smoky chypric finish of whiskey-ish labdanum and bitter oakmoss confirms Patchouli Oud as the perfect choice for the gentleman daring enough to pull off an oud scent alongside a perfectly tailored three-piece suit.","oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tom waits' voice memorably described music critic sounding soaked vat bourbon left hanging smokehouse months taken outside run car patchouli oud perfumer nicolas bonneville much quality earthy tannic soaked mysterious essences wrenched trees depths indonesian javan jungles patchouli oud study brown many oud based fragrances smell pungent oily patchouli oud plumps dry almost herbal take subject matter result runs surprisingly close clipped elegance vintage powerhouse masculines oud medicinal slightly dirty first gate quickly followed dusty cocoa patchouli seems invert light drawing us deeper shadows scent based entirely heavy basenotes there's always danger turning lead balloon that's avoided thanks use bright grassy vetiver lemony smoke elemi resin keep composition aerated smoky chypric finish whiskey ish labdanum bitter oakmoss confirms patchouli oud perfect choice gentleman daring enough pull oud scent alongside perfectly tailored three piece suit,"oud, patchouli, vetiver, cistus, elemi, incense, gaiac, tree moss"
Musc Ambre Gris Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"Ambergris, the precious sperm whale excretion that's aged for years by the ocean, is the purest essence of the sea. It's an unusual material in perfumery because although it derives from an animal and retains a distinctly animalic character, it also smells mineral, earthy, ozonic, and foresty. In fact, one could say that the scent of ambergris is a microcosm of nature's bounty in full. Ambergris is something of a shapeshifter in perfumery, though â it's suggestible. In Musc Ambre Gris, the perfumer has nudged the natural ambergris towards a saltier, woodsier interpretation than some of the sweeter, more amber-focused compositions in the genre. What's striking about this fragrance is that it smells completely organic, as if it were ripped from nature and not made in a lab. It encompasses all the wind-chafed aromas of a desolate beach in winter, ranging from desiccated driftwood, crushed seashells, and minerals to the inky bitterness of marine lichen. Musc Ambre Gris smells vivid and wild, its smoky tangle of sea grasses (vetiver), yerba mate, and sharp black musk with its creosote-like tang all pulling together to emphasize the raspy, masculine-leaning character of the scent. In the far drydown, earthy patchouli and white truffle add a fungal depth that accentuates the salt-flat brininess of the ambergris. A perfume of scorched earth, Musc Ambre Gris has the brooding intensity of a young Brando- not to mention the undeniable seductiveness.","amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambergris precious sperm whale excretion that's aged years ocean purest essence sea unusual material perfumery although derives animal retains distinctly animalic character also smells mineral earthy ozonic foresty fact one could say scent ambergris microcosm nature's bounty full ambergris something shapeshifter perfumery though suggestible musc ambre gris perfumer nudged natural ambergris towards saltier woodsier interpretation sweeter amber focused compositions genre what's striking fragrance smells completely organic ripped nature made lab encompasses wind chafed aromas desolate beach winter ranging desiccated driftwood crushed seashells minerals inky bitterness marine lichen musc ambre gris smells vivid wild smoky tangle sea grasses vetiver yerba mate sharp black musk creosote like tang pulling together emphasize raspy masculine leaning character scent far drydown earthy patchouli white truffle add fungal depth accentuates salt flat brininess ambergris perfume scorched earth musc ambre gris brooding intensity young brando mention undeniable seductiveness,"amber gris, black musk, white truffle, yerba mate, patchouli, vetiver"
Cuir Curcuma Eau de Parfum,Affinessence Paris,"The first fragrance in the world to use natural extract of turmeric, Cuir Curcuma is a strikingly different kind of leather fragrance. Neither a Russian nor a Spanish (Moorish) leather, but rather, an Indian leather, it rises like a phoenix from the clay attar stills and tanning yards of Kannauj, where ancient ayurvedic principles of balance in all things still reigns supreme. Cuir Curcuma is fine leather cured with lots of earthy golden spice and hot milk, for a result that's unusual enough to be distinctive but delicious enough to be comforting. Cuir Curcuma cleverly plays on the theme of a traditional Indian drink called Golden Milk, an ayurvedic tonic taken in India to cleanse the bloodstream and balance all doshas. This golden elixir balances the iodic bitterness of turmeric with the sweet creaminess of whole milk, pulverized almonds, sugar, and pistachios. You'll find that the same push-pull between 'eat me' and 'don't eat me' carried through to the fragrance itself. The crazy-delicious lactones thrown off by the sandalwood create a 'steamed milk' effect similar to the one in Santal Basmati, but here it is spicier - woods cooked down with resin until the bottom layer catches and caramelizes. It smells incredibly tasty, but also tasteful, a sprinkle of salty, anisic myrrh stopping the scent from straying too far into gourmandise. Cuir Curcuma is a scent full of drama, its inky medicinal notes making you sit up and take notice. Sweepingly exotic, yet seductively cozy, this is the leather jacket you never thought you could pull off, and now can't live without.","turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/796005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first fragrance world use natural extract turmeric cuir curcuma strikingly different kind leather fragrance neither russian spanish moorish leather rather indian leather rises like phoenix clay attar stills tanning yards kannauj ancient ayurvedic principles balance things still reigns supreme cuir curcuma fine leather cured lots earthy golden spice hot milk result that's unusual enough distinctive delicious enough comforting cuir curcuma cleverly plays theme traditional indian drink called golden milk ayurvedic tonic taken india cleanse bloodstream balance doshas golden elixir balances iodic bitterness turmeric sweet creaminess whole milk pulverized almonds sugar pistachios find push pull 'eat me' 'don't eat me' carried fragrance crazy delicious lactones thrown sandalwood create 'steamed milk' effect similar one santal basmati spicier woods cooked resin bottom layer catches caramelizes smells incredibly tasty also tasteful sprinkle salty anisic myrrh stopping scent straying far gourmandise cuir curcuma scent full drama inky medicinal notes making sit take notice sweepingly exotic yet seductively cozy leather jacket never thought could pull can't live without,"turmeric, myrrh, sandalwood, patchouli, leather"
Hwyl Eau de Parfum,Aesop,"Smoky, woodsy, completely compelling, Hwyl is an explorer's journey into the heart of the eternal forest as only Aesop could present it. Combining gorgeously smooth cedarwood and seductively sexy incense- lovers of CDG Hinoki and Incense Kyoto should clear a spot on the shelf right now- Hwyl adds an intriguing element of depth with an intense base of vetiver that showcases grassy and spicy facets with equal aplomb.

Tempo Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"All too often, patchouli scents seem to be apologizing for their star ingredient. ""It's patchouli,"" the refrain goes, ""but it's not hippie patchouli."" Tempo, the wonderful new patchouli scent from Diptyque, defies such simple-minded rejection- after all, it's explicitly inspired by 60's counterculture- but those fearing unbearably thick earthiness and lack of nuance will surely be delighted by Tempo's complex, gorgeous subtlety, which weds three distinct types of patchouli to a perfectly balanced mix of mate and violet, delivering a scent both unapologetically patchouli-driven, yet undeniably sophisticated.
By building around a carefully calibrated mix of three sustainably-sourced, ethically-harvested varieties of Indonesian patchouli, Olivier Pescheux delivers a patchouli accord that celebrates all facets of the material: earthy, woodsy, spicy and sweet, all balanced against one another with subtle elegance. This careful balance is further enhanced with lively, green violet leaf and nutty, spicy mate, which serve to remove even the tiniest edges from the scent- the patchouli washes over you so gently that it's hard to even remember why it would ever be considered a divisive ingredient. Even if you long ago traded in your bell bottoms for designer jeans, give Tempo a chance- you may never think of patchouli the same way again.","bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483030.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,often patchouli scents seem apologizing star ingredient patchouli refrain goes hippie patchouli tempo wonderful new patchouli scent diptyque defies simple minded rejection explicitly inspired 's counterculture fearing unbearably thick earthiness lack nuance surely delighted tempo's complex gorgeous subtlety weds three distinct types patchouli perfectly balanced mix mate violet delivering scent unapologetically patchouli driven yet undeniably sophisticated building around carefully calibrated mix three sustainably sourced ethically harvested varieties indonesian patchouli olivier pescheux delivers patchouli accord celebrates facets material earthy woodsy spicy sweet balanced one another subtle elegance careful balance enhanced lively green violet leaf nutty spicy mate serve remove even tiniest edges scent patchouli washes gently hard even remember would ever considered divisive ingredient even long ago traded bell bottoms designer jeans give tempo chance may never think patchouli way,"bergamot, pink pepper, patchouli, mate, clary sage, violet leaf"
Fleur de Peau Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"As part of Diptyque's 50th anniversary celebration, Fleur de Peau is meant to turn back the clock to the 1960's, and one of the counterculture's most beloved scents- musk. Warm, sweet, and deeply sensual, the musk oils of the 60's were more powerful than subtle, so how then to update that classic feeling for today's grown-up, yet nostalgic, audience? By wedding a gorgeous bouquet of various musks to a beautiful, iris-driven floral heart, Fleur de Peau has us in awe of its sophisticated, subtle, musky perfection.
The musks at the core of Fleur de Peau are, simply put, heavenly- a divine combination of notes both cotton-soft and rich, light and soapy-given an extra element of sparkle with a perfect amount of aldehydes. A beautiful iris note- a bit powder, a bit paper, a touch of woodsy earth, but primarily clean- blends with fruity, gently ambery ambrette seed, and ambergris further extends a rich, mineralic tone that deepens the musks without displacing them. All together, it creates a skin scent with every bit as much complexity as a towering oriental, the kind of fragrance that will bring you back to your wrist countless times over the scent's impressive lifespan. It's a trip both forwards and backwards in time, a scent that celebrates the past with the sophistication of the future- and really, what could be more perfect for Diptyque's 50th anniversary? Musk lovers- your perfect skin scent has arrived.","aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483031.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,part diptyque's th anniversary celebration fleur de peau meant turn back clock 's one counterculture's beloved scents musk warm sweet deeply sensual musk oils 's powerful subtle update classic feeling today's grown yet nostalgic audience wedding gorgeous bouquet various musks beautiful iris driven floral heart fleur de peau us awe sophisticated subtle musky perfection musks core fleur de peau simply put heavenly divine combination notes cotton soft rich light soapy given extra element sparkle perfect amount aldehydes beautiful iris note bit powder bit paper touch woodsy earth primarily clean blends fruity gently ambery ambrette seed ambergris extends rich mineralic tone deepens musks without displacing together creates skin scent every bit much complexity towering oriental kind fragrance bring back wrist countless times scent's impressive lifespan trip forwards backwards time scent celebrates past sophistication future really could perfect diptyque's th anniversary musk lovers perfect skin scent arrived,"aldehydes, pink pepper, rose, iris, ambrette, ambergris, musk"
Lost In Flowers Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC,"If you've ever tried out a bunch of floral perfumes and said to yourself, nope, just not floral enough, then let us introduce you to Lost in Flowers. Remember the scene from American Beauty when the cheerleader lying in the bath was showered with rose petals? Well, replace the roses with champaca, muguet, and gardenia petals, and that's what wearing Lost in Flowers feels like. Most aptly named, Lost in Flowers is a sublime experience akin to submerging oneself in a warm bath of heady, fragrant, life-giving flowers. Called joy oil in India, the rare red champaca otto used in Lost in Flowers casts a strange, unearthly glow over the composition. It at first smells innocent, like fruit dipped in cream and wrapped in a clean, juicy shampoo aura. But then it is also smells musky and honeyed, in a way that's more suggestive of intimacy. What dominates, for us, however, is the exquisite gardenia enfleurage, a costly and rare extraction that yields the only true portrait of gardenia that exists in perfumery. Gardenia lovers take note â this is Holy Grail material: creamy, salty, and with a bodacious meatiness that's soulful without ever tripping over into bleu cheese territory. The astringent pop of saffron adds an undertone of leather and iodine, the tagetes a pungent, hay-like facet â colorful touches of Indian attar perfumery in an otherwise tropical picture. Thanks to these spicy, woody touches, and to the salinity of the gardenia, Lost in Flowers never runs sweet or syrupy. It's not even overtly feminine in the traditional sense. In other words, men â knock yourselves out with this one. It's a stunner, no matter which way you slice it.","red champaca oil, lily of the valley, marigold, saffron, gardenia enfleurage, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ever tried bunch floral perfumes said nope floral enough let us introduce lost flowers remember scene american beauty cheerleader lying bath showered rose petals well replace roses champaca muguet gardenia petals that's wearing lost flowers feels like aptly named lost flowers sublime experience akin submerging oneself warm bath heady fragrant life giving flowers called joy oil india rare red champaca otto used lost flowers casts strange unearthly glow composition first smells innocent like fruit dipped cream wrapped clean juicy shampoo aura also smells musky honeyed way that's suggestive intimacy dominates us however exquisite gardenia enfleurage costly rare extraction yields true portrait gardenia exists perfumery gardenia lovers take note holy grail material creamy salty bodacious meatiness that's soulful without ever tripping bleu cheese territory astringent pop saffron adds undertone leather iodine tagetes pungent hay like facet colorful touches indian attar perfumery otherwise tropical picture thanks spicy woody touches salinity gardenia lost flowers never runs sweet syrupy even overtly feminine traditional sense words men knock one stunner matter way slice,"red champaca oil, lily valley, marigold, saffron, gardenia enfleurage, oud"

Dead of Night Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC,"Dead of Night is an oil-based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled from agarwood trees grown on a sustainably-managed 600-acre plantation in Borneo. It's the equivalent of the Slow Food movement, only in oud terms â no chemical inoculation, no rubbery oud aromachemicals, and little interference from humans. This slow way of farming agarwood produces oud oil that is authentically pungent at first, but quickly softens to reveal the supple, tangy aroma of lambskin freshly cured with hay, herbs, and tea. Polished and set in the frame of a fragrance composition like a jewel, a material like this oud shines. Just keep in mind that this is indeed real oud. Those with little to no experience of oud outside of commercial perfumery might be taken aback at how animalistic and raw the note appears at first, but fear not! In time, the fearsome braggadocio of the opening relaxes into a wonderful aroma of soft leather, delicately sour with accents of dried apricots and fermented tea. Violet leaf and bergamot add freshness to the composition, the crushed greenery and citrus notes mimicking the minty sparkle of agarwood grown on the island of Borneo. The florals are subtly placed so as not to distract from the golden, glowing oud, but a glimpse of rose and jasmine emerges in the heart to sweeten its hay-like tone. Subtle brushstrokes of sandalwood and incense help the oud to fade out gently at the end, but, like a theater star, it lingers for hours on stage, in full knowledge that it's what people really came to see.","bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dead night oil based fragrance featuring organic oud oil distilled agarwood trees grown sustainably managed acre plantation borneo equivalent slow food movement oud terms chemical inoculation rubbery oud aromachemicals little interference humans slow way farming agarwood produces oud oil authentically pungent first quickly softens reveal supple tangy aroma lambskin freshly cured hay herbs tea polished set frame fragrance composition like jewel material like oud shines keep mind indeed real oud little experience oud outside commercial perfumery might taken aback animalistic raw note appears first fear time fearsome braggadocio opening relaxes wonderful aroma soft leather delicately sour accents dried apricots fermented tea violet leaf bergamot add freshness composition crushed greenery citrus notes mimicking minty sparkle agarwood grown island borneo florals subtly placed distract golden glowing oud glimpse rose jasmine emerges heart sweeten hay like tone subtle brushstrokes sandalwood incense help oud fade gently end like theater star lingers hours stage full knowledge people really came see,"bergamot, violet leaf, jasmine, rose, amber, sandalwood, incense, oud"

Silence the Sea Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC,"Silence the Sea is the true essence of the sea. Forget the horrors of Calone and sweet aquatics â this scent captures all the stony, mineral silence of a deserted beach in winter. Because it is a brand deeply invested in organic, sustainable raw material production, Strangelove NYC was able to source an ethically-harvested (beach cast) piece of ambergris and use it as the star in this composition. And indeed, it is the strange, salty-sweet airiness of ambergris that dominates here. It floats at the center, emanating an aura of fresh marine air, earth, dried newspapers, tobacco, and even the warm funk of a freshly-cleaned horse stable. Ambergris is, in short, the salty, yeasty smell of a child's head after hours of playing on a cold beach. Cleverly, the perfumer has chosen to not overshadow the ambergris but simply flank its already-complex smell with a host of complimentary 'flavors', such as the minty bitterness of angelica, the earthy funk of truffle, and the vegetal, rubbery texture of tuberose. These notes play a valiant second fiddle to the ambergris, emphasizing its flinty, mineral sweetness and extending its unearthly radiance in all directions. Those who love the mysterious, almost indefinable smell of the salt air on a cold beach will adore Silence the Sea.","ambergris, oud, tuber, jasmine, tuberose, angelica",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,silence sea true essence sea forget horrors calone sweet aquatics scent captures stony mineral silence deserted beach winter brand deeply invested organic sustainable raw material production strangelove nyc able source ethically harvested beach cast piece ambergris use star composition indeed strange salty sweet airiness ambergris dominates floats center emanating aura fresh marine air earth dried newspapers tobacco even warm funk freshly cleaned horse stable ambergris short salty yeasty smell child's head hours playing cold beach cleverly perfumer chosen overshadow ambergris simply flank already complex smell host complimentary 'flavors' minty bitterness angelica earthy funk truffle vegetal rubbery texture tuberose notes play valiant second fiddle ambergris emphasizing flinty mineral sweetness extending unearthly radiance directions love mysterious almost indefinable smell salt air cold beach adore silence sea,"ambergris, oud, tuber, jasmine, tuberose, angelica"

Melt my Heart Eau de Parfum,Strangelove NYC,"A gourmand lover's dream, but really so much more than just a delicious smell, Melt My Heart is an oil-based fragrance that captures the dizzying sensation of falling in love. And if you imagine that to feel like falling slowly backwards into a featherbed filled with fluffy orris butter and dark chocolate, well, then your vision lines right up with that of Strangelove NYC. Creamy, soft, and utterly addictive, this scent combines the mouthfeel of powdered white chocolate and lipstick with the velvety bitterness of 85% cocoa. Real orris butter, costlier than most other perfumery materials and described by Chandler Burr as 'liquid good taste', has been used generously here to give the more edible elements spaciousness and lift, like a puff of silvery breath on the cold air. It is the 'white' element that contrasts so effectively with the dulcet bitterness of the dark chocolate note. Real oud, ginger, and mandarin are just present enough to draw out various facets of the chocolate and the iris â a spicy, woodsy undertone perhaps - but don't expect too dominant a presence. The sandalwood, in comparison, is a real MVP in this composition, its lush, buttered, coconutty sweetness playing off the dark chocolate and orris to create a delicious Mounds Bar accord that will make you want to nibble your arm. The perfumer, Christophe Laudamiel, says that Melt My Heart is 'for falling in love.' Well, we can't imagine anyone smelling this and not being helplessly in its thrall.","ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/79306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gourmand lover's dream really much delicious smell melt heart oil based fragrance captures dizzying sensation falling love imagine feel like falling slowly backwards featherbed filled fluffy orris butter dark chocolate well vision lines right strangelove nyc creamy soft utterly addictive scent combines mouthfeel powdered white chocolate lipstick velvety bitterness cocoa real orris butter costlier perfumery materials described chandler burr 'liquid good taste' used generously give edible elements spaciousness lift like puff silvery breath cold air 'white' element contrasts effectively dulcet bitterness dark chocolate note real oud ginger mandarin present enough draw various facets chocolate iris spicy woodsy undertone perhaps expect dominant presence sandalwood comparison real mvp composition lush buttered coconutty sweetness playing dark chocolate orris create delicious mounds bar accord make want nibble arm perfumer christophe laudamiel says melt heart 'for falling love ' well can't imagine anyone smelling helplessly thrall,"ginger, bergamot, nutmeg, sage, oud, dark chocolate, orris root"

Be Careful What You Wish For Parfum Extrait,4160 Tuesdays,"An oud scent from 4160 Tuesdays? We didn't think it would ever happen, mostly because Sarah herself said it probably wouldn't. After all, with so many companies shoving one oud after another out to market, doing an oud just to do it wouldn't really seem to be on-brand for a perfumer who is forging a wonderful career out of following her own inspirations. But a fateful trip to Dubai left Sarah with some truly exquisite specimens of agarwood extract and, for the first time, she felt the call. So, how to make an oud scent that's also, first and foremost, a 4160 Tuesdays scent? One sniff and the answer is clear. Be Careful What You Wish for is by far the juiciest, fruitiest, most delectably fresh oud we've ever smelled. Energized with tantalizingly tart citrus and shot through with sweet peach, this scent still manages to be as deep, woody and captivating as you could hope for. Five types of real oud will do that, but the balance against the fruit strikes a joyous major chord, while the typical funk of decaying wood is replaced with a grand richness that lasts for untold hours. As tongue-in-cheek as the name may be, if you were wishing for an oud scent that breaks free of convention and exudes real, authentic happiness, 4160 Tuesdays is here to deliver.","pink grapefruit, juniper berry, peach, white oud, raspberry, strawberry, gaiac, patchouli, vanilla, plum, dark oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oud scent tuesdays think would ever happen mostly sarah said probably many companies shoving one oud another market oud really seem brand perfumer forging wonderful career following inspirations fateful trip dubai left sarah truly exquisite specimens agarwood extract first time felt call make oud scent that's also first foremost tuesdays scent one sniff answer clear careful wish far juiciest fruitiest delectably fresh oud we've ever smelled energized tantalizingly tart citrus shot sweet peach scent still manages deep woody captivating could hope five types real oud balance fruit strikes joyous major chord typical funk decaying wood replaced grand richness lasts untold hours tongue cheek name may wishing oud scent breaks free convention exudes real authentic happiness tuesdays deliver,"pink grapefruit, juniper berry, peach, white oud, raspberry, strawberry, gaiac, patchouli, vanilla, plum, dark oud"
Carlisle Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"Christened from a majestic 17th-century English steed, Carlisle is a warmly spiced, gourmand-inflected oriental reserved only for the bold. Opening with a colorful burst of juicy, tart green apple spiked with fiery saffron and earthy nutmeg, Carlisle immediately sets itself apart from even Marly's other wondrous gourmands with a grounded, sophisticated earthiness evident from the very first sniff- this is less indulgent dessert pudding and more the aromas of a grand ballroom soiree in full swing, mouthwatering treats mingled with well-groomed aristocracy, elaborate decor and the general spirit of revelry. A richer-yet heart reveals warm, smooth tonka bean and creamy osmanthus- but also gently bitter davana and luscious rose, leading into a true patchouli note that doesn't hold back on the earthiness. However, lovers of Herod and Oajan need not worry, either- alongside that earthy patchouli, a warmly emergent vein of creamy vanilla and sweet opoponax resinoid are every bit as enchantingly seductive as they are in Marly's other masterpieces. As they all reach an enduring harmony in Carlisle's final stages, the glow is enough to make you feel like you, yourself are descended from royalty.","green apple, saffron, nutmeg, tonka bean, osmanthus, davana, rose, patchouli, vanilla, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70026.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,christened majestic th century english steed carlisle warmly spiced gourmand inflected oriental reserved bold opening colorful burst juicy tart green apple spiked fiery saffron earthy nutmeg carlisle immediately sets apart even marly's wondrous gourmands grounded sophisticated earthiness evident first sniff less indulgent dessert pudding aromas grand ballroom soiree full swing mouthwatering treats mingled well groomed aristocracy elaborate decor general spirit revelry richer yet heart reveals warm smooth tonka bean creamy osmanthus also gently bitter davana luscious rose leading true patchouli note hold back earthiness however lovers herod oajan need worry either alongside earthy patchouli warmly emergent vein creamy vanilla sweet opoponax resinoid every bit enchantingly seductive marly's masterpieces reach enduring harmony carlisle's final stages glow enough make feel like descended royalty,"green apple, saffron, nutmeg, tonka bean, osmanthus, davana, rose, patchouli, vanilla, opoponax"

Impressions de Giverny Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"Impressions de Giverny is a scentscape inspired by Monet's famous gardens at Giverny. The artist, who was as passionate about gardening as he was about art, wanted to turn his garden into a living 'en plein air' version of his paintings, and so he did. The fragrance cleverly takes its cues from the two main areas of the Giverny garden: first, the famous Japanese water garden with its bridge and water lilies that feature in Monet's NymphÃ©as series, and second, the section where thousands of small flowers were planted to achieve the same blurred-at-the-edges, impressionistic effect espoused by his painting style. In other words, Impressions de Giverny takes its inspiration from two sources: Japanese botany and abstract floral perfumery. The way these two themes intersect is beautifully handled. The scent opens with a crisp, almost sour fruity tone, with zesty yuzu and red apple creating a delicate impression of native Japanese fruits and flora. But almost immediately you can sense the rugged, unpretentious greenery of shrubs and undergrowth shifting beneath, adding an earthy undertone. Threaded through these accords is an impressionistic swirl of flowers that's difficult to pick apart, but certainly combines the watery freshness of tulips and violet leaf with the denser, more honeyed aspects of magnolia, orange blossom, and osmanthus. There's a creamy warmth in the floral bouquet that feels great on the skin, underscored by subtle brushstrokes of mango, ylang, and peach. At the same time, it's also peppery and bright, thanks to flecks of lemony coriander and fig leaf that have been daubed on here and there for contrast. Finally, unlike many modern florals, there's a solid foundation here to keep it all afloat â a salty, musky ambergris and benzoin combo that not only shores up the florals but adds a touch of civety funk to the picture. We're just blown away by how perfectly the perfumer has combined all these minute brushstrokes of fruits, flowers, and greenery to come up with something that, despite being impressionistic and abstract in form, feels utterly coherent on the skin. If you loved Confessions of a Garden Gnome but fancy something less herbaceous and more fruity-floral, then make sampling Impressions de Giverny a priority.","yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang-ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78118.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,impressions de giverny scentscape inspired monet's famous gardens giverny artist passionate gardening art wanted turn garden living 'en plein air' version paintings fragrance cleverly takes cues two main areas giverny garden first famous japanese water garden bridge water lilies feature monet's nymph series second section thousands small flowers planted achieve blurred edges impressionistic effect espoused painting style words impressions de giverny takes inspiration two sources japanese botany abstract floral perfumery way two themes intersect beautifully handled scent opens crisp almost sour fruity tone zesty yuzu red apple creating delicate impression native japanese fruits flora almost immediately sense rugged unpretentious greenery shrubs undergrowth shifting beneath adding earthy undertone threaded accords impressionistic swirl flowers that's difficult pick apart certainly combines watery freshness tulips violet leaf denser honeyed aspects magnolia orange blossom osmanthus there's creamy warmth floral bouquet feels great skin underscored subtle brushstrokes mango ylang peach time also peppery bright thanks flecks lemony coriander fig leaf daubed contrast finally unlike many modern florals there's solid foundation keep afloat salty musky ambergris benzoin combo shores florals adds touch civety funk picture we're blown away perfectly perfumer combined minute brushstrokes fruits flowers greenery come something despite impressionistic abstract form feels utterly coherent skin loved confessions garden gnome fancy something less herbaceous fruity floral make sampling impressions de giverny priority,"yuzu, bergamot, red apple, magnolia, rose, tuberose, osmanthus, orange blossom, fig leaf, coriander, tulip, neroli, mango, ylang-ylang, ambergris, benzoin, musk"

Fabulous Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Vulgar, shocking, rude, funny, tongue in cheek....no matter what you think of the name, there's no denying that it's got people talking. But in the kerfuffle over the name, has the fragrance itself been a bit overlooked? We think it might have been. The truth is that Fucking Fabulous is very good. It's an edible but fresh suede scent that borrows a bunch of bitter herbs from old school fougeres, scads of buttery tonka from the gourmand category, and wraps it all up in a musky cashmeran glow. And guess what? Totally works. Clary sage and lavender top out the scent, their clean, smoky greenness meshing seamlessly with plush orris butter to form a leather note that's both soft and aromatic. Lashings of bittersweet almond and tonka bean beneath give the scent a velvety, almost oily-resinous sweetness, like white chocolate melted down with coffee grounds. The fragrance moves between bitter and sweet, herbal and creamy, powdery and oily over the course of the wear, keeping the journey totally interesting for us. Rumor has it that Tom Ford took one whiff of this creation and exclaimed, 'This is fucking fabulous!' We're inclined to agree.

Enter Vanille Fatale, a purring, prowling, seductively fanged new vanilla scent whose initial subtleties belie the dangerously glamorous depth within. Opening with a quiet but fiery growl of saffron and coriander, Vanille Fatale's mystery soon deepens as a smoky blend of myrrh and olibanum incense begin to cloud the room, draping themselves around a sweet floral bouquet and an increasingly creamy, sensuously full vanilla. As coffee and roasted barley bring a comforting, yet subtly edgy dose of warm and resinous character, a rich mahogany wood keeps everything in balance, providing enough robust unisex woodsiness to make this scent an easy recommendation for men and women alike. And for those of us who prefer a finely-sharpened blade to blunt force, Vanille Fatale is a sotto voce stunner, ideal for drawing the object of your seduction ever closer without shouting over the room. Think of it as the ultimate secret weapon- and deploy it accordingly.","saffron, coriander, frangipani, narcissus, coffee absolute, mahogany, roasted barley, vanilla, myrhh, olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63563.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tom ford always vanilla results never anything short spectacular enter vanille fatale purring prowling seductively fanged new vanilla scent whose initial subtleties belie dangerously glamorous depth within opening quiet fiery growl saffron coriander vanille fatale's mystery soon deepens smoky blend myrrh olibanum incense begin cloud room draping around sweet floral bouquet increasingly creamy sensuously full vanilla coffee roasted barley bring comforting yet subtly edgy dose warm resinous character rich mahogany wood keeps everything balance providing enough robust unisex woodsiness make scent easy recommendation men women alike us prefer finely sharpened blade blunt force vanille fatale sotto voce stunner ideal drawing object seduction ever closer without shouting room think ultimate secret weapon deploy accordingly,"saffron, coriander, frangipani, narcissus, coffee absolute, mahogany, roasted barley, vanilla, myrhh, olibanum"
Tsuki Eau de Parfum,Di Ser,"Tsuki, meaning 'moon', is a wild green scent that captures the thrilling unfamiliarity of Japanese herbs and aromatics. Imagine crushing the leaves of some strange herb between your fingers in the dark and not knowing what it is, exactly. The minty, rosy sting of geranium is clearly identifiable, but you also smell something like crushed lemon balm and coriander beneath that. The aroma is green, minty, herbaceous, citrusy, and also gin-like thanks to a generous dose of juniper berry. But perhaps the most defining feature here is the fresh, vegetal scent of fennel, which gives the background of the scent a lingering anisic sweetness. Strangely enough, even if you've never been to Japan or smelled Japanese herbs and aromatics before, there is something that marks this scent out as clearly Japanese, rather than Chinese or Indian - possibly its sense of delicacy and restraint. After a bold start, the scent whittles down into a shadowy trace of powdered ginger and licorice root that, although not loud in volume, remains a gentling presence that calms and focuses the mind throughout the day. With its energizing and uplifting qualities, Tsuki is truly a health tonic in scent form: we can imagine it being doled out in therapeutic doses by doctors to tired, stressed-out patients. Detox from the noise of modern life with this wonderful little elixir.","geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tsuki meaning 'moon' wild green scent captures thrilling unfamiliarity japanese herbs aromatics imagine crushing leaves strange herb fingers dark knowing exactly minty rosy sting geranium clearly identifiable also smell something like crushed lemon balm coriander beneath aroma green minty herbaceous citrusy also gin like thanks generous dose juniper berry perhaps defining feature fresh vegetal scent fennel gives background scent lingering anisic sweetness strangely enough even never japan smelled japanese herbs aromatics something marks scent clearly japanese rather chinese indian possibly sense delicacy restraint bold start scent whittles shadowy trace powdered ginger licorice root although loud volume remains gentling presence calms focuses mind throughout day energizing uplifting qualities tsuki truly health tonic scent form imagine doled therapeutic doses doctors tired stressed patients detox noise modern life wonderful little elixir,"geranium, grapefruit, coriander, basil, lemon, fennel, juniper, spicy mint, patchouli"
"Feb. 14, 1912 Eau de Parfum",Rundholz Parfums,"Warm and cool, sharp and milky, rooty and bright, Feb.14, 1912 is a study in rich contrasts. Opening with a rich, bittersweet burst of citrus cut with deep aromatic notes of star anise, fennel, and licorice, the scent soon reveals a deep, rich iris note, waxy, rooty and so smoothly earthy as to almost be papyrus-like. A distinctive milk note softens the dryness of the florals, adding comfort and contrast. And in place of the incense that makes up the backbone of most Rundholz fragrances, here a distinguished, balsamic leather note plays that part, bridging the gap between the spicy, the creamy, the musky and the floral. Refined and understated, yet complex and deeply resonant, Feb.14, 1912 is unmistakably a Rundholz creation- and also unlike anything they've offered before.","orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,warm cool sharp milky rooty bright feb study rich contrasts opening rich bittersweet burst citrus cut deep aromatic notes star anise fennel licorice scent soon reveals deep rich iris note waxy rooty smoothly earthy almost papyrus like distinctive milk note softens dryness florals adding comfort contrast place incense makes backbone rundholz fragrances distinguished balsamic leather note plays part bridging gap spicy creamy musky floral refined understated yet complex deeply resonant feb unmistakably rundholz creation also unlike anything they've offered,"orange, bergamot, star anise, fennel, licorice, milk, iris, rose, jasmine, ylang-ylang, heliotrope, carnation, carrot seed, cedar, white musk, leather, tonka"
Sasora Parfum,Di Ser,"Sasora, like all other fragrances in the Di Ser range, is 100% all natural, and features the finest absolutes and essences available in the world. Sasora is named for one of the 6 fragrant types of aloeswood (agarwood) traditionally used in the Kodo ceremony, the art of 'listening' to Japanese incense: sasora, kyara, manaban, rakoku, sumontara, and managa. Cool and sour, sasora is thought to be equivalent to the first and finest batches of wild Hindi oud brought out of the jungles of Assam, in Northern India, and distilled exclusively for the use by the royal families of the Arabian Peninsula. The sasora oud oil used in this fragrance is 100% pure and of the highest quality available. Its scent profile boasts a monastic purity that reminds some of kyara, especially in the first few moments when it is heated over ash and mica plates as incense. However, the main characteristic of sasora is a herbal sourness, and it is this quality that has been accentuated in Sasora, the perfume.
The citrusy brightness of yuzu is first to buzz the palate, cleansing the mind of all clutter and preparing the way for a Zen-like state of bliss. The citrus is followed by the biting greenness of camphor and the medicinal, lavender-like properties of spikenard, a herb grown high in the Himalayas. Both camphor and spikenard are beloved notes in Japanese culture, representing the herbaceous bitterness of snow-covered herbs and moss in a Japanese forest. Considered spiritually cleansing as well as elevating, these materials are typically used to flank aloeswood in traditional Japanese incense sticks. And indeed, Sasora does smell like the finest aloeswood incense from Shoyeido and Baieido â herbal, bittersweet, spicy, and medicinal at first, with a silky finish of sweet, powdered woods. The rosewood truly shines here, framing the precious oud oil and spikenard against a spicy, aromatic backdrop of rosin and the interior of a hand-carved musical instrument. Real oud oil from noble Assamese stock, stripped of its leathery animalism and polished to a high shine with herbs, aromatics, and yuzu â this might be the first oud fragrance we're tempted to wear in hot weather or even to the office.","yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sasora like fragrances di ser range natural features finest absolutes essences available world sasora named one fragrant types aloeswood agarwood traditionally used kodo ceremony art 'listening' japanese incense sasora kyara manaban rakoku sumontara managa cool sour sasora thought equivalent first finest batches wild hindi oud brought jungles assam northern india distilled exclusively use royal families arabian peninsula sasora oud oil used fragrance pure highest quality available scent profile boasts monastic purity reminds kyara especially first moments heated ash mica plates incense however main characteristic sasora herbal sourness quality accentuated sasora perfume citrusy brightness yuzu first buzz palate cleansing mind clutter preparing way zen like state bliss citrus followed biting greenness camphor medicinal lavender like properties spikenard herb grown high himalayas camphor spikenard beloved notes japanese culture representing herbaceous bitterness snow covered herbs moss japanese forest considered spiritually cleansing well elevating materials typically used flank aloeswood traditional japanese incense sticks indeed sasora smell like finest aloeswood incense shoyeido baieido herbal bittersweet spicy medicinal first silky finish sweet powdered woods rosewood truly shines framing precious oud oil spikenard spicy aromatic backdrop rosin interior hand carved musical instrument real oud oil noble assamese stock stripped leathery animalism polished high shine herbs aromatics yuzu might first oud fragrance we're tempted wear hot weather even office,"yuzu, agarwood, camphor, jatamansi (spikenard), palisander rosewood"
Kyara Parfum,Di Ser,"Japanese treatment of agarwood in perfumery is completely different from that of Middle-Eastern perfumery, so let's take a minute to re-set expectations. Since the 6th century AD, the Japanese have used kyara agarwood in the Kodo ceremony (the way of incense), which is the art of 'listening' to scent. Kyara is a very special type of agarwood. It refers to wood from extremely old, wild-grown agarwood trees in mostly Vietnam, now rare to the point of being extinct. The word 'kyara' is a description of a scent profile, but also used in grading to mean the highest quality of agarwood. Most authentic kyara pieces were sold to private collectors in Japan, which is how Di Ser came into possession of its own small collection of the precious wood. Kyara is normally heated gently over ash and mica plates as incense; due to its rarity and scarcity, it is never used for distilling oud oil. Until now, that is. In an unprecedented move, Di Ser took the decision to distill oil from its own private collection of kyara. This was an enormously bold and risky undertaking, considering the expense of the raw material, the tiny yield, and the difficulty in extracting oil from such densely-resinated wood. Most oud oil fanatics will never have smelled genuine kyara, either in oil or incense form, so this fragrance, Kyara, is literally the opportunity of a lifetime. The holy grail of oud. Kyara has a uniquely resinous, green aroma when burned, said to be calming and transporting in equal measure. The opening notes of this 100% natural fragrance are, in fact, pure kyara â verdant, minty, and slightly antiseptic, with the evergreen sting of camphor. Although recognizably oud, the note is as vaporous and clean as early morning mist in a Japanese forest -never dirty or smoky. A massive, gauzy rose note swells up behind the green kyara opening, fleshing out the kyara into a luminous rose-oud concerto against a spicy-woody backdrop that feels like powdered ginger root diffused in sunlight. In keeping with the Japanese classification of oud as rokkoku gomi (meaning ""of six countries"" and the bitter taste from â the five tastes of sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty'), the sweetness and powder is kept in check by the peppery, balsamic-vinegar underbite typical of Vietnamese agarwood. If you've grown weary of oud or simply dislike the more animalic, Arabic treatment of the material, then re-set your nose and give yourself a treat with Kyara, the Japanese silk screen of the oud world. Di Ser's Kyara represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to smell authentic kyara agarwood in liquid form â do not cheat yourself of this experience!","kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,japanese treatment agarwood perfumery completely different middle eastern perfumery let's take minute set expectations since th century ad japanese used kyara agarwood kodo ceremony way incense art 'listening' scent kyara special type agarwood refers wood extremely old wild grown agarwood trees mostly vietnam rare point extinct word 'kyara' description scent profile also used grading mean highest quality agarwood authentic kyara pieces sold private collectors japan di ser came possession small collection precious wood kyara normally heated gently ash mica plates incense due rarity scarcity never used distilling oud oil unprecedented move di ser took decision distill oil private collection kyara enormously bold risky undertaking considering expense raw material tiny yield difficulty extracting oil densely resinated wood oud oil fanatics never smelled genuine kyara either oil incense form fragrance kyara literally opportunity lifetime holy grail oud kyara uniquely resinous green aroma burned said calming transporting equal measure opening notes natural fragrance fact pure kyara verdant minty slightly antiseptic evergreen sting camphor although recognizably oud note vaporous clean early morning mist japanese forest never dirty smoky massive gauzy rose note swells behind green kyara opening fleshing kyara luminous rose oud concerto spicy woody backdrop feels like powdered ginger root diffused sunlight keeping japanese classification oud rokkoku gomi meaning six countries bitter taste five tastes sweet bitter sour pungent salty' sweetness powder kept check peppery balsamic vinegar underbite typical vietnamese agarwood grown weary oud simply dislike animalic arabic treatment material set nose give treat kyara japanese silk screen oud world di ser's kyara represents lifetime opportunity smell authentic kyara agarwood liquid form cheat experience,"kyara grade agarwood, cedarwood, rose otto, patchouli, sandalwood"
Hasunoito Parfum,Di Ser,"Hasunoito is based on the lotus flower, the symbol of Di Ser and revered throughout Japan, India, and most Eastern Asian countries for its spiritual significance. The oil of both white and pink lotus is so costly and rare that Di Ser has chosen to focus mostly on the abstract idea of a lotus blossom shooting up through the soil, displaying the duality of strength and softness so characteristic of the flower. And indeed, the first half of the perfume puts forth a convincing portrait of earth. The specific type of agarwood used here smells like cold, damp clay, with a fuzzy golden haze of something medicinal, like flowers dipped into an antiseptic ointment. Boronia absolute, used only in the most luxurious of all-natural perfumery, lends a fresh, spicy-fruity accent, like purple berries doused in wintergreen and clove. Despite the presence of lotus, rose, ylang, and jasmine, nothing about this perfume reads as floral in tone; rather, it smells like a pleasantly earthy, spicy tea filtered through hospital gauze. Arresting, different, and ultimately kind of addictive, Hasunoito is for people who wish to access higher planes of spirituality without going through the more hackneyed route of incense and flowers.","oud, sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hasunoito based lotus flower symbol di ser revered throughout japan india eastern asian countries spiritual significance oil white pink lotus costly rare di ser chosen focus mostly abstract idea lotus blossom shooting soil displaying duality strength softness characteristic flower indeed first half perfume puts forth convincing portrait earth specific type agarwood used smells like cold damp clay fuzzy golden haze something medicinal like flowers dipped antiseptic ointment boronia absolute used luxurious natural perfumery lends fresh spicy fruity accent like purple berries doused wintergreen clove despite presence lotus rose ylang jasmine nothing perfume reads floral tone rather smells like pleasantly earthy spicy tea filtered hospital gauze arresting different ultimately kind addictive hasunoito people wish access higher planes spirituality without going hackneyed route incense flowers,"oud, sweet orange, boronia, ylang-ylang, jasmine sambac, lotus, rose"
Akanesasu Eau de Parfum,Di Ser,"Akane sasu sora, a wonderfully evocative phrase used in traditional Japanese poetry to express the vivid red glow of a particularly beautiful sunset. It's a phrase imbued with splendor, suggesting that there are unique moments where the natural world drifts especially close to the supernatural realm, with awe-inspiring results. To be certain, a fragrance that draws on this lovely imagery must contain the same power, the same energy, the same reverence. Luckily, this eye-openingly bright, joyous and rich ode to citrus, jasmine and vetiver is every bit as compelling as its namesake. As if to mirror the color progression of a sunset, Akanesasu opens with a vivid burst of orange and bergamot, where intense green coexists with the warm orange of juicy citrus fruit, mouthwatering and energizing. A rich, fresh jasmine heart (nothing heady or indolic here) positively glows with quiet majesty, and an emergent vetiver base eschews the spikier side of the note in favor of gently woodsy warmth, leaving you with the contented relaxation one feels as the sun dips behind the mountains, leaving the sky painted red. A fragrance for summer sunsets and moments of appreciation, Akanesasu is poetry in a bottle.","orange, bergamot, jasmine sambac, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78805.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,akane sasu sora wonderfully evocative phrase used traditional japanese poetry express vivid red glow particularly beautiful sunset phrase imbued splendor suggesting unique moments natural world drifts especially close supernatural realm awe inspiring results certain fragrance draws lovely imagery must contain power energy reverence luckily eye openingly bright joyous rich ode citrus jasmine vetiver every bit compelling namesake mirror color progression sunset akanesasu opens vivid burst orange bergamot intense green coexists warm orange juicy citrus fruit mouthwatering energizing rich fresh jasmine heart nothing heady indolic positively glows quiet majesty emergent vetiver base eschews spikier side note favor gently woodsy warmth leaving contented relaxation one feels sun dips behind mountains leaving sky painted red fragrance summer sunsets moments appreciation akanesasu poetry bottle,"orange, bergamot, jasmine sambac, vetiver"
Shiragoromo Parfum,Di Ser,"Shiragoromo is an amalgamation of two words, shira (meaning white) and goromo (meaning cloth). White is a sacred color in Japan, even appearing as the main color on the Japanese flag, because it stands for purity and childlike innocence. The fragrance itself also smells clean and pure. Predominantly a simple, natural blend of bright yuzu and earthy green woods, Shiragoromo manages to give the feel of a sun-dappled citrus grove that is nonetheless clearly a Japanese citrus grove. The opening is both sweet and medicinal - oranges and yuzu with the antiseptic bitterness of green aloeswood lurking directly beneath. The purity of the Di Ser approach to perfumery shines through strongly here and great thought has been given to the balance of all five taste elements of Japanese culture: sweet, bitter, sour, pungent and salty. It takes a long time for the floral elements to break free of the grip of medicinal yuzu and earthy woods, but finally a clean, radiant white jasmine steps out into the clearing. That the flower feels like an extension of the citrus and woods is testament to both the skill of the perfumer and the delicacy of the jasmine oil used here. If you like the idea of white flower petals filtered through damp, earthy green woods and exuberant citrus, then look to Shiragoromo. It's the rare white floral that doesn't actually behave or smell like one; glimpsed at an oblique angle and shaped into something new by the other materials, Shiragoromo feels like a fresh take on a much-traveled theme.","agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,shiragoromo amalgamation two words shira meaning white goromo meaning cloth white sacred color japan even appearing main color japanese flag stands purity childlike innocence fragrance also smells clean pure predominantly simple natural blend bright yuzu earthy green woods shiragoromo manages give feel sun dappled citrus grove nonetheless clearly japanese citrus grove opening sweet medicinal oranges yuzu antiseptic bitterness green aloeswood lurking directly beneath purity di ser approach perfumery shines strongly great thought given balance five taste elements japanese culture sweet bitter sour pungent salty takes long time floral elements break free grip medicinal yuzu earthy woods finally clean radiant white jasmine steps clearing flower feels like extension citrus woods testament skill perfumer delicacy jasmine oil used like idea white flower petals filtered damp earthy green woods exuberant citrus look shiragoromo rare white floral actually behave smell like one glimpsed oblique angle shaped something new materials shiragoromo feels like fresh take much traveled theme,"agarwood, yuzu, jasmine sambac, rose"
Suleyman le Magnifique Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"The longest-reigning sultan of the Ottoman Empire, Suleyman I presided over the empire's golden age, marked by massive conquest and expansion, cutting edge political and societal reform, and some of the world's greatest artistic and cultural output- to say nothing of his legendary, passionate love for his wife Roxelana, elevated from his harem to be his queen in bold defiance of tradition and convention. This is the man Rasei Fort pays tribute to with Suleyman le Magnifique, a fragrance that celebrates the Sultan's dynamic complexity by blending notes both softly sweet and ferociously animalic. An amalgamation of florals, spice, incense and resin, it's a powerfully irresistible ode to the opulence of an illustrious empire, contrasting bitter-green galbanum against syrupy amber, earthy patchouli with juicy red apple and fiery cinnamon, all against a backdrop of deep, animalic oud. Luxurious, sumptuous and sophisticated, Suleyman le Magnifique is a truly fitting homage to one of history's great figures.","galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,longest reigning sultan ottoman empire suleyman presided empire's golden age marked massive conquest expansion cutting edge political societal reform world's greatest artistic cultural output say nothing legendary passionate love wife roxelana elevated harem queen bold defiance tradition convention man rasei fort pays tribute suleyman le magnifique fragrance celebrates sultan's dynamic complexity blending notes softly sweet ferociously animalic amalgamation florals spice incense resin powerfully irresistible ode opulence illustrious empire contrasting bitter green galbanum syrupy amber earthy patchouli juicy red apple fiery cinnamon backdrop deep animalic oud luxurious sumptuous sophisticated suleyman le magnifique truly fitting homage one history's great figures,"galbanum, amber, musk, benzoin, patchouli, vetiver, oud, sandalwood, rose, tuberose, vanilla, ambergris, cinnamon, red apple"
Charlatan Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"From our very first encounter, Fort & Manle has blown us away with their ability to tell wonderfully targeted stories with their scents- tales where the fragrances themselves go far beyond ""matching the mood"" of the copy and become genuine narratives in their own right. Charlatan, a tale of seduction, deception, betrayal, and sin, is by these standards truly a masterwork. Opening with sweetly soft, romantic pear dipped in luscious chocolate, the opening notes evoke a gentle and charming courtship. Even as an element of carnality is introduced via black Perigord truffle, it builds into a passionate symphony of Damascene rose and a lush supporting floral cast, a flirtation exploded into a full-blown romance. Only as a deeply earthy amber and surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter the picture do we see the twist- an element of danger has saturated our storybook, and the elaborate bouquet may contain poison at the center. But then again, some lovers thrive on the edge. Sweet and soft, dark and dangerous, Charlatan is an incredibly creative scent that you'll enjoy experiencing as much as those around you.","pear, chocolate, perigord truffle, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, vanilla bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first encounter fort manle blown us away ability tell wonderfully targeted stories scents tales fragrances go far beyond matching mood copy become genuine narratives right charlatan tale seduction deception betrayal sin standards truly masterwork opening sweetly soft romantic pear dipped luscious chocolate opening notes evoke gentle charming courtship even element carnality introduced via black perigord truffle builds passionate symphony damascene rose lush supporting floral cast flirtation exploded full blown romance deeply earthy amber surprisingly spicy sandalwood enter picture see twist element danger saturated storybook elaborate bouquet may contain poison center lovers thrive edge sweet soft dark dangerous charlatan incredibly creative scent enjoy experiencing much around,"pear, chocolate, perigord truffle, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, vanilla bean, amber"
Confessions of a Garden Gnome Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"One does not often consider the humble nobility of the garden gnome, and yet his stoicism in the face of the ever-changing seasons is, in its own way, quite beautiful. Confessions of a Garden Gnome pays tribute to this stalwart steward of your backyard, whisking us through a whimsically enchanting year's worth of weather in a single spray, an experience that proves to be as creative and delightful as any we've had in niche fragrance. Confessions opens in springtime, a crisp, green breeze of yuzu-inflected bergamot atop a dewey musk. Summertime warmth emerges in the pulpy sweetness of mango and the smooth floral greenness of lily of the valley and lush rose, while autumn beckons from around the corner with crackling cedarwood and salty ambergris. Ultimately, the darkening wood notes lead into winter, while glowing amber suggests the warmth and comfort lurking just out of reach of our heroic gnome, frozen as he is to his territory. It's a wonderful piece of craftsmanship, an ever-evolving fragrant experience that must be worn to be believed. Mister Gnome, we salute you.","cedar, musk, bergamot, coriander, yuzu, pink pepper, lily of the valley, mango, rose, violet leaf, ambergris, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78102.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one often consider humble nobility garden gnome yet stoicism face ever changing seasons way quite beautiful confessions garden gnome pays tribute stalwart steward backyard whisking us whimsically enchanting year's worth weather single spray experience proves creative delightful we've niche fragrance confessions opens springtime crisp green breeze yuzu inflected bergamot atop dewey musk summertime warmth emerges pulpy sweetness mango smooth floral greenness lily valley lush rose autumn beckons around corner crackling cedarwood salty ambergris ultimately darkening wood notes lead winter glowing amber suggests warmth comfort lurking reach heroic gnome frozen territory wonderful piece craftsmanship ever evolving fragrant experience must worn believed mister gnome salute,"cedar, musk, bergamot, coriander, yuzu, pink pepper, lily valley, mango, rose, violet leaf, ambergris, amber"
Amber Absolutely Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"Amber fragrances are often associated with warmth, comfort, and beauty- but can an amber be dangerous? In the hands of Rasei Fort- absolutely. Here, the dynamic new nose behind Fort & Manle envisions amber as a trap, a seduction, glowing so brightly that those drawn to its light cannot realize they've become the prey... until it's too late. Don't get us wrong- this is one of the most delicious, warm and downright rapturous ambers we've experienced- rich, resinous labdanum, spiked with benzoin, sweetened with a golden honey and juicy plum. But an unexpectedly striking note of rose manages to feel both lush and thorny, and raw, spicy vetiver splices with stout cedarwood to deliver a powerful bite when least expected.

Fatih Sultan Mehmed Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"A tribute to the opulence and glory of the Ottoman Sultanic Empire, Fatih Sultan Mehmed is a grand fragrance indeed, well worthy of the outsized reputation of Mehmed the Conqueror. Crisp, juicy apple bursts off the skin from the very first spritz, while a heart of romantically smooth flowers- lush Damask rose and vibrant iris- balances expertly against gorgeously textured, gently spicy ambergris, keeping the floral heart both lively and unisex. Finally, a sumptuous drydown of woods, musks and resins further accentuates the lavish character of the scent, allowing the complexity of the ingredients to remain front and center while never feeling as heavy or spice-laden as your typical exotic oriental. Ambergris lovers, we recommend getting your hands on this scent today- put simply, Fatih Sultan Mehmed smells like a million bucks.","bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tribute opulence glory ottoman sultanic empire fatih sultan mehmed grand fragrance indeed well worthy outsized reputation mehmed conqueror crisp juicy apple bursts skin first spritz heart romantically smooth flowers lush damask rose vibrant iris balances expertly gorgeously textured gently spicy ambergris keeping floral heart lively unisex finally sumptuous drydown woods musks resins accentuates lavish character scent allowing complexity ingredients remain front center never feeling heavy spice laden typical exotic oriental ambergris lovers recommend getting hands scent today put simply fatih sultan mehmed smells like million bucks,"bergamot, apple, petitgrain, rose, tulip, iris, vanilla bean, benzoin, amber, ambergris, cedar, patchouli, oud"
Harem Rose Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"A soliflore is a big test for a young perfume house- when the adornments of complicated genres and endless ingredient lists are stripped away, when the goal is to deliver one simple, beautiful floral, how will it deliver? With Harem Rose, a gorgeous rose soliflore with gently oriental elements, we have our answer. Yes, it's a rose scent, but not all roses are created equal, and the Damascene Rose that Rasei Fort presents here is ethereal, a lush but youthful pink rose floating on a wave of soothing musk, gentle vanilla and the slightest hint of earth and spice from a subdued vetiver. The result is substance without heaviness, a truly three dimensional rose without a single thorn, a fresh floral that sinks happily into cloudlike repose.

Maduro Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"In 1961, a Cuban cargo ship, the Reina del Mar, was intercepted by Barbadian pirates on its way to the United States. The ship was scuttled in the ocean and its cargo- tropical fruits and, more importantly, a crate of rare, priceless Cohiba Maduro cigars- sank to the bottom of the ocean. With Maduro, Fort & Manle reimagine the deep, intoxicating aroma of that cargo hold as an explosion of herbaceous spice, fruit, and rich tobacco, a smoky-sweet woody gourmand with unparalleled depth. Clean, vibrant fruit and spice collide with rich, resinous amber, earthy patchouli is smoothed with warm vanilla and woods, and at the center, an intriguingly complex tobacco- dry and spicy one moment, sweet and musty the next. The Reina del Mar may have shipwrecked, but Maduro, the fragrance it inspired, is a magnificent vessel indeed.","basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cuban cargo ship reina del mar intercepted barbadian pirates way united states ship scuttled ocean cargo tropical fruits importantly crate rare priceless cohiba maduro cigars sank bottom ocean maduro fort manle reimagine deep intoxicating aroma cargo hold explosion herbaceous spice fruit rich tobacco smoky sweet woody gourmand unparalleled depth clean vibrant fruit spice collide rich resinous amber earthy patchouli smoothed warm vanilla woods center intriguingly complex tobacco dry spicy one moment sweet musty next reina del mar may shipwrecked maduro fragrance inspired magnificent vessel indeed,"basil, apple, pineapple, amber, tobacco, beeswax, cinnamon leaf, vanilla, patchouli, vetiver, benzoin, cedar"
Bojnokopff Eau de Parfum,Fort & Manle,"An extravagant homage to the showmanship of pre-revolution Russia's master illusionists, Bojnokopff (formerly titled Mr. Bojnokopff's Purple Hat) is itself a throwback- a sweet, smoky, darkly woodsy gourmand that defies characterization even as it enchants all who encounter it. Our grand illusion opens with a deep, dark oud note, pungent enough to avoid the dreaded ""medicinal"" tag but pleasantly balanced with wispy wood smoke and a complementary vein of smooth, clean French lavender. As the act progresses, the smoke pouring from our titular hat begins to thicken and billow, taking on the warm creaminess of vanilla and the indulgent richness of Belgian chocolate, simultaneously mouthwatering and, in harmony with the ever-present oud, seductively mysterious. As the smoke fills the stage, deep, spicy woodsiness prevails, with gaiac and cedar combining with an almost oily vetiver to delightful effect- when the smoke finally clears, only the hat itself remains on stage. Who is the mysterious Mr. Bojnokopff, and how can his magical fragrance be both deliciously gourmand and seductively woodsy all at once? Would you really want to spoil the illusion by finding out?","oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,extravagant homage showmanship pre revolution russia's master illusionists bojnokopff formerly titled mr bojnokopff's purple hat throwback sweet smoky darkly woodsy gourmand defies characterization even enchants encounter grand illusion opens deep dark oud note pungent enough avoid dreaded medicinal tag pleasantly balanced wispy wood smoke complementary vein smooth clean french lavender act progresses smoke pouring titular hat begins thicken billow taking warm creaminess vanilla indulgent richness belgian chocolate simultaneously mouthwatering harmony ever present oud seductively mysterious smoke fills stage deep spicy woodsiness prevails gaiac cedar combining almost oily vetiver delightful effect smoke finally clears hat remains stage mysterious mr bojnokopff magical fragrance deliciously gourmand seductively woodsy would really want spoil illusion finding,"oud, lavender, vanilla, chocolate, vetiver, gaiac, cedar"
Slowdive Eau de Parfum,Hiram Green Perfumes,"Is the name of Hiram Green's latest all-natural stunner a reference to Slowdive, the seminal UK shoegaze band who recently made a triumphant return to recording after a two-decade absence? The perfumer's notes are vague, referencing only ""the mood of those languid afternoons when the sweetness of the Indian summer air is almost palpable."" But it's not like those two concepts are unrelated- after all, the best shoegaze music is a lot like that feeling Green describes- an intense, steady hum of warmth and light, almost embryonic in its soothing envelopment. This is the feeling of Slowdive, a richly honeyed bouquet of potent white florals, hazily syrupy and mouthwateringly sweet, with a spicy-floral tobacco blossom featured at the center. The result is a gloriously but carefully balanced overdrive of olfactive noise, a fuzz of ambered, resinous fruits, lush, narcotic florals and invigorating spice, and the newest example of Hiram Green's remarkable ability to make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation. While the connection between fragrance and band remains (appropriately) blurry, we can't help but feel that they'd approve.","neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name hiram green's latest natural stunner reference slowdive seminal uk shoegaze band recently made triumphant return recording two decade absence perfumer's notes vague referencing mood languid afternoons sweetness indian summer air almost palpable like two concepts unrelated best shoegaze music lot like feeling green describes intense steady hum warmth light almost embryonic soothing envelopment feeling slowdive richly honeyed bouquet potent white florals hazily syrupy mouthwateringly sweet spicy floral tobacco blossom featured center result gloriously carefully balanced overdrive olfactive noise fuzz ambered resinous fruits lush narcotic florals invigorating spice newest example hiram green's remarkable ability make disarmingly complex natural fragrances without limitation connection fragrance band remains appropriately blurry can't help feel they'd approve,"neroli, orange flower, tobacco blossom, tuberose, honey, dried fruit, resin"
Baque Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse,"We'd heard talk of Baque, a long-discontinued Slumberhouse original that pre-dated our relationship with Josh Lobb's tantalizing creations, but truth be told, we weren't too worried about it. How could a different Slumberhouse tobacco scent steal our hearts away from the mouthwatering fruit-laced smoking pipe of Kiste, or the smoky-sweet darkness of (dearly departed) Jeke? But now, Baque is, well, back, and we're delighted to discover that it's a dynamic, vividly-painted tobacco scent that lands squarely in the middle of our two previous favorites. Combining syrupy, fruity apricot with sweet, spicy tobacco and a deep strain of boozy richness, Baque hypnotizes and delights, seduces and compels, and most importantly, draws us deep within an vivid, gorgeous imaginary landscape as only Slumberhouse can.","apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,we'd heard talk baque long discontinued slumberhouse original pre dated relationship josh lobb's tantalizing creations truth told worried could different slumberhouse tobacco scent steal hearts away mouthwatering fruit laced smoking pipe kiste smoky sweet darkness dearly departed jeke baque well back we're delighted discover dynamic vividly painted tobacco scent lands squarely middle two previous favorites combining syrupy fruity apricot sweet spicy tobacco deep strain boozy richness baque hypnotizes delights seduces compels importantly draws us deep within vivid gorgeous imaginary landscape slumberhouse,"apricot, cedar, straw, vanilla, tobacco leaf, davana, ambergris, parchment"
Camel Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Camel is a series of elegant contradictions. Technically, it's an oriental, but in sidestepping all of the cliches of the genre, it retains a surprisingly brisk, fat-free mien. It features a plethora of rich, sticky notes like dates and dried fruit, but is as dry as a glass of champagne. Frankincense, musk, and oud lend a sinuous exoticism that speaks to the East; yet Camel has a distinctly retro flourish that places it firmly among the flanks of classic French perfumes such as My Sin and Arpege. We sense several shifting layers of scent in Camel, all of them fascinating. First, a topnote of dried fruit dipped in green frankincense sets the pace: resinous, rich, but also dry, tart almost. Imagine the steamy sweetness of dried apricots and plums laid out in a souk, pricked by the waxy sourness of preserved lemons and pickled mangoes just beneath. The mouthwatering notes of the opening give way to an animalic floral heart â a none-too-clean jasmine and orange blossom whipped into a soapy, leathery froth by civet and musk. All this is spread over a gritty amber drydown that manages to smell like the friction between hot sand, cold soap, and silk sheets. Although Camel strikes us as more Madame Bovary than Scheherazade, it nonetheless manages to capture the contradictory nature of the camel, itself permanently poised between froideur and rage.","dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76017.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,camel series elegant contradictions technically oriental sidestepping cliches genre retains surprisingly brisk fat free mien features plethora rich sticky notes like dates dried fruit dry glass champagne frankincense musk oud lend sinuous exoticism speaks east yet camel distinctly retro flourish places firmly among flanks classic french perfumes sin arpege sense several shifting layers scent camel fascinating first topnote dried fruit dipped green frankincense sets pace resinous rich also dry tart almost imagine steamy sweetness dried apricots plums laid souk pricked waxy sourness preserved lemons pickled mangoes beneath mouthwatering notes opening give way animalic floral heart none clean jasmine orange blossom whipped soapy leathery froth civet musk spread gritty amber drydown manages smell like friction hot sand cold soap silk sheets although camel strikes us madame bovary scheherazade nonetheless manages capture contradictory nature camel permanently poised froideur rage,"dried fruits, frankincense, palm date, rose, amber, cedar, cinnamon, incense, jasmine, myrrh, orange blossom, civet, musk, sandalwood, oud, tonka, vanilla, vetiver"
Day Dreams Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Like the warm summer nights in Greece, where the daylight is endless and the air is ripe with flowers. Montale's whisper-soft Day Dreams is about what is left when all cares melt away. A juicy burst of mandarin opens up a romantic whirlwind of white flowers - neroli, jasmine, orange blossom - and a tropical hit of tiare.

Arabians,Montale,"Arabians is about capturing that feeling of royal adventure, with wind in your hair and a lover by your side. Inspired by the King of the Desert, the Arabian Horse, this regal fragrance takes the classic fougere and takes it for a musky, sensually spiced spin. Sweet clean lavender heads the way, accompanied by a sexy blend of cardamom, rose, warm patchouli, and the most subtle use of oud by Montale we've seen yet.

Ummagumma Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"As a multi-sensory artist, Bruno Fazzolari's creations pulse with the energy of magical realms, from the blazing glow of Feu Secret to the crackling fluorescents of Room 237. But with Ummagumma, Fazzolari ushers us into his darkest, sultriest locale yet- a languorous world of rich gourmand notes that flow with indulgently deliberate sweetness- aromatic, smooth tobacco, resinous labdanum, creamy vanilla and sandalwood- and foremost of all, a mouthwateringly warm, rich chocolate note, sweet and robust without a drop of fake sugar. This is an adult gourmand, a scent to be savored, evocatively sexy on men or women, young or old. Perhaps it's not right to call it a gourmand at all- it's a portal to yet another world that defies too-simple categorization while at the same time feeling immeasurably appropriate for the one category it firmly falls into- that of an original Bruno Fazzolari creation. Chocolate lovers, winter adventurers, and all who appreciate original art- don't miss Ummagumma.","saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,multi sensory artist bruno fazzolari's creations pulse energy magical realms blazing glow feu secret crackling fluorescents room ummagumma fazzolari ushers us darkest sultriest locale yet languorous world rich gourmand notes flow indulgently deliberate sweetness aromatic smooth tobacco resinous labdanum creamy vanilla sandalwood foremost mouthwateringly warm rich chocolate note sweet robust without drop fake sugar adult gourmand scent savored evocatively sexy men women young old perhaps right call gourmand portal yet another world defies simple categorization time feeling immeasurably appropriate one category firmly falls original bruno fazzolari creation chocolate lovers winter adventurers appreciate original art miss ummagumma,"saffron, carnation, chocolate, tobacco, leather, labdanum, sandalwood, cedar, frankincense, tonka bean, vanilla"
Black Vanilla Eau de Parfum,Mancera,"Black Vanilla by Mancera is a milky floral vanilla that soothes rather than challenges, which is exactly what we all need every now and then. Soft hints of blackcurrants, coconut, and peach cast a gauzy veil of fruit over the vanilla accord, itself sheer and barely sweet, like coconut milk put through a milk frother. The juicy berries and peach lend a discreetly flirtatious vibe, but in general, the lack of syrupy sweetness marks this out as a refined, grown-up vanilla scent. In time, a powdery rose emerges from the peachy, berried vanilla froth, creamy puffs of jasmine petals and candied violet trailing soon after. The florals, diffused in an enormous cloud of soapy white musk, feel more like a swirl of expensive cosmetic powder than freshly-cut flowers, giving the scent a distinctly clean, feminine vibe. In terms of sillage and longevity, Black Vanilla lasts the day, but is soft rather than loud. Despite the name, therefore, Black Vanilla is truly a perfect fragrance for days when you need your scent to stay low-key but still smell amazing. Gently feminine, its cluster of powdery flowers, musk, and lightly frothed vanilla-coconut milk feels more like a perfect veil of milky, floral lotion rather than a full-on perfume.","bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,black vanilla mancera milky floral vanilla soothes rather challenges exactly need every soft hints blackcurrants coconut peach cast gauzy veil fruit vanilla accord sheer barely sweet like coconut milk put milk frother juicy berries peach lend discreetly flirtatious vibe general lack syrupy sweetness marks refined grown vanilla scent time powdery rose emerges peachy berried vanilla froth creamy puffs jasmine petals candied violet trailing soon florals diffused enormous cloud soapy white musk feel like swirl expensive cosmetic powder freshly cut flowers giving scent distinctly clean feminine vibe terms sillage longevity black vanilla lasts day soft rather loud despite name therefore black vanilla truly perfect fragrance days need scent stay low key still smell amazing gently feminine cluster powdery flowers musk lightly frothed vanilla coconut milk feels like perfect veil milky floral lotion rather full perfume,"bergamot, blackcurrant, coconut, white peach, rose, violet, jasmine, vanilla, white musk"
Red Tobacco Eau de Parfum,Mancera,"Red Tobacco by Mancera is an incredibly potent, sexy tobacco fragrance with enough spice to turn the heat up on a cold winter's night. The opening is deceptively sharp and fresh, a one-two punch of leathery saffron and crisp apple, bathed in a haze of that smoky, medicinal Mancera oud. This phase smells like oud chips fermenting in a vat of honey âÂ medicinal, slightly pungent, and deliciously sweet-n-sour. But it's not long before the scent shakes off any semblance of freshness and melts into a thick, juicy amber that smells like a river of molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco, dried plums, and fruitcake. Red Tobacco is so confidently spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon, it practically sizzles. With time, the sweet, rich pipe tobacco emerges from its bed of amber and spice to reveal itself as the true star. The bombastic sweetness of the scent is toned down a little by the slightly dirty, smoky oud note and a patchouli note that smells like damp dark chocolate. A naughty little cousin to Montale's Honey Aoud, Red Tobacco will warm your bones in winter and the blood of anyone who picks up your scent.","saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64931.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,red tobacco mancera incredibly potent sexy tobacco fragrance enough spice turn heat cold winter's night opening deceptively sharp fresh one two punch leathery saffron crisp apple bathed haze smoky medicinal mancera oud phase smells like oud chips fermenting vat honey medicinal slightly pungent deliciously sweet n sour long scent shakes semblance freshness melts thick juicy amber smells like river molten honeycomb coursing around pipe tobacco dried plums fruitcake red tobacco confidently spiced nutmeg cinnamon practically sizzles time sweet rich pipe tobacco emerges bed amber spice reveal true star bombastic sweetness scent toned little slightly dirty smoky oud note patchouli note smells like damp dark chocolate naughty little cousin montale's honey aoud red tobacco warm bones winter blood anyone picks scent,"saffron, cinnamon, incense, nutmeg, white pear, green apple, oud, patchouli, jasmine, tobacco, amber, guaiac wood, sandalwood, vetiver, vanilla, white musk"
California Snow Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"California Snow crackles with the electricity of a soiree high in the Hollywood Hills. White-blonde starlets loll on the lawn, rolling joints and listening to the sound of the coyotes. Studio execs, excited by the snowy mounds of illicit substances on every surface, long to engage. But the scent of the hot night air âÂ earth, sage, cannabis âÂ is too bewitching to focus on anything else. California Snow's glossy, filmed-in-HD surface belies a certainâÂearth mother' wildness. A rose so bright and crisp it smells more like an apple is the first surprise; the damp earthiness of the soil tincture the second. The combination of the crystalline with the muddy is utterly charming, like a glammed-up cool kid suddenly locating their hippy side, and kicking off their Jimmy Choos to roll around in the dirt. A witchy sage works with aromatic hay, chamomile, and wild mountain tea to dry out the scent, turning it from earthy and wet into something you might crumble up and smoke. It finishes as a gust of warm, grassy desert air off the scrublands high up in the Hollywood Hills. With its clever contrasting of crisp, clean notes with grungy, earthy ones, California Snow is provocative in a good-humored way, like a star who chooses to pair a pristine white tuxedo with beaten-up plimsolls for a red carpet event.","sage, tea, chamomile, coumarin, narcissus, rose, hay, cannabis, musk, soil tincture, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,california snow crackles electricity soiree high hollywood hills white blonde starlets loll lawn rolling joints listening sound coyotes studio execs excited snowy mounds illicit substances every surface long engage scent hot night air earth sage cannabis bewitching focus anything else california snow's glossy filmed hd surface belies certain earth mother' wildness rose bright crisp smells like apple first surprise damp earthiness soil tincture second combination crystalline muddy utterly charming like glammed cool kid suddenly locating hippy side kicking jimmy choos roll around dirt witchy sage works aromatic hay chamomile wild mountain tea dry scent turning earthy wet something might crumble smoke finishes gust warm grassy desert air scrublands high hollywood hills clever contrasting crisp clean notes grungy earthy ones california snow provocative good humored way like star chooses pair pristine white tuxedo beaten plimsolls red carpet event,"sage, tea, chamomile, coumarin, narcissus, rose, hay, cannabis, musk, soil tincture, vetiver, cedar"

Not a Perfume Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"""If my different creations had one thing in common, it would be the presence of an ingredient I am particularly fond of. Overdosed in Lady V and Calamity J, more discrete in Miss Charming and Citizen Queen, I use it regularly to bring elegance to my creations because of its unique and inimitable woody, musky finesse. So, this time I have created a perfume out of this one ingredient - a perfume that wouldn't be in the conventional sense of the term. I will leave you to discover it on your skin because it is only through contact that its secrets will be unveiled."" Romano Ricci, Founder
Along with today's minimalist trend, Not a Perfume follows suit and adds extremity, irreverence and conceptual characteristics to deliver a true art form. You have now stepped into a new and elegant form of perfumery. With Not a Perfume you get exactly what you want from the scent: it does not evolve; it is not a composition, but rather a particular fragrance that is very strong & lasting on skin. Just like the white packaging it's housed in, its makeup is fresh, clean, and clinical. This brand new concept from Romano Ricci is a modern day fragrance that is 100% synthetic and created without allergens. Not a Perfume is made of 1 single synthetic ingredient Cetalox. Cetalox is a molecular creation that comes from the organic research. Developed by Firmenich in the 1950's to replace Ambergris, a very rare natural secretion of whales, Ambroxan comes in the form of white crystals. It is usually used as a back note in perfume composition, even if its smell is curiously quite far from its original inspiration.",cetalox,https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,different creations one thing common would presence ingredient particularly fond overdosed lady v calamity j discrete miss charming citizen queen use regularly bring elegance creations unique inimitable woody musky finesse time created perfume one ingredient perfume conventional sense term leave discover skin contact secrets unveiled romano ricci founder along today's minimalist trend perfume follows suit adds extremity irreverence conceptual characteristics deliver true art form stepped new elegant form perfumery perfume get exactly want scent evolve composition rather particular fragrance strong lasting skin like white packaging housed makeup fresh clean clinical brand new concept romano ricci modern day fragrance synthetic created without allergens perfume made single synthetic ingredient cetalox cetalox molecular creation comes organic research developed firmenich 's replace ambergris rare natural secretion whales ambroxan comes form white crystals usually used back note perfume composition even smell curiously quite far original inspiration,cetalox
Mx. Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums,"Pronounced 'Mix', Mx. is named after the gender neutral title replacing Mr., Mrs. and Ms., announces a new gender fluid era where perfumes are not rigidly gendered. ""X"" marks the spot of freedom.
True to form, Mx. doesn't abstain from taking a position on gender â it leaves all options open. Mx. dances between sweet creaminess and brusque, aromatic woods, playing both sides of the fence with perfect poise and balance. Its mouthwatering, almost gourmand opening salvo of peppery saffron fits neatly over a heart of rugged Australian sandalwood and cedar spiked with black pepper, ginger, cacao and frankincense.
Dabs of castoreum and birch tar in the base draw all the other notes together in a sensual embrace, sending a haze of smoke and leather up through the nutty, earthy sandalwood.

Monstera Eau de Parfum,Xinu,"Monstera pays tribute to the scent of Monstera Deliciosa ('Delicious Monster'), a lush plant native to the tropical rainforests of Southern Mexico. Although Monstera produces fruit, the focus here is on the green, aromatic scent of the leaves, stem, and plant itself.
When talking about green scents, it's important to define the type of greenness â green perfumes can smell vegetal, herbaceous, bitter, dewy, bitter, or waxy depending on the notes used. What's astonishing about Monstera is just how juicy and lush the greenery smells here, like a leaf that's been snapped open, allowing great big droplets of plant juice and sap to seep out. The scent supports the crunchy greenery with an accord that smells like damp earth, bitter moss, and the sharpness of a pineapple-like note from the Monstera fruit. In its final movement, orchid and datura lend a subtly creamy white floral tone, the orchid in particular giving the scent a hint of bitter cocoa and vanilla. But in general, the aromatic greenery of a Mexican jungle is what lingers here, both in the mind and on the skin. Monstera is a leafy green scent that never once loses its focus, for a result that's both beautiful and technically impressive.","leaves fruit monstera, sacred ear flowers, white datura, bullhorn orchid",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,monstera pays tribute scent monstera deliciosa 'delicious monster' lush plant native tropical rainforests southern mexico although monstera produces fruit focus green aromatic scent leaves stem plant talking green scents important define type greenness green perfumes smell vegetal herbaceous bitter dewy bitter waxy depending notes used what's astonishing monstera juicy lush greenery smells like leaf that's snapped open allowing great big droplets plant juice sap seep scent supports crunchy greenery accord smells like damp earth bitter moss sharpness pineapple like note monstera fruit final movement orchid datura lend subtly creamy white floral tone orchid particular giving scent hint bitter cocoa vanilla general aromatic greenery mexican jungle lingers mind skin monstera leafy green scent never loses focus result that's beautiful technically impressive,"leaves fruit monstera, sacred ear flowers, white datura, bullhorn orchid"
OroNardo Eau de Parfum,Xinu,"OroNardo is a word that combines two Spanish words: nardo, which means tuberose, the famously fleshy white flower that's native to Mexico, and oro, meaning gold, hence OroNardo ('Golden Tuberose').
Being both Mexican and famous for his lyrical treatment of white florals, it is no surprise that Rodrigo Flores-Roux is able to pay proper tribute to the gorgeous Mexican tuberose. First, he flanks the tuberose with a very indolic mock orange - a sweet-smelling white flower that smells like jasmine petals dipped in honey â to accentuate its naturally fleshy sexiness. Then he draws out its green, camphoraceous freshness through judicious use of marigold, a spicy, herbaceous flower with a twinge of vegetal bitterness. The result captures the totality of the freshly-plucked flower â tuber, stems, petals, leaves and all. The texture of OroNardo is also a delight, transitioning gracefully from whipped cream to a breeze of golden, pollinated powder. Delicate and green rather than heavy, OroNardo shows that, in the right hands, tuberose doesn't have to be the show-stopping monster it's often reputed to be.","mock orange, floral notes, marigold, tuberose, white nerium oleander",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oronardo word combines two spanish words nardo means tuberose famously fleshy white flower that's native mexico oro meaning gold hence oronardo 'golden tuberose' mexican famous lyrical treatment white florals surprise rodrigo flores roux able pay proper tribute gorgeous mexican tuberose first flanks tuberose indolic mock orange sweet smelling white flower smells like jasmine petals dipped honey accentuate naturally fleshy sexiness draws green camphoraceous freshness judicious use marigold spicy herbaceous flower twinge vegetal bitterness result captures totality freshly plucked flower tuber stems petals leaves texture oronardo also delight transitioning gracefully whipped cream breeze golden pollinated powder delicate green rather heavy oronardo shows right hands tuberose show stopping monster often reputed,"mock orange, floral notes, marigold, tuberose, white nerium oleander"
Fumabat Eau de Parfum,Couteau de Poche,"Fumabat: an unusual name for unusual perfume. Parid Cefa takes familiar materials â pine, carnation, frankincense, patchouli â and rearranges them in a novel way that that you don't smell what you're expecting to smell. Expectations are upended. For example, despite the presence of mint, green tea, and galbanum in the topnotes, Fumabat is neither green nor particularly fresh.
Instead, it's a tarry spice oriental with a big old school drydown of oakmoss, patchouli, and soapy leather. Surprised that fragrances with such throwback appeal are being produced in small artist's ateliers in Brooklyn? Yeah, so are we. In a good way. For all its retro style, Fumabat feels exciting and new. We are taken on a dizzyingly ride from spicy carnation, oakmoss, and galbanum, which appear to reference classic perfumery, to exotic, smoky frankincense, which brings us straight to the sultan's harem, and even detouring briefly to a grungy, 1970's style patch. Somehow, Fumabat manages to pull everything together brilliantly, as if perfumery had always been missing a vital piece of the puzzle â Arabian Nights meets Burt Reynolds â and this brand stepped in to provide it.","green tea, galbanum, mint absolute, black pine, carnation, frankincense, vetiver root, leather, oakmoss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fumabat unusual name unusual perfume parid cefa takes familiar materials pine carnation frankincense patchouli rearranges novel way smell expecting smell expectations upended example despite presence mint green tea galbanum topnotes fumabat neither green particularly fresh instead tarry spice oriental big old school drydown oakmoss patchouli soapy leather surprised fragrances throwback appeal produced small artist's ateliers brooklyn yeah good way retro style fumabat feels exciting new taken dizzyingly ride spicy carnation oakmoss galbanum appear reference classic perfumery exotic smoky frankincense brings us straight sultan's harem even detouring briefly grungy 's style patch somehow fumabat manages pull everything together brilliantly perfumery always missing vital piece puzzle arabian nights meets burt reynolds brand stepped provide,"green tea, galbanum, mint absolute, black pine, carnation, frankincense, vetiver root, leather, oakmoss, patchouli"
Aguamadera Eau de Parfum,Xinu,"Aguamadera is an amalgamation of two words in Spanish: agua for water, and madera for wood, thus Aguamadera meaning 'waterwood'. This name makes sense when you consider that this is a scent based on the scent of agave, a tough succulent native to Mexico whose hard, spiky leaves give us both agave syrup and mezcal. The mezcal theme is fully explored in Aguamadera, with a lime note up top that's so tart it almost draws saliva from the mouth. There's a hit of salt with an outdoorsy freshness that recalls a gust of sea air. All this might be written off as just another riff on a summer freshie were it not for the incredible woody notes that form the ballast of the scent â guaiac wood gives the scent the smokey agave spirit of mezcal, and cedarwood a nuance of sweat-lodge coziness that lends enormous charm and warmth. The woods are more creamy than dry or radiant, which works exceptionally well against the spikier salt and citrus notes. If you're in the market for a tangy, citrusy fragrance with a natural, non-abrasive woody drydown that goes on forever, then Aguamadera should be on your radar.","agave, lime, guaiac wood, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,aguamadera amalgamation two words spanish agua water madera wood thus aguamadera meaning 'waterwood' name makes sense consider scent based scent agave tough succulent native mexico whose hard spiky leaves give us agave syrup mezcal mezcal theme fully explored aguamadera lime note top that's tart almost draws saliva mouth there's hit salt outdoorsy freshness recalls gust sea air might written another riff summer freshie incredible woody notes form ballast scent guaiac wood gives scent smokey agave spirit mezcal cedarwood nuance sweat lodge coziness lends enormous charm warmth woods creamy dry radiant works exceptionally well spikier salt citrus notes market tangy citrusy fragrance natural non abrasive woody drydown goes forever aguamadera radar,"agave, lime, guaiac wood, cedar"
Copala Eau de Parfum,Xinu,"Copala focuses on copal resin, used as incense by the indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America since the time of the Mayan civilization. Black copal is heavy and rich, known for its bittersweet bay leaf scent; golden copal is as smooth and sweet as honey. Here, it is the good-natured sweetness of Mexican golden copal that gives this dry, incensey vanilla its edge. The faintly cinnamon-and-bay-leaf spiciness inherent in the resin is firmly underlined by a piquant pink pepper note that runs all the way down the spine of the scent to the base. Smoky mesquite woods keep the sultry Mexican vanilla powdery and elegant - no gluttony or sugared excess here. Instead, a dark cocoa-ish tone develops, giving the woody vanilla a dustiness reminiscent of the white ash left after the copal burns clean away. What's most impressive about Copala is its lightness and naturalness: compared to most other spicy vanilla orientals, the Xinu rendition is positively monastic.","pink pepper, copal, mesquite, mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/78602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,copala focuses copal resin used incense indigenous peoples mexico central america since time mayan civilization black copal heavy rich known bittersweet bay leaf scent golden copal smooth sweet honey good natured sweetness mexican golden copal gives dry incensey vanilla edge faintly cinnamon bay leaf spiciness inherent resin firmly underlined piquant pink pepper note runs way spine scent base smoky mesquite woods keep sultry mexican vanilla powdery elegant gluttony sugared excess instead dark cocoa ish tone develops giving woody vanilla dustiness reminiscent white ash left copal burns clean away what's impressive copala lightness naturalness compared spicy vanilla orientals xinu rendition positively monastic,"pink pepper, copal, mesquite, mexican vanilla"

French Affair Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"French Affair pays tribute to the fiercely elegant chypres of Paris in the 1970's â earthy, mossy affairs worn by the free-thinkers of the world who strolled through the Left Bank like they owned it. And they did. Women in Le Smoking tuxedos unbuttoned to the navel, men in full-on Oscar Wilde mode: nonconformists who smelled of Gauloises smoke, crushed velvet, and Aramis 900. But French Affair is no nu-chypre pretender. It is authentically, damply, unmistakably oakmoss-y, with that familiar inky feel that gives chypres their backbone. A rich wave of Indonesian patchouli - earthy and camphoraceous - jumps out at you from the topnotes, riding hand in hand with the moss to create an accord of coppery, freshly-turned soil. The lychee note smells more like overripe plum, momentarily sweetening the earthier notes. Violet leaf streaks across the loamy gloom, as surprising as a camera flash. But the dark, musty earth notes are what prevail â a bolt of black velvet unfolded after many years in storage. Eventually, this accord reveals a spiced, plummy rose and a pungent cedary drydown that is both aromatic and slightly sweaty. French Affair stands shoulder to shoulder with the great patchouli chypres of the 1970's, Aramis 900, Aromatics Elixir, and Givenchy Gentleman. Close your eyes and breathe in the smell of cigarette smoke floating through velvet collars soaked in patchouli. Dark, moody, and viciously sexy, French Affair is indeed a very French Affair.","bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, cedar, angelica, pepper, patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,french affair pays tribute fiercely elegant chypres paris 's earthy mossy affairs worn free thinkers world strolled left bank like owned women le smoking tuxedos unbuttoned navel men full oscar wilde mode nonconformists smelled gauloises smoke crushed velvet aramis french affair nu chypre pretender authentically damply unmistakably oakmoss familiar inky feel gives chypres backbone rich wave indonesian patchouli earthy camphoraceous jumps topnotes riding hand hand moss create accord coppery freshly turned soil lychee note smells like overripe plum momentarily sweetening earthier notes violet leaf streaks across loamy gloom surprising camera flash dark musty earth notes prevail bolt black velvet unfolded many years storage eventually accord reveals spiced plummy rose pungent cedary drydown aromatic slightly sweaty french affair stands shoulder shoulder great patchouli chypres 's aramis aromatics elixir givenchy gentleman close eyes breathe smell cigarette smoke floating velvet collars soaked patchouli dark moody viciously sexy french affair indeed french affair,"bergamot, lychee, violet leaf, rose, cedar, angelica, pepper, patchouli, vetiver, oakmoss"

Note de Yuzu, Heeley's collaboration with the Tokyo-Parisian fashion house and music label Maison Kitsune takes the yuzu bath as the perfect point of departure to encapsulate British, French, and Japanese influences into a sparkling, soothing, sensual fragrance. Note de Yuzu opens as exuberantly as a bottle of champagne, the celebratory pop filling the air with effervescent droplets.

Dolce Amalfi Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati,"If the most breathtaking locales in the world are a combination of sheer beauty, but also of contrast and drama, then the Amalfi Coast's reputation is richly deserved. Colorfully elaborate structures are peppered throughout volcanic crags and wildflower-lined cliffs carry winding roads that overlook narrow beaches astride azure-blue Mediterranean water, where luxury super-yachts dock next to simple sailboats. It's enough to make the world's greatest writers stand in abject silence and simply appreciate how beautiful a place can be. This stunning tableau is what Casamorati set out to capture in Dolce Amalfi, a delightfully brisk, sweetly fruity, warmly balsamic new scent available for the first time outside of Xerjoff's luxury boutique in Dubai. From the first sniff, we can see why they wanted to keep it all to themselves. Juicy apple is made all the more redolent with a sophisticated spice blend, while smoothly seductive incense is warmed in the sun via a rich collection of balsamic notes and vanilla. All together, it's a cheery, fruity, sunny, yet grown-up dose of smooth relaxation, as any good testament to Amalfi should be.

Oud Stars - Malesia Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"Malesia: a biogeographical region stretching from Southern Thailand to the islands of the South Pacific, home to some of the world's most mysterious locales and exotic flora and fauna. Within its borders lie adventure, romance, riches... and danger. This is the olfactory landscape Xerjoff has set out to map, and the results are a scent that washes over us in waves of richly balsamic, fiercely animalic, and soothingly smooth floral luxury. Malesia is stunningly rich right from the opening, with the exquisite oud blend seeping even into the luscious lily of the valley top note. Complex gurjum balsam tempered with amyris-strengthened sweet amber flows through the heart, while the oud only increases in strength as the warm, musky vanilla of the base uncurls with languid confidence. When all is balanced, a glow settles atop the skin that lingers for hours and hours.

Oud Stars - Ceylon Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"While tea scents are often thought of as delicate and ethereal, there's no reason why that must be so- tea, after all, is a dynamic substance, equally capable of powerful richness and deeply spiced aromas. While soft tea scents are undeniably beautiful, why stop there? This is the beauty of Ceylon, a scent that dares to surround exquisite black tea from Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) with decadently luxurious oriental and gourmand notes, producing a sumptuous tea scent unlike any other.
Ceylon opens with a sweetly honeyed drop of bergamot, which quickly smooths the way for the tea at the center of the show- jet-black, richly toasted, and the perfect compliment to a sensually smooth blend of Malaysian oud and Indian sandalwood. As a mouthwatering vanilla and powdery amber emerge, the notes blend with astonishing balance, leaving the tea as the unifying note between sweet, creamy, powdered, woodsy and balsamic elements.

Beach Hut Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"When is a beach scent more than just a beach scent? When it's part of Amouage's stunningly inventive suite of new releases. Beach Hut Man, the newest from the Midnight Flower collection, is no mere salty aquatic- instead, as told by Creative Director Christopher Chong, it's ""the story of an iridescent aromatic idyll that unfolds in the fragrant wild garden of a beach hut.""

It means that Beach Hut Man is equal parts oceanic and intensely green, for an utterly unique and exciting new masculine that invigorates and relaxes in equal measure.

Bruma Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon,"Bruma means 'solstice' in Latin, which brings to mind something one might wear to a pagan ritual or to howl at the moon. But the word 'Bruma' is also close to the French word brume for mist, and we think that this word fits the scent better. It begins with a gentle misting of iris, violets, and peony, all swirled together into a creamy, fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum, part lipstick. A rooty iris stands at the center, quietly gathering itself up into a soft leather, aided by black pepper, which accentuates the naturally rubbery facets of peony. Thanks to a touch of lavender and galbanum, the suede or leather accord grows ashier, greener, and drier, the ghost of Tuscan Leather flickering at the edges. It is only after a while that one begins to notice the delicious creaminess of the base coming forward: damp jasmine petals pressed into spicy, milky tonka bean and the saltwater taffy of labdanum. All the while, Bruma retains a delightfully gauzy texture, which makes it an easy wear, even in hot weather. The lingering impression is of a fruity violet suede accord over dry ash, resin, and finally, the nutty, baked hay smell of tonka and vetiver. It is not the striding Valkyrie implied by the name; but for days when you want to smell just plain amazing rather than fierce, Bruma is the perfect choice.","black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55965.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bruma means 'solstice' latin brings mind something one might wear pagan ritual howl moon word 'bruma' also close french word brume mist think word fits scent better begins gentle misting iris violets peony swirled together creamy fluffy cosmetics accord that's part lokhoum part lipstick rooty iris stands center quietly gathering soft leather aided black pepper accentuates naturally rubbery facets peony thanks touch lavender galbanum suede leather accord grows ashier greener drier ghost tuscan leather flickering edges one begins notice delicious creaminess base coming forward damp jasmine petals pressed spicy milky tonka bean saltwater taffy labdanum bruma retains delightfully gauzy texture makes easy wear even hot weather lingering impression fruity violet suede accord dry ash resin finally nutty baked hay smell tonka vetiver striding valkyrie implied name days want smell plain amazing rather fierce bruma perfect choice,"black pepper, lavender, galbanum, violets, peony, iris, jasmine, labdanum, vetiver, tonka bean"
II (Deux) Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon,"II, or Deux (French for two), is all about new beginnings: the second act, rebirth, regeneration. Essentially, Deux is an aromatic scent filled to brimming with the piercingly green smell of regrowth â fig saplings, plants, and young conifers pushing their way up through layers of humus and pine needles to meet the sun. With lots of aromatic juniper and bitter orange, it is brisk and unsentimental, an impression confirmed by its salty, woody musk in the drydown. Like all the perfumes in the Cire Trudon range, it is perfectly unisex. Although not listed, we smell a lot of kitchen garden notes in here too, particularly the resinous snap of tomato leaf, mint, basil, and the milky juice of fresh fig leaf. The vibrant, stemmy smell of crushed leaves is intoxicating, bringing back memories of small, childish hands stained green with plant juice. This is a scent that crawls with life. Wearing it, you can almost sitting in a forest clearing, face turned to the sun, surrounded by the fertile smell of tender green shoots and leaves pushing up to the surface, like a fast motion sequence on a nature documentary. Deux is the perfect fragrance with which to welcome in the rites of spring and drive away the cold stoniness of winter. Bristling with verdant energy, think of Deux as a shot of antioxidant-rich green juice to stimulate the blood and re-start the engine.","green leaves, orange bigarade, pine, pepper, juniper, cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55966.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ii deux french two new beginnings second act rebirth regeneration essentially deux aromatic scent filled brimming piercingly green smell regrowth fig saplings plants young conifers pushing way layers humus pine needles meet sun lots aromatic juniper bitter orange brisk unsentimental impression confirmed salty woody musk drydown like perfumes cire trudon range perfectly unisex although listed smell lot kitchen garden notes particularly resinous snap tomato leaf mint basil milky juice fresh fig leaf vibrant stemmy smell crushed leaves intoxicating bringing back memories small childish hands stained green plant juice scent crawls life wearing almost sitting forest clearing face turned sun surrounded fertile smell tender green shoots leaves pushing surface like fast motion sequence nature documentary deux perfect fragrance welcome rites spring drive away cold stoniness winter bristling verdant energy think deux shot antioxidant rich green juice stimulate blood start engine,"green leaves, orange bigarade, pine, pepper, juniper, cedar, incense, ambroxan, cashmeran"
Mortel Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon,"Mortel proves there's a reason why incense has been burned in churches for thousands of years: it just smells darned good. Yes, incense is used to purify the air and to rid places of worship of bad spirits. But the truth of the matter is that the scent of frankincense, labdanum, myrrh, and benzoin is almost universally pleasing. The question then becomes how to build an incense fragrance in a way that it stands out from countless others in the genre. Some use room-filling synthetics to lift the resins, some are dense and airless, and some are airy, bright â almost soapy. Mortel is a bone-dry, monastic take on the theme, differing from other entries in the field by being both wearable (in a casual, everyday sense) and supremely natural in feel. It skips entirely the lime-peel brightness of the topnotes of frankincense, plunging instead directly towards a heart of dark, waxy, smoked-out resin, with a vein of sizzling black pepper. The structure stacks churchy resins around a core of extremely dry labdanum, which here completely lacks the friendlier caramelic tones of its usual presentation. Myrrh, licorice-like and earthy, is particularly prominent, its dark oiliness underlined by a generous helping of nutmeg, pimento, and pepper. The toasty tones of Virginia cedar form a bridge between the dusty cistus in the heart to the powdery benzoin in the far dry-down. But, although Mortel is undeniably dry and austere, its dryness is organic, like the natural dustiness of soot or charcoal. Calming and meditative, it is an incense that will elevate the spirit without grinding the wearer down. Believe us, that's a hard balance to strike, and in our opinion, Mortel nails it.","cedar, iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55967.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mortel proves there's reason incense burned churches thousands years smells darned good yes incense used purify air rid places worship bad spirits truth matter scent frankincense labdanum myrrh benzoin almost universally pleasing question becomes build incense fragrance way stands countless others genre use room filling synthetics lift resins dense airless airy bright almost soapy mortel bone dry monastic take theme differing entries field wearable casual everyday sense supremely natural feel skips entirely lime peel brightness topnotes frankincense plunging instead directly towards heart dark waxy smoked resin vein sizzling black pepper structure stacks churchy resins around core extremely dry labdanum completely lacks friendlier caramelic tones usual presentation myrrh licorice like earthy particularly prominent dark oiliness underlined generous helping nutmeg pimento pepper toasty tones virginia cedar form bridge dusty cistus heart powdery benzoin far dry although mortel undeniably dry austere dryness organic like natural dustiness soot charcoal calming meditative incense elevate spirit without grinding wearer believe us that's hard balance strike opinion mortel nails,"cedar, iris absolute, benzoin, myrrh, gaiac"
Olim Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon,"Olim, Latin for 'once', is supposed to evoke the excess and vanity of the French court under King Louis. And indeed, this is one pompadour of a fragrance, full of glittering powder, resin, golden bergamot, exotic spice, and intimate musks. Breathing this in, one might imagine the powdered wigs and sugary petit fours of Marie Antoinette, as well as the aromatic lavender waters splashed on by courtiers after their evening toilette. It is glittering, bold, and full-figured â an oriental with its corset stays loosened.
We begin at the afternoon tea table of the young Queen and her adoring coquettes. A golden bergamot is doused heavily in powdered sugar, turning it from tart to fizzy and sweet: a lemon sherbet in fragrance form. Aromatic herbs in the heart sparkle â dewy lavender and anise, turning the air violet as the gentlemen drench their wigs and clothes to freshen them. But there is something sensual and skin-like underneath the bright elements, a combination of creamy musk, clove, and patchouli giving the lavender and bergamot a naughty Jicky edge. The deliberate clashing of citrus and cream, aromatics and resin, well â that's the classic recipe for when you want to do an oriental right. And Olim gets it right. If you love the warm sexiness of big-boned orientals such as Shalimar, Musc Ravageur, and Opus 1144, then Olim ought to give you a thrill.","bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55968.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,olim latin 'once' supposed evoke excess vanity french court king louis indeed one pompadour fragrance full glittering powder resin golden bergamot exotic spice intimate musks breathing one might imagine powdered wigs sugary petit fours marie antoinette well aromatic lavender waters splashed courtiers evening toilette glittering bold full figured oriental corset stays loosened begin afternoon tea table young queen adoring coquettes golden bergamot doused heavily powdered sugar turning tart fizzy sweet lemon sherbet fragrance form aromatic herbs heart sparkle dewy lavender anise turning air violet gentlemen drench wigs clothes freshen something sensual skin like underneath bright elements combination creamy musk clove patchouli giving lavender bergamot naughty jicky edge deliberate clashing citrus cream aromatics resin well that's classic recipe want oriental right olim gets right love warm sexiness big boned orientals shalimar musc ravageur opus olim ought give thrill,"bergamot, lavender, anise, pink pepper, clove, patchouli, benzoin, myrrh, musk"
Revolution Eau de Parfum,Cire Trudon,"Inspired by the chaos in the streets of Paris during the French Revolution, Revolution is a fragrance full of the smells of danger â the peppery smoke of gunpowder mingling with raging fire, leather riding boots, and spilled musket oil. Such accords have the potential to come off as harsh or extreme, but in the experienced hands of British perfumer Lyn Harris, they convey the excitement of battle with a buttery smoothness that makes the scent a breeze to wear. So we have rugged, ashy leather and the sooty smoke from burned-out houses, but with a creamy elemi underpinning that immediately softens the punch. Cade oil muscles its way past the buttery leather, filling the nostrils with its intensely green-black, smoky smell. Adding to the powerful impression of chaos created by the opening, a peppery papyrus combines with dusty cedar to create a searing flash of gunpowder from a newly-spent musket. Together, these notes conjure up the image of a young soldier, taking temporary shelter in a burned-out house on the Champs-Elysees, the searing smell of soot, ash, singed leather boots, and gunpowder softened by the creamy smell of ancient cedar bookcases, sheaves of paper, and the whiff of incense from a nearby church. And it's this juxtaposition between burned and creamy elements that gives the scent its power to soothe and excite at the same time. Revolution is the smell of the vestiges of civilization meeting the approaching fires of the crusaders.","elemi, angelica, cedar, papyrus, patchouli, cade, incense, cistus, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/55969.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired chaos streets paris french revolution revolution fragrance full smells danger peppery smoke gunpowder mingling raging fire leather riding boots spilled musket oil accords potential come harsh extreme experienced hands british perfumer lyn harris convey excitement battle buttery smoothness makes scent breeze wear rugged ashy leather sooty smoke burned houses creamy elemi underpinning immediately softens punch cade oil muscles way past buttery leather filling nostrils intensely green black smoky smell adding powerful impression chaos created opening peppery papyrus combines dusty cedar create searing flash gunpowder newly spent musket together notes conjure image young soldier taking temporary shelter burned house champs elysees searing smell soot ash singed leather boots gunpowder softened creamy smell ancient cedar bookcases sheaves paper whiff incense nearby church juxtaposition burned creamy elements gives scent power soothe excite time revolution smell vestiges civilization meeting approaching fires crusaders,"elemi, angelica, cedar, papyrus, patchouli, cade, incense, cistus, opoponax"

Woman in Gold Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"The Austrian Mona Lisa glows not with an ambiguous smile, but in gorgeous golden patterns, motifs, and flushed rosy cheeks. Gustav Klimt's 1907 portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is one of the most famous of his erotic gold-leaf paintings. By Kilian's Woman In Gold conjures a similar sensuality and play between light and shadow through a delicate rose as seen through unctuous vanilla and exquisite woods. Woman in Gold glows from the onset, with a tart bergamot and ripe mandarin, blended into soft-focus by a warm vanillic tonka bean. A sweet silken rose slowly blooms, petals lifting, whipped to a velvety froth, but with a darkness within, hinted at by gentle layers of oud and patchouli, seamlessly adjoined. The result is a perfume as complex and dazzling as the woman who wears it.","bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425100.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,austrian mona lisa glows ambiguous smile gorgeous golden patterns motifs flushed rosy cheeks gustav klimt's portrait adele bloch bauer one famous erotic gold leaf paintings kilian's woman gold conjures similar sensuality play light shadow delicate rose seen unctuous vanilla exquisite woods woman gold glows onset tart bergamot ripe mandarin blended soft focus warm vanillic tonka bean sweet silken rose slowly blooms petals lifting whipped velvety froth darkness within hinted gentle layers oud patchouli seamlessly adjoined result perfume complex dazzling woman wears,"bergamot, mandarin, geranium, rose, patchouli, oud, tonka bean"
Gold Knight Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Inspired by the dashing, golden-armored chevalier in Gustav Klimt's 1902 Beethoven Frieze, By Kilian's Gold Knight flows with a similar golden opulence. The dark sensuousness of patchouli is draped in deep, golden honey, as Kilian Hennessy is wont to do. But despite the gourmand connotations, a fresh anisic bite adds an invigorating masculine edge for the Gold Knight - most distinctively paired with a bright, dry bergamot in the opening. As the scent grows darker, the honeyed patchouli shimmers with cinnamon, vanilla, and anise into a warm, sexy powerhouse.
A magnificent collector's edition coffret, beautifully embellished in homage to artist Gustav Klimt's unique signature style and masterful use of gold leaf. Once opened, the mirrored zamac lid inside reflects the luminosity, mysterious glamour, and jewel-like quality of each bottle.","bergamot, anise, patchouli, vanilla, cinnamon honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired dashing golden armored chevalier gustav klimt's beethoven frieze kilian's gold knight flows similar golden opulence dark sensuousness patchouli draped deep golden honey kilian hennessy wont despite gourmand connotations fresh anisic bite adds invigorating masculine edge gold knight distinctively paired bright dry bergamot opening scent grows darker honeyed patchouli shimmers cinnamon vanilla anise warm sexy powerhouse magnificent collector's edition coffret beautifully embellished homage artist gustav klimt's unique signature style masterful use gold leaf opened mirrored zamac lid inside reflects luminosity mysterious glamour jewel like quality bottle,"bergamot, anise, patchouli, vanilla, cinnamon honey"
Eau My Soul Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"While the internet can be a nasty, spiteful, ungenerous place (to say the very least), we're delighted to report that fragrance lovers, by and large, are the exact opposite- which explains the success of many supportive, loving private communities of perfume aficionados online, including Christi Long's Eau My Soul. To celebrate this island of positivity, 4160's Sarah McCartney offered EMS's members a rare chance- vote on their top 25 favorite notes, and she would blend them together into a magnum opus of fragrance. Lo and behold, the votes were cast, and Sarah delivered with Eau My Soul, the newest and most democratic of releases from 4160 Tuesdays.
Working primarily from sandalwood and amber, the top two vote-getters, Eau My Soul is an exuberant delight, or as Sarah herself describes it, a ""warm, friendly, inclusive group hug"" of a scent. A fresh bust of early citrus quickly warms into smooth, creamy woods and amber, giving off the delectable vibe of sparkling root beer. As lush florals blend seamlessly with musk, tobacco and honeyed leather, we can't help but think of sinking into a well-worn easy chair in our favorite pajamas, warmed by an unpretentiously casual mixed drink and a bite of our favorite dessert. We know Eau My Soul is named for the community that launched it. But even if it weren't, the name fits too well to think it could be called anything else.","bergamot, lavender, honey, frankincense, cognac, sandalwood, rose, jasmine, orris, myrrh, tobacco, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, benzoin, musk, patchouli, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64622.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,internet nasty spiteful ungenerous place say least we're delighted report fragrance lovers large exact opposite explains success many supportive loving private communities perfume aficionados online including christi long's eau soul celebrate island positivity 's sarah mccartney offered ems's members rare chance vote top favorite notes would blend together magnum opus fragrance lo behold votes cast sarah delivered eau soul newest democratic releases tuesdays working primarily sandalwood amber top two vote getters eau soul exuberant delight sarah describes warm friendly inclusive group hug scent fresh bust early citrus quickly warms smooth creamy woods amber giving delectable vibe sparkling root beer lush florals blend seamlessly musk tobacco honeyed leather can't help think sinking well worn easy chair favorite pajamas warmed unpretentiously casual mixed drink bite favorite dessert know eau soul named community launched even name fits well think could called anything else,"bergamot, lavender, honey, frankincense, cognac, sandalwood, rose, jasmine, orris, myrrh, tobacco, amber, oakmoss, vanilla, benzoin, musk, patchouli, vetiver"
Berlin Eau de Parfum,Gallivant,"It's Berlin - think carefree summers, swimming at the Strandbad Wannsee with fresh water hitting the skin. Gritty urban living in brutalist apartment blocks, concrete, elegant parquet floors. Modern bohemians in leather, smoke, spices, cups of black tea, inside and underground. A city where you can be decadent, poor-but-sexy. Berlin is a play of light and dark, opening with zingy top notes of grapefruit, clementine, and lemon, all the rinds glistening with oils. There's a zip from schinus molle â a piquant flushed fruit akin to pink pepper.

Pink Wood Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics,"Imagine the majestic web of roots beneath the ground's surface - the entwining rhizomatic structure, flowing energy deep from the earth. Tanya Bochnig, the natural perfumer of April Aromatics, has created an ode to these roots with Pink Wood, a regal blend that taps the root extracts and botanicals from plants growing close to the earth.
Pink Wood unfurls dramatically with rose, the queen of flowers as Sappho called her, making her grand entrance in grand doses, in the form of rose absolute and rose otto. The rose feels warm and generous, honeyed around the edges with tart, sweet pink fruits and buttressed by a spiced bourbon-like oakwood. A dignified oud partners with the rose, but it's never overwhelming - in fact, a beautifully aged patchouli and radiant sandalwood smooth out all the edges, as cistus and labdanum expand with earthy darkness. Above all else, this is a grounding scent, teaching us that the heart and roots are not so separate after all.","rose otto, rose absolute, geranium, pink fruits, rosewood, sandalwood, agarwood, patchouli, cistus, labdanum, oak",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,imagine majestic web roots beneath ground's surface entwining rhizomatic structure flowing energy deep earth tanya bochnig natural perfumer april aromatics created ode roots pink wood regal blend taps root extracts botanicals plants growing close earth pink wood unfurls dramatically rose queen flowers sappho called making grand entrance grand doses form rose absolute rose otto rose feels warm generous honeyed around edges tart sweet pink fruits buttressed spiced bourbon like oakwood dignified oud partners rose never overwhelming fact beautifully aged patchouli radiant sandalwood smooth edges cistus labdanum expand earthy darkness else grounding scent teaching us heart roots separate,"rose otto, rose absolute, geranium, pink fruits, rosewood, sandalwood, agarwood, patchouli, cistus, labdanum, oak"
El Cosmico Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"El Cosmico is both a difficult, and an easy, place to explain. On the one hand, it's almost impossible to succinctly describe this campground-turned-venue-turned-hotel-turned-landmark, or the remote, artists'-haven town of Marfa where it resides. On the other hand, when you're sitting around a roaring fire under the West Texas stars, it's simple to pick a single word: magical. This is at the core of David Moltz's El Cosmico, an ode to a truly remarkable place where the rustically timeless and the bleeding edge of hip coexist in beautiful harmony. Originally conceived for a 2015 performance where a proprietary olfactory instrument circulated scents throughout an outdoor crowd while his band performed, Moltz has since synthesized that experience into a single fragrance that perfectly captures the aura of the high plains desert: citric sumac plays against darkly smoky creosote and a zing of mesquite, while robustly fresh pinyon pine and oak lend a woodsy backbone. Above it all floats an enchanting, gently sparkling, and almost ozonic note- perhaps the sand accord?- that perfectly evokes the astounding glow of the stars out far beyond any city lights. Suspended between the luminous cosmos and the rugged frontier, El Cosmico is a delightful, surprising, enchanting new scent from D.S. & Durga.","sumac, creosote, pinyon pine, oak, mesquite, sand, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68627.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,el cosmico difficult easy place explain one hand almost impossible succinctly describe campground turned venue turned hotel turned landmark remote artists' town marfa resides hand sitting around roaring fire west texas stars simple pick single word magical core david moltz's el cosmico ode truly remarkable place rustically timeless bleeding edge hip coexist beautiful harmony originally conceived performance proprietary olfactory instrument circulated scents throughout outdoor crowd band performed moltz since synthesized experience single fragrance perfectly captures aura high plains desert citric sumac plays darkly smoky creosote zing mesquite robustly fresh pinyon pine oak lend woodsy backbone floats enchanting gently sparkling almost ozonic note perhaps sand accord perfectly evokes astounding glow stars far beyond city lights suspended luminous cosmos rugged frontier el cosmico delightful surprising enchanting new scent durga,"sumac, creosote, pinyon pine, oak, mesquite, sand, woods"
"O, Unknown! Eau de Parfum",Imaginary Authors,"""There is no greater joy in the world than the joy of not knowing what is to be found around the bend."" - Philip Sava.
At age 65, when famed explorer and author Philip Sava was given less than a year to live, he set off from his home in Madagascar for parts unknown. Leaving all his belongings behind, he set off on foot, hopped a freighter across the Indian Ocean, and wandered into the Bangladesh wilderness. His journey, which lasted over a decade, took him through Nepal and Tibet where his exploration turned spiritual and into rural China where months of solitude resulted in some of the most confessional observations ever committed to paper. This is the story of a man grappling with the meaning of life as he grasps to life's last vestiges.
At the risk of sounding bleak, this night could be your last. Splash on O, Unknown! and plunge forth - the black tea leaves are swirling with ambiguous meanings, imbued with a light smokiness from Lapsang Souchong. A deeply sensual combination of musk and orris add a haunting, woozy presence that unfolds on skin. Like a transformative tea reading for your spirit.","black tea, lapsang souchong tincture, orris butter, kyoto moss, musk balsam, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,greater joy world joy knowing found around bend philip sava age famed explorer author philip sava given less year live set home madagascar parts unknown leaving belongings behind set foot hopped freighter across indian ocean wandered bangladesh wilderness journey lasted decade took nepal tibet exploration turned spiritual rural china months solitude resulted confessional observations ever committed paper story man grappling meaning life grasps life's last vestiges risk sounding bleak night could last splash unknown plunge forth black tea leaves swirling ambiguous meanings imbued light smokiness lapsang souchong deeply sensual combination musk orris add haunting woozy presence unfolds skin like transformative tea reading spirit,"black tea, lapsang souchong tincture, orris butter, kyoto moss, musk balsam, sandalwood"
Ambra Extrait de Parfum,Jeroboam,"Taking on an olfactory family this well known is no small feat. It's a testament of perfumer Vanina Murraciole's originality and creativity that Ambra manages to whisk amber away from the staid and into a sensual, modern, androgynous realm. From the onset, Ambra enters a billowing vanilla, full of sweet cream and lifted up with a peppery-fresh duo of bergamot and geranium. It's fluffy, almost airy -- but there's a darkness around the edges, discreetly smoldering with patchouli and incense. Once Peru balsam kicks in, it's a veritable amber, but shape-shifting, nonetheless. Wrapped in the seductive energy of Jeroboam's enigmatic musks, with hints of of smoke in the distance, this amber on the brink of gourmand might just tip us over.","bergamot, geranium, incense, balsam, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, enigmatic musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,taking olfactory family well known small feat testament perfumer vanina murraciole's originality creativity ambra manages whisk amber away staid sensual modern androgynous realm onset ambra enters billowing vanilla full sweet cream lifted peppery fresh duo bergamot geranium fluffy almost airy there's darkness around edges discreetly smoldering patchouli incense peru balsam kicks veritable amber shape shifting nonetheless wrapped seductive energy jeroboam's enigmatic musks hints smoke distance amber brink gourmand might tip us,"bergamot, geranium, incense, balsam, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, enigmatic musk"
Cafe Tuberosa Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne,"Encountering Cafe Tuberosa is like entering a bustling coffeeshop, with that dark, bittersweet scent of freshly roasted coffee beans, grinding and pressed for a perfect cup of espresso. The mouthwatering citrus that Atelier Cologne famously perfected is present in small doses here â just enough Calabrian bergamot to whet the tongue, and a ripe, tangy Sicilian tangerine that adds a wonderful fruity quality to an otherwise deep, warm cacao. In fact, the combination of rich cacao, classic espresso, and cardamom-flecked vanilla puts Cafe Tuberosa squarely in the gourmand category. And when Atelier Cologne does gourmand, they do it with subtlety and flair, and the proof is in the pudding. For despite its name, Cafe Tuberosa contains no high-powered tuberose, and the florals here are quite relaxed â it's the vanilla espresso combo that keeps us sniffing for more. Add the faintest hint of a cigarette, dangling from a coy smile, and you've got the most easy going kind of sexy scent, ready for whatever the day might bring.","bergamot, tangerine, cardamom, tuberose, cacao absolute, rose absolute, patchouli, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51035.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,encountering cafe tuberosa like entering bustling coffeeshop dark bittersweet scent freshly roasted coffee beans grinding pressed perfect cup espresso mouthwatering citrus atelier cologne famously perfected present small doses enough calabrian bergamot whet tongue ripe tangy sicilian tangerine adds wonderful fruity quality otherwise deep warm cacao fact combination rich cacao classic espresso cardamom flecked vanilla puts cafe tuberosa squarely gourmand category atelier cologne gourmand subtlety flair proof pudding despite name cafe tuberosa contains high powered tuberose florals quite relaxed vanilla espresso combo keeps us sniffing add faintest hint cigarette dangling coy smile got easy going kind sexy scent ready whatever day might bring,"bergamot, tangerine, cardamom, tuberose, cacao absolute, rose absolute, patchouli, vanilla, musk"
My Own Private Teahupo'o Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"Teahupo'o, on the Tahitian coast- a place of unmatched beauty and untamed nature, where waves that begin as droplets of water in Antarctica gather power over thousands of miles before crashing ashore with such majestic power that the village has become perhaps the holiest- and most dangerous- site in international surfing. To commemorate this uniquely Tahitian fusion of intensity and tranquility, Carlos Kusubayashi enlisted the S-Perfume team to create My Own Private Teahupo'o, an exhilarating, intense oceanic scent with a surprisingly soothing development. Opening with a blast of salty ozone that drops us immediately onto the side of one of Teahupo'o's iconic 20-foot vertical waves, the scent instantly thrums with sensual energy. As we finally get around to catching our breath on shore, the ocean-kissed wind brings us the sweet essence of tropical flowers, while a smooth, creamy vanilla calls to mind a traditional monoi. Finally, the glow of IFF's renowned Amber Xtreme in the drydown leaves us feeling the sun on our skin long after dusk.

With such lofty inspiration as background, and the sophisticated opulence of Roja Dove in control, we were expecting great things from Elysium. Now that we've smelled its fresh, warm, confident blend of musks, fruits, leather and woods, we're delighted to confirm that it's destined to become a new masculine classic. From the opening notes, it's clear that Elysium was designed to stand out, as it features a uniquely engineered use of musk as a top note, which combines with the ultra-fresh blend of energetic citrus and aromatic lavender for a beginning as smooth as it is fresh. A juicy, sweet dose of fruit in the heart pairs perfectly with spicy woods, balancing striking liveliness with richly masculine sophistication. And in the exquisite drydown, sensual leather and soft vanilla give strength and longevity while a reprise of musk lends a dreamlike warmth that more than lives up to the ambitious name.

Suede Osmanthe Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","When Pierre Guillaume reworks a fragrance, he does so from the bottom up â if L'Eau de Circe was his fruity paeon to the peachy osmanthus, Suede Osmanthe is its dark, mysterious cousin whose true identity is in question. Osmanthus is a most bewitching flower, its elegant petals often scenting the rice fields of China with their potently smoky, fruity fragrance. In Suede Osmanthe, the delicate flower's seductive contrasts are deconstructed and magnified to gorgeous effect.
The first surprise comes in the fresh, lilting fizz of aldehydes - herbaceously floral and soapy-clean, the bubbles float and tug at the surface of a just-ripened apricot, and the fuzzy skin lets out small whiffs of the sweet fruit within. In a most natural transition, apricot skin melts into soft, cozy suede, and leathery Suederal radiates with the black tea leaves in a smoky embrace. The notes suddenly ring perfectly of a sleek osmanthus, slimmed down to its essentials. The illusion completes itself in a wave of silky musks, androgynous and mysterious. It's a chic illusion, as there's no actual osmanthus here, but as with the most beautiful sleight-of-hand, you'll fall in love anyway.","aldehydes, black tea, osmanthus, apricot, suederal, cashmeran, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34553.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,pierre guillaume reworks fragrance bottom l'eau de circe fruity paeon peachy osmanthus suede osmanthe dark mysterious cousin whose true identity question osmanthus bewitching flower elegant petals often scenting rice fields china potently smoky fruity fragrance suede osmanthe delicate flower's seductive contrasts deconstructed magnified gorgeous effect first surprise comes fresh lilting fizz aldehydes herbaceously floral soapy clean bubbles float tug surface ripened apricot fuzzy skin lets small whiffs sweet fruit within natural transition apricot skin melts soft cozy suede leathery suederal radiates black tea leaves smoky embrace notes suddenly ring perfectly sleek osmanthus slimmed essentials illusion completes wave silky musks androgynous mysterious chic illusion there's actual osmanthus beautiful sleight hand fall love anyway,"aldehydes, black tea, osmanthus, apricot, suederal, cashmeran, musk"
Patchouli Sublime Elixir de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"In keeping with the legacy of Nicolai, Patchouli Sublime elevates the most classic material used in perfumery, patchouli, and reveals its sumptuous qualities, both verdant and smooth. Patchouli Sublime's appeal is in how the exquisite blend unfolds, starting from its high-altitude crisp beginning. If we were to compare it to its predecessor, Patchouli Intense, we would call them cousins â one of the earth, one of the sky. Minty and green, a fresh lavender sets a classic stage for Patchouli Sublime, sparkling from its mountaintop. The pure, cool air, lifted with mint and coriander, introduces a dance of rosy geranium and soft, herbaceous patchouli to the scene. It's a regal pairing, and Parfums de Nicolai celebrates this time-honored union to, dare we say, sublime perfection. The patchouli never goes earthy, and instead, unfurls into a richly green, textured symphony, with the lavender in tow, all the way to the heart. The complexity and longevity of Patchouli Sublime reigns supreme, and as it melts into the skin, it's actually musky. And for once, Patchouli Sublime joins the mortal souls in their corporeal delights, and graces us with a clean yet gorgeously earthy, sensual musk.

Tubereuse Absolue pays tribute to the grand dame and the lineage of perfumery inspired by her charms. A fanfare of bright spices announces her arrival, with cardamom leading the way, and a glint of bergamot and lavender provide the spotlight. A grand tuberose, long white petals sweeping the floor, makes her radiant entrance, gracious yet coy. Her intoxicating aroma is a slow reveal here, and she keeps her indolic cards close to her chest. Handmaids jasmine and gardenia are by her side, but they know never to overshadow the star. This is a most sophisticated tuberose, not green or minty, but clean, luminous and creamy, with enough woodsy richness to steal your heart. As her luscious white petals unfold, they impart an almost suede-like buttery texture, and a base of warm cedarwood shows just how deep her beauty goes. How could we resist 'la belle dame sans merci' â the beautiful lady without mercy?","bergamot, cardamom, lavender, galbanum, tuberose, broom, jasmin sambac, gardenia, orange blossom, cedar, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70211.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tuberose tuberose say belle ball enters eyes sultry white flower one fell swoop tubereuse absolue perris monte carlo follows flower origin aztec civilization called oximochitl 'bone flower ' long white blossoms delicate waxy petals tubereuse absolue pays tribute grand dame lineage perfumery inspired charms fanfare bright spices announces arrival cardamom leading way glint bergamot lavender provide spotlight grand tuberose long white petals sweeping floor makes radiant entrance gracious yet coy intoxicating aroma slow reveal keeps indolic cards close chest handmaids jasmine gardenia side know never overshadow star sophisticated tuberose green minty clean luminous creamy enough woodsy richness steal heart luscious white petals unfold impart almost suede like buttery texture base warm cedarwood shows deep beauty goes could resist 'la belle dame sans merci' beautiful lady without mercy,"bergamot, cardamom, lavender, galbanum, tuberose, broom, jasmin sambac, gardenia, orange blossom, cedar, vetiver, musk"
Elephant Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Huge trees quake at their approach, vulnerable leaves shuddering as the ground rumbles under heavy footsteps. They come with appetites as massive as their lumbering bodies. Nothing is spared from their bottomless hunger â trees stripped bare, roots upturned, even the tiniest blooms cannot escape their grasp. When the behemoths move on, they leave behind a path of destruction. Yet what often looks like carnage is actually a renaissance. The elephants fulfill a vital role- purging the delicate ecosystem, allowing new life to flourish.
From beneath a canopy of lush, damp foliage, the complex aromas of Zoologist Elephant emerge. Into a mixture of invigorating Darjeeling and incense, swirl hints of magnolia, coconut and cocoa. With the patience of a foraging herd stripping the bark from a thicket of trees, the fragrance dissipates gradually. What is revealed is the core of the perfume - a beautiful and satisfying blend of woody notes, which dry down to an elegant, natural sandalwood scent.","tree leaves, darjeeling tea, magnolia, cocoa, coconut milk, incense, jasmine, woody notes, amber, musk, patchouli, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76016.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,huge trees quake approach vulnerable leaves shuddering ground rumbles heavy footsteps come appetites massive lumbering bodies nothing spared bottomless hunger trees stripped bare roots upturned even tiniest blooms cannot escape grasp behemoths move leave behind path destruction yet often looks like carnage actually renaissance elephants fulfill vital role purging delicate ecosystem allowing new life flourish beneath canopy lush damp foliage complex aromas zoologist elephant emerge mixture invigorating darjeeling incense swirl hints magnolia coconut cocoa patience foraging herd stripping bark thicket trees fragrance dissipates gradually revealed core perfume beautiful satisfying blend woody notes dry elegant natural sandalwood scent,"tree leaves, darjeeling tea, magnolia, cocoa, coconut milk, incense, jasmine, woody notes, amber, musk, patchouli, sandalwood"
Layton EXCLUSIF Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"When we first heard that Parfums de Marly had a new version of their cult favorite Layton, we admit we were at a bit of a loss: how could they possibly improve on the fruity, spicy, gloriously lively luxuriousness of this ode to the splendor of Versailles? Now that we have it in our hands, we're pleased to announce this is no mere flanker. Instead, perhaps inspired by Marie Antoinette's extensive remodeling of the palace and grounds in the 18th century, Marly has rebuilt Layton from the ground up, delivering a companion piece to the fresh, sporty original that surrounds the signature blend of fruits and spices with deep, animalic woods and resins for a darkly seductive experience. In Layton Exclusif, a heavy dose of civet hums through the rich floral heart, delivering a new layer of sensuality. And the already opulent vanilla and woods base is further enhanced, with resinous amber and an alluringly powerful coffee note to invigorate the senses and heighten the passion. Does Layton Exclusif take the place of our beloved Layton? It's not meant to. Instead, we think of the two as the ultimate pair- Layton, a gentleman's perfect match for a day of royal festivities, and Layton Exclusif, a dangerously seductive secret weapon when day turns to evening.","bergamot, mandarin, water accord, grapefruit, rose, geranium, waterlily, gardenia, civet, cardamom, sandalwood, gaiac, amber, pink pepper, vanilla, coffee, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70024.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first heard parfums de marly new version cult favorite layton admit bit loss could possibly improve fruity spicy gloriously lively luxuriousness ode splendor versailles hands we're pleased announce mere flanker instead perhaps inspired marie antoinette's extensive remodeling palace grounds th century marly rebuilt layton ground delivering companion piece fresh sporty original surrounds signature blend fruits spices deep animalic woods resins darkly seductive experience layton exclusif heavy dose civet hums rich floral heart delivering new layer sensuality already opulent vanilla woods base enhanced resinous amber alluringly powerful coffee note invigorate senses heighten passion layton exclusif take place beloved layton meant instead think two ultimate pair layton gentleman's perfect match day royal festivities layton exclusif dangerously seductive secret weapon day turns evening,"bergamot, mandarin, water accord, grapefruit, rose, geranium, waterlily, gardenia, civet, cardamom, sandalwood, gaiac, amber, pink pepper, vanilla, coffee, musk"
Oud Wood Intense Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"In celebration of the 10th anniversary of Oud Wood, a game-changer in its use of oud for Western perfumery, Tom Ford has come out with a confident, commanding new take with Oud Wood Intense. If you're expecting the same old song but with a different tune, you'll be pleasantly, outrageously surprised â it's no flanker here. Indeed, with the higher extrait concentration, the amped-up rugged texture is entirely its own doing, with a fresh new set of notes.
Don't undermine that word Intense â the supercharged fragrance opens with a zingy, hydrating burst of aromatics and spices with the addition of piquant cypress, juniper, and angelica root. They combine for an almost citrus-like sweet fresh energy, but always with a slightly bitter, verdant edge. Then, at the heart of Oud Wood Intense, we reach the growling, meaty heart. Layers of ginger add spice while Tom Ford's signature smooth oud sings, but don't be fooled â this is the most prominently smoky, textured oud of his yet. The castoreum contributes a wonderfully animalic dimension that adds heft and presence akin to Tuscan Leather, but even surpassing it in dark, saturated presence. One of the most exciting additions to the Tom Ford Private Blend line, Oud Wood Intense is a bold statement to add polish to any night out on the town.","angelica root, ginger, cypress, juniper, oud, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63561.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,celebration th anniversary oud wood game changer use oud western perfumery tom ford come confident commanding new take oud wood intense expecting old song different tune pleasantly outrageously surprised flanker indeed higher extrait concentration amped rugged texture entirely fresh new set notes undermine word intense supercharged fragrance opens zingy hydrating burst aromatics spices addition piquant cypress juniper angelica root combine almost citrus like sweet fresh energy always slightly bitter verdant edge heart oud wood intense reach growling meaty heart layers ginger add spice tom ford's signature smooth oud sings fooled prominently smoky textured oud yet castoreum contributes wonderfully animalic dimension adds heft presence akin tuscan leather even surpassing dark saturated presence one exciting additions tom ford private blend line oud wood intense bold statement add polish night town,"angelica root, ginger, cypress, juniper, oud, castoreum"
Patch Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville,"Patch Flash is one of the most exuberant ""Flashes"" yet. Its mouthwatering opening is shaped by a bracing whisky accord - bright and boozy, but with a rich earthiness and a touch of smoke. As it dries down, the juiciness gives way to a drier spiciness in the heart. Eventually, everything settles to a velvety, golden amber on a cool, dark patchouli - a deep viridian green.
There something achingly autumnal about the contrast of golden warmth and cool depth in Patchouli Flash. It's like that feeling on the last warm afternoon of fall, kicking through a pile of raked leaves to the damp grass and cool earth beneath. A must-sniff for patchouli fans and newcomers alike.","spices, whiskey accord, leather, patchouli, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69209.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,patch flash one exuberant flashes yet mouthwatering opening shaped bracing whisky accord bright boozy rich earthiness touch smoke dries juiciness gives way drier spiciness heart eventually everything settles velvety golden amber cool dark patchouli deep viridian green something achingly autumnal contrast golden warmth cool depth patchouli flash like feeling last warm afternoon fall kicking pile raked leaves damp grass cool earth beneath must sniff patchouli fans newcomers alike,"spices, whiskey accord, leather, patchouli, benzoin"

Opening with fresh, tranquil notes of lemon, geranium, and pink pepper, Figment then moves into a luminous heart of sandalwood that entwines dramatically with leather-inflected, smokily animalic elements evoking primal secrets and ancient traditions. As the base emerges, intoxicatingly balsamic strokes of labdanum and guaiac wed the earthly to the mystical with sublime grace. Inspired by the wondrous Kingdom of Bhutan, where the mountains meet the sky, Figment Man is an apt testament to one of the few places on earth where magic and mystery still reign.","lemon, geranium, pink pepper, sandalwood, animalic accord, vetiver, labdanum, guaiac, earth accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41886.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,new release amouage always reason celebrate fragrance unique figment arrives truly appreciate special venerable omani house rich contrast dreamlike serenity figment man draws exquisite florals woods animalics together create utterly original rapturously imaginative men's scent challenge delight equal measure opening fresh tranquil notes lemon geranium pink pepper figment moves luminous heart sandalwood entwines dramatically leather inflected smokily animalic elements evoking primal secrets ancient traditions base emerges intoxicatingly balsamic strokes labdanum guaiac wed earthly mystical sublime grace inspired wondrous kingdom bhutan mountains meet sky figment man apt testament one places earth magic mystery still reign,"lemon, geranium, pink pepper, sandalwood, animalic accord, vetiver, labdanum, guaiac, earth accord"

Sunny Side Up Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"Leave it to iconoclast Juliette Has A Gun to infuse sandalwood with exuberant new optimism, out of the darkness and into the golden sun. In a pop art flourish, the yolky marigold cap on the white bottle cheekily alludes to its name, Sunny Side Up - but worry not - it's meant as a symbol of carefree joy, and the scent is as sleek as silk on skin. In the first moment of Sunny Side Up, fresh, sweet cream of amyris and sandalwood enters the senses, and it feels like when the warm light of the afternoon sun bathes the skin. Smooth, pure, and milky, the sandalwood comes across as lovely as homemade ice cream, with delightful specks of vanilla bean, elevated with a drizzle of coconut milk. Hints of jasmine add air and lift, with thick, luxurious slabs of iris butter blended deliciously in, resulting in a never-heavy, freshly-whipped finish. Sunny Side Up charmingly glides along between the beachy, gourmand, and woodsy, without ever staying put in any one category. As the holiday in the sun winds down, layers of soft musk wrap around creamy pear-like ambrette and warm vanilla in the coziest finale.

Monsieur Beauregard Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"Our French friend' is how this unknown but over-familiar houseguest Monsieur Beauregard is typically introduced. His lingering gaze lets you know he'll take things from here. A special kind of perfection that with its strong caressing silence speaks volumes! Confidently quiet, and mysteriously sexy, Monsieur Beauregard's namesake fragrance opens with subtle vivacity, a silky burst of pink pepper, lemon, and spicy cinnamon. But this dashing young French heir never gives it all away â the veil of mystery is always there, in a creamy base of orris and enough woodsy musk to make your knees weak.

The Uncompromising Sohan Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"Ambitious, intelligent and astute, Sohan has worked diligently with flair and talent to establish himself in the world of affairs. Although he may be uncompromising in his drive, he certainly knows how to transform his business relationships into amicable ties; Lord George and Lady Blanche are always thrilled to welcome a well-traveled, worldly guest. His fragrance is that of a thoroughly unfamiliar rose â a rose with oversized thorns. A juicy, tangy rose that knows nothing of coy discretion, for it is paired with a powerful, yet refined oud that knows when to charge onward. But ever the diplomat, Sohan's oud knows how to charm and negotiate between his Middle Eastern associates and the Western palate, with the perfect amount of musky vetiver to ground the whole discussion.

The Bewitching Yasmine Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"The Bewitching Yasmine is by all appearances soft and quiet. Yet at the same time, she conducts herself with a rare force. Some, the less determined, would find her distant, maybe cold, but appearances are notoriously misleading. Like many intriguing (and bewitching) women, the perfume of Yasmine is hot and cold. The unique sharpness of rich, strong coffee is set off against a creamy spice accord, complete with aromatic cardamom. Hers is an ambition that doesn't look back, and she has the allure to match - billowing white vanilla, honeyed with hints of jasmine catch your attention. As you lean in for more, a wisp of incense floats away, with a mysterious note of Laotian oud.

She knows how to host and receive, with impeccable manners, without question. And her scent is similarly refined, reassuring â but you can't help but notice the surreptitious flame. She opens with a hit of uplifting citrus bergamot that recalls the finest Earl Grey tea. Drink deeper, and you notice the honeyed spice in the air, with red ginger and cinnamon.

Terroni Parfum,Orto Parisi,"Inspired by the molten lava that bubbles beneath the earth's surface and has shaped the once-volcanic terrain of southern Italy, Terroni is an intense, fiery fragrance for those with passion for their roots.

Vetyverio - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"The elegant balance between the fresh and earthy as achieved in Vetyverio is brought to a new, more powerful level in this Eau de Parfum concentration. The legendary percentage of Haitian vetiver (ethically sourced, no less) at 25% is again present here, but with a dynamic new presence due to the increased concentration. We were blown away by the deeper, woodsier base notes that made the vetiver feel true-to-life, along with a boosted grapefruit opening that sings effervescently and highlights vetiver's fresh, herbaceous quality. The result is an incredible ode to vetiver that is deeply naturalistic, and revels in its contrasts, both invigorating and grounding, with a bold new projection and sillage. And, it being Diptyque, there's always a playful charm - in this case, a surprising note of rose, if you can catch it.","vetiver, patchouli, grapefruit, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/483014.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,elegant balance fresh earthy achieved vetyverio brought new powerful level eau de parfum concentration legendary percentage haitian vetiver ethically sourced less present dynamic new presence due increased concentration blown away deeper woodsier base notes made vetiver feel true life along boosted grapefruit opening sings effervescently highlights vetiver's fresh herbaceous quality result incredible ode vetiver deeply naturalistic revels contrasts invigorating grounding bold new projection sillage diptyque there's always playful charm case surprising note rose catch,"vetiver, patchouli, grapefruit, rose"
Aventus For Her Eau de Parfum,Creed,"Aventus for Her marks the irresistible feminine counterpart to the legendary Aventus. Nearly three years in the making, this olfactory celebration of femme forte was highly anticipated before its triumphant unveiling by The House of Creed.

Baccarat Rouge 540 Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"In the Fall of 2014, Baccarat, the most prestigious and opulent crystalworks in the world, celebrated the 250th anniversary of their founding by releasing an extraordinary crystal decanter containing a luminous, exclusive fragrance created by Francis Kurkdjian. Released later onto the open market in a slightly more achievable presentation as Baccarat Rouge 540 EDP, the world quickly fell in love with the gorgeously woody floral-amber and its equal parts transparent, dense, and intense character. Now, Baccarat and M. Kurkdjian extend their partnership with a new Extrait concentration that intensifies the power and radiance of all aspects of the scent, all without betraying the original inspiration.
MFK describes Rouge 540 not in terms of top, heart and base notes, but rather as the interplay between three unique accords, each lending a distinct and visceral characteristic. The ""breeze"" accord, jasmine and saffron, sits sheer and delicately spiced on the skin, leading way for the cedar-driven blend of woods that make up the robust and crackling ""heat"" accord. Finally, a ""mineral"" accord of ambergris seems simultaneously warm and cool, delivering deceptively straightforward depth to mimic the sophistication of Baccarat Crystal itself. Each accord is given new strength in Extrait form, harmonizing above the skin with a stunning new power and intensity. Like a crystalline kaleidoscope, the Extrait opens brighter, fruitier, and shinier, and, we've found, lasts long into the wild night. Furthermore, for the first time, the scent dons a dazzling red bottle that echoes the iconic Baccarat red, giving a bold yet classic new look to Francis Kurkdjian's greatest achievement yet.","jasmine grandiflorum, saffron, bitter almond, cedar, musky wood, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49873.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fall baccarat prestigious opulent crystalworks world celebrated th anniversary founding releasing extraordinary crystal decanter containing luminous exclusive fragrance created francis kurkdjian released later onto open market slightly achievable presentation baccarat rouge edp world quickly fell love gorgeously woody floral amber equal parts transparent dense intense character baccarat kurkdjian extend partnership new extrait concentration intensifies power radiance aspects scent without betraying original inspiration mfk describes rouge terms top heart base notes rather interplay three unique accords lending distinct visceral characteristic breeze accord jasmine saffron sits sheer delicately spiced skin leading way cedar driven blend woods make robust crackling heat accord finally mineral accord ambergris seems simultaneously warm cool delivering deceptively straightforward depth mimic sophistication baccarat crystal accord given new strength extrait form harmonizing skin stunning new power intensity like crystalline kaleidoscope extrait opens brighter fruitier shinier we've found lasts long wild night furthermore first time scent dons dazzling red bottle echoes iconic baccarat red giving bold yet classic new look francis kurkdjian's greatest achievement yet,"jasmine grandiflorum, saffron, bitter almond, cedar, musky wood, ambergris"
Histoire D'Orangers Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"This newest offering from L'Artisan Parfumeur is a radiant tribute to the perfumer Marie Salagmagne's travels in the valley of Souss, at the foothills of the Anti-Atlas in Morocco. Remembering the sunset atop the earth walls of the Taroudant, the warm light intensifying the colors of the raw land, she remarks, 'Each time I think of this majestic landscape, I think of orange tree flower water. A delicate and delicious water, ultra-refreshing and incredibly luminous.'
Histoires D'Orangers is truly a story of oranges sublimated into a most delicate and pure flower water. From its sparkling white tea and verdant neroli beginning, to the gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed in glistening mineral ambroxan, it is a gentle, exquisite fragrance, through and through. There's much to revel in, when the subtleties are revealed - whether it's the musk that achieves a triple-milled purity that's never overtly soapy, or the light almond-like hint of tonka beans â the end result is like a feeling more than anything â like silk on skin, warmed by the sun.","neroli, orange blossom, white tea, musk, tonka bean, ambroxan",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,newest offering l'artisan parfumeur radiant tribute perfumer marie salagmagne's travels valley souss foothills anti atlas morocco remembering sunset atop earth walls taroudant warm light intensifying colors raw land remarks 'each time think majestic landscape think orange tree flower water delicate delicious water ultra refreshing incredibly luminous ' histoires d'orangers truly story oranges sublimated delicate pure flower water sparkling white tea verdant neroli beginning gorgeously evocative orange blossom fluffed glistening mineral ambroxan gentle exquisite fragrance there's much revel subtleties revealed whether musk achieves triple milled purity that's never overtly soapy light almond like hint tonka beans end result like feeling anything like silk skin warmed sun,"neroli, orange blossom, white tea, musk, tonka bean, ambroxan"
Au Bord De L'Eau Eau de Cologne,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Inspired by the signature work of Claude Monet, Au Bord de l'Eau uses raw olfactive materials as if they were paint pigments. Contours are suggested, not defined, in the watery waves.
Like Monet's masterpiece, we alternate between the realism of the zest of bergamot and lemon - its freshness is mixed with the petals of the bitter orange - and the more complex texture nestled below. The mist of sparkling citrus rests on the green and woody undertones of rosemary, violet, and soft musk. A cologne painted in pointillism.","bergamot, lemon, violet, musk, orange blossom, rosemary",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152020.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired signature work claude monet au bord de l'eau uses raw olfactive materials paint pigments contours suggested defined watery waves like monet's masterpiece alternate realism zest bergamot lemon freshness mixed petals bitter orange complex texture nestled mist sparkling citrus rests green woody undertones rosemary violet soft musk cologne painted pointillism,"bergamot, lemon, violet, musk, orange blossom, rosemary"
Scarlet Lily Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue,"Warm and voluptuous, Scarlet Lily is Shay & Blue's gorgeous new take on the deep red flower. This is a heady bouquet, its light, airy beginning accentuated with lotus blossoms creating a dewy mist. But when we get to the heart, it's all undulating lilies - creamy, waxy, and regal. The petals of the scarlet Adriadne lily flutter in the air, never too indolic or heavy, with an intriguing hint of woodsy spice from a touch of ylang-ylang. In many ways, Scarlet Lily is a feat in subtle textures, finally melting into the skin in a gorgeous, gentle amber finish. Like the most benevolent seduction in a twilight bloom.","lotus blossom, scarlet ariadne lily, ylang-ylang, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70417.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,warm voluptuous scarlet lily shay blue's gorgeous new take deep red flower heady bouquet light airy beginning accentuated lotus blossoms creating dewy mist get heart undulating lilies creamy waxy regal petals scarlet adriadne lily flutter air never indolic heavy intriguing hint woodsy spice touch ylang ylang many ways scarlet lily feat subtle textures finally melting skin gorgeous gentle amber finish like benevolent seduction twilight bloom,"lotus blossom, scarlet ariadne lily, ylang-ylang, amber"
Delina Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"Composed by Guerlain-trained perfumer Quentin Bisch, Delina is a floral bouquet, a fragrant tribute to feminity and sensuality. Housed in a gorgeously soft pink bottle with pink tassels to boot, the polished, delicate character is apparent from the beginning.

The Cora Eau de Parfum,Thameen,"The Cora Sun-Drop Diamond, discovered in 2010 in South Africa, is the largest yellow pear-shaped diamond in the world, weighing in at an astounding 110.3 carats. Distinguished by its gorgeously vivid yellow hue, the result of nitrogen trapped in the carbon molecules while it was forming billions of years ago, the diamond sold to an anonymous bidder for almost $11 million. While the otherworldly beauty of the Cora Sun-Drop is sadly no longer for sale, Thameen has given us the next best thing, a stunning floral amber that radiates both bright excitement and luxurious elegance. The Cora opens with a sparkling flash of white jasmine and magnolia, shining against sweet wisteria and luscious yellow Bulgarian rose. Like the perfectly cut edge of a worthy stone, a precisely applied dash of nutmeg contrasts with a generous swoon of carnation and lily and a rich ribbon of creamy vanilla that swirls with resinous notes to make a delectable amber.

Mandala Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"Mandala is an old Sanskrit word for circle that, in Hinduism and Tibetan Buddhism, has come to mean a feeling of completeness. When Tibetan monks make a mandala offering, they are offering up the universe in a microcosm to Buddha. Thus it follows that Mandala, the fragrance, offers up the gift of every precious material that monks possess to the Gods âÂ frankincense, myrrh, ambergris, and precious spices. The scent opens with the dark, coca cola effervescence of ebony woods, frankincense, and myrrh, immediately flooding the soul with a sense of reverence and peace. At once exotic and atmospheric, one can almost feel cool stone at one's back and hear the low chant of the monks. But despite the rich density of resin and spice, the scent feels weightless and airy. The peppery incense floats over a cool, soapy canopy of cardamom and angelica, which parts to reveal not a church ceiling but the open night sky. A trace of saline moss and ambergris in the base steadies the resins and spices, fixing them in a verdant earthiness that feels solid, grounded. Mandala is Eastern Zen in a bottle.","nutmeg, angelica, olibanum (frankincense), cardamom, cinnamon, clove, labdanum, cedar, myrrh, sandalwood, oakmoss, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64008.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mandala old sanskrit word circle hinduism tibetan buddhism come mean feeling completeness tibetan monks make mandala offering offering universe microcosm buddha thus follows mandala fragrance offers gift every precious material monks possess gods frankincense myrrh ambergris precious spices scent opens dark coca cola effervescence ebony woods frankincense myrrh immediately flooding soul sense reverence peace exotic atmospheric one almost feel cool stone one's back hear low chant monks despite rich density resin spice scent feels weightless airy peppery incense floats cool soapy canopy cardamom angelica parts reveal church ceiling open night sky trace saline moss ambergris base steadies resins spices fixing verdant earthiness feels solid grounded mandala eastern zen bottle,"nutmeg, angelica, olibanum (frankincense), cardamom, cinnamon, clove, labdanum, cedar, myrrh, sandalwood, oakmoss, ambergris"
Qatar Extrait de parfum,Roja Parfums,"Roja Dove's tribute to Qatar focuses on ambergris, one of the rarest materials on earth, and presents it in all its luxurious richness. The fragrance opens with sumptuous waves of sweet, salty, musky, caramel ambergris infused with toffee'd labdanum, praline-scented benzoin, and creamy vanilla. As if to mimic Qatar's famous islands, Roja Dove then dots the golden ambered waters with a complex mix of the gourmand and the oriental: roses drenched in sweet peach, jammy patchouli, fiery saffron, delectable candy floss, plush orris, and a panoply of soft, creamy woods.

Nuit de Bakelite Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir,"Alluring. That's the simplest way to describe Naomi Goodsir's latest masterpiece, Nuit de Bakelite, an otherworldly, intensely green interpretation of tuberose that's anything but simple. Drawing upon tuberose's most narcotic facets, perfumer Isabelle Doyen has crafted a stunningly bright, tantalizingly aromatic scent that ignites the senses and redefines what a floral fragrance can be. Nuit de Bakelite wastes no time announcing itself, as the very first sniff explodes with a nose-tingling burst of herbaceous angelica and bitter-green galbanum, softened with the earthy smoothness of violet leaf and an exquisite orris that recalls Naomi's equally wonderful Iris Cendre. This spiky-yet-soft dynamic is the perfect showcase for the rich tuberose heart- in Doyen's hands; the ""queen of the night"" is rich, lush and spicy, evoking a visceral carnality but never tilting too far into heavy, indolic territory. As it dries, a chorus of resinous notes and spiced tobacco draw out a vibrant portrait of floral leather, sensuous and still thrillingly green. We've always known that tuberose was among the most spectacular notes in perfumery, but even we had no idea just how beautifully original it still can seem-- until we experienced Nuit de Bakelite. We strongly suggest you do the same.","angelica, violet leaf, galbanum, orris, karo karounde, tuberose, leather, davana, styrax, tobacco, labdanum, gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59305.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,alluring that's simplest way describe naomi goodsir's latest masterpiece nuit de bakelite otherworldly intensely green interpretation tuberose that's anything simple drawing upon tuberose's narcotic facets perfumer isabelle doyen crafted stunningly bright tantalizingly aromatic scent ignites senses redefines floral fragrance nuit de bakelite wastes time announcing first sniff explodes nose tingling burst herbaceous angelica bitter green galbanum softened earthy smoothness violet leaf exquisite orris recalls naomi's equally wonderful iris cendre spiky yet soft dynamic perfect showcase rich tuberose heart doyen's hands queen night rich lush spicy evoking visceral carnality never tilting far heavy indolic territory dries chorus resinous notes spiced tobacco draw vibrant portrait floral leather sensuous still thrillingly green we've always known tuberose among spectacular notes perfumery even idea beautifully original still seem experienced nuit de bakelite strongly suggest,"angelica, violet leaf, galbanum, orris, karo karounde, tuberose, leather, davana, styrax, tobacco, labdanum, gaiac wood"

Midnight Special Eau de Parfum,Ex Nihilo,"In the enchanting world of traditional Arabian perfumery, a mukhallat is a perfume created from a blend of pure fragrance oils, perfected over centuries but still open to the creator's personal touch. With Midnight Special, Olivier Pescheux transposes the mukhallat to a more Parisian format- the eau de parfum- keeping the focus on exceptional natural materials, but re-imagining it as a nocturnal elixir, with traditional elements of oud, rose, patchouli and spice given a cosmopolitan twist with a unique accord of rose jelly. The results are dynamic- dark, sensually smoky oud and luscious florals shine through, but the mouthwatering jelly accord, with its strong grapefruit facets, invigorates and energizes the heart notes, making an ancient formula feel vitally youthful. And a deep, rich and evocative base of oud and smooth, balanced vanilla lasts for untold hours, ensuring that the wearer will be turning heads well into the morning.

Suede de Suede Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"A soft and supple suede scent that caresses the senses. Inspired by in-house perfumer Fredrik Dalman's memories of Sweden, this is a rich, but gentle, blend of wood, leather and musk, with delicate grace notes of flowers and berries. Dalman's vision began with a pair of gloves â suede worn to the point of silkiness, lined with fur â but this scent also reminds us of a fluffy eiderdown comforter on a winter night, providing perfect warmth without heaviness. The musk at the heart of this scent is the ideal balance of clean and sensuous â with the delicate sweetness of osmanthus highlighting the innocent aspects and deep cedarwood and earthy patchouli amplifying the less-innocent ones. Although cloudberry sounds like something that might grow on a magical island, it is a real fruit that grows in Scandinavia â an amber berry with a distinctive tart taste â and it provides an exquisite, cool airiness that counters the warm and creamy suede. Initially sultry, Suede de Suede softens to become deliciously cozy and inviting.","cloudberry, sichuan pepper, suede accord, cedarwood, osmanthus, strawberry leaf, castoreum, patchouli, precious musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51728.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,soft supple suede scent caresses senses inspired house perfumer fredrik dalman's memories sweden rich gentle blend wood leather musk delicate grace notes flowers berries dalman's vision began pair gloves suede worn point silkiness lined fur scent also reminds us fluffy eiderdown comforter winter night providing perfect warmth without heaviness musk heart scent ideal balance clean sensuous delicate sweetness osmanthus highlighting innocent aspects deep cedarwood earthy patchouli amplifying less innocent ones although cloudberry sounds like something might grow magical island real fruit grows scandinavia amber berry distinctive tart taste provides exquisite cool airiness counters warm creamy suede initially sultry suede de suede softens become deliciously cozy inviting,"cloudberry, sichuan pepper, suede accord, cedarwood, osmanthus, strawberry leaf, castoreum, patchouli, precious musk"
Dojima Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Dojima opens with a delicious almond-like sweetness, which is intriguingly countered by a crisp and aromatic clary sage, setting the stage for a truly unusual scent. Tranquil and unique, Dojima is named for the Dojima Rice Exchange founded by Samurai in 1697, in Osaka, Japan and is a meditation on the perfect beauty of a grain of rice. A rice accord gives this fragrance its intriguing, hard-to- place quality â the subtle, milky warmth of steamed white rice is an undercurrent to a soothing cloud of rice powder laced with jasmine and orris. The deep sweetness of amber with a dash of nutmeg provides a rich and mellow base. An unexpected blend of edible and powdery notes that is both mysterious and comforting. A recipe to soothe the soul.","rice accord, nutmeg absolute, ambrette, jasmine, orris, clary sage absolute, labdanum co2, sandalwood, precious musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51729.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dojima opens delicious almond like sweetness intriguingly countered crisp aromatic clary sage setting stage truly unusual scent tranquil unique dojima named dojima rice exchange founded samurai osaka japan meditation perfect beauty grain rice rice accord gives fragrance intriguing hard place quality subtle milky warmth steamed white rice undercurrent soothing cloud rice powder laced jasmine orris deep sweetness amber dash nutmeg provides rich mellow base unexpected blend edible powdery notes mysterious comforting recipe soothe soul,"rice accord, nutmeg absolute, ambrette, jasmine, orris, clary sage absolute, labdanum co2, sandalwood, precious musk"
Vitrum Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco,"Vitrum is a simple but striking fragrance that showcases vetiver, its main star, in all its complex facets. This is a dramatically dark, top-quality vetiver that is gorgeously smoky, and laced with peaty, woody, mossy, earthy, and even salty fresh accents underneath. Cool, meditative incense is intertwined within, while touches of black pepper, crisp bergamot, and delicate, soft pink roses dance in the background. The notes shimmer around you, radiating different nuances in a way that lends an air of mystery and excitement to its star note.

Bond-T Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco,"Patchouli and chocolate lovers rejoice, because Bond-T will blow your mind with its mouthwatering, dark twist on the gourmand oriental category. Inspired by a visit to a top Italian chocolatier, Sammarco takes the richest black chocolate cake, slathers it in thick layers over a spicy, earthy, and woody patchouli, and then elevates everything to the next level by adding cognac liqueur, sweet plummy fruits, smoky tobacco, smooth leather, and a touch of expresso. It's a head-turning scent that left us drooling from the first sniff, but the rest of the scent is equally delectable. The luscious darkness eventually turns into a soft golden dream of boozy patchouli enveloped in creamy vanilla and comforting amber. Bond-T is a must-try for patchouli lovers as well as fans of Serge Lutens' Borneo, Roja Dove's Enigma, Roja Dove's Amber Extrait, and dark chocolate fragrances.","cocoa, patchouli, castoreum, tonka, vanilla, osmanthus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,patchouli chocolate lovers rejoice bond blow mind mouthwatering dark twist gourmand oriental category inspired visit top italian chocolatier sammarco takes richest black chocolate cake slathers thick layers spicy earthy woody patchouli elevates everything next level adding cognac liqueur sweet plummy fruits smoky tobacco smooth leather touch expresso head turning scent left us drooling first sniff rest scent equally delectable luscious darkness eventually turns soft golden dream boozy patchouli enveloped creamy vanilla comforting amber bond must try patchouli lovers well fans serge lutens' borneo roja dove's enigma roja dove's amber extrait dark chocolate fragrances,"cocoa, patchouli, castoreum, tonka, vanilla, osmanthus"
Naias Extrait de Parfum,Sammarco,"Sammarco plays once more with classical and modern perfume styles in this beautifully original, playful fruity floral that caught our attention from the very first sniff with a bright, explosively tart, lip-smacking green apple note. It's lightly sweetened with pear juice and neroli, then poured over jammy red roses, violets, green violet leaf, and a vintage-style accord of lightly powdered iris and lipstick-smelling orris. The vintage elements slowly give way to a very modern darkness, thanks to smoky osmanthus leather that's been coated in amber resins, layered with buttery sandalwood, and licked by a touch of animalic muskiness. As it develops further, Naias turns into a chameleon, its soft notes weaving and dancing in the air, frequently changing, sometimes rippling out as a fruity floral leather, sometimes as a creamy irisy woody musk with amber, abstract flowers, tangy fruits, and powder woven in. It eventually finishes as a cashmere soft mix of caramel-scented amber, plush woods, and powdered sweetness. We love Naias for its seamless layering of contrasting elements and its effortless mix of genres-- but it's also a lot of fun and easy to wear-- we bet you'll enjoy Naias as much as we do!","violet, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, neroli, iris, sandalwood, apple, pear, cassis, mandarin, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77804.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sammarco plays classical modern perfume styles beautifully original playful fruity floral caught attention first sniff bright explosively tart lip smacking green apple note lightly sweetened pear juice neroli poured jammy red roses violets green violet leaf vintage style accord lightly powdered iris lipstick smelling orris vintage elements slowly give way modern darkness thanks smoky osmanthus leather that's coated amber resins layered buttery sandalwood licked touch animalic muskiness develops naias turns chameleon soft notes weaving dancing air frequently changing sometimes rippling fruity floral leather sometimes creamy irisy woody musk amber abstract flowers tangy fruits powder woven eventually finishes cashmere soft mix caramel scented amber plush woods powdered sweetness love naias seamless layering contrasting elements effortless mix genres also lot fun easy wear bet enjoy naias much,"violet, rose, jasmine, osmanthus, neroli, iris, sandalwood, apple, pear, cassis, mandarin, amber"
Osmanthus Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Osmanthus is beautiful 365 days a year. But there's no denying that it really comes into its own in the summer heat, when it wears like the crispest white linen summer dress you've ever had the pleasure of putting on. Opening with a lively duo of bitter, greenish citrus and artemisia, the fragrance immediately establishes itself as a very clean, peppery, and invigorating citrusy floral. The osmanthus is there, half-hidden in the rustle of green muguet and leaves, but it is not overly ripe or fruity, instead emitting only delicate wisps of leathery apricot skin. The gently bitter citrus and herbs carry through to the heart, where the osmanthus melts into a radiant white jasmine, creating a gauzy, diaphanous floral effect akin to a flurry of moist petals settling on the surface of green water. And although the base gives us a bit of ambery woods for structure, the overall feel here is of a lively, cheerful floral brimming with pepper and citrus. But don't mistake freshness for banality! As flinty and delicious as a glass of chilled Sancerre, Osmanthus shows us just how intoxicating crisp, clean flowers can be when handled by the right hands.","pomelo, artemisia, red pepper, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine sambac, cedar, labdanum resin, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,osmanthus beautiful days year there's denying really comes summer heat wears like crispest white linen summer dress ever pleasure putting opening lively duo bitter greenish citrus artemisia fragrance immediately establishes clean peppery invigorating citrusy floral osmanthus half hidden rustle green muguet leaves overly ripe fruity instead emitting delicate wisps leathery apricot skin gently bitter citrus herbs carry heart osmanthus melts radiant white jasmine creating gauzy diaphanous floral effect akin flurry moist petals settling surface green water although base gives us bit ambery woods structure overall feel lively cheerful floral brimming pepper citrus mistake freshness banality flinty delicious glass chilled sancerre osmanthus shows us intoxicating crisp clean flowers handled right hands,"pomelo, artemisia, red pepper, osmanthus, water lily, jasmine sambac, cedar, labdanum resin, vetiver, musk"
Ta'if Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Ta'if roses have to hustle to survive in a hostile growing environment, high up on the plains of a rocky region near Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Mirroring its harsh environment, the Ta'if rose yields oil that is almost as extreme in its biting greenness and peppery spiciness. To complement its obstinate and proud character, Linda Pilkington chose to surround the rose with an array of exciting ArabianâÂflavors', such as saffron and dates - the saffron adding a mysterious, iodine-like touch of leather, the dates adding a juicy sweetness that gives the texture a satisfying, toffee-like chew. Ta'if is simply breathtaking. At first sharp and spicy with pepper, the rose note soon emerges in all its pushy, exotic beauty, like a Ta'if rose itself erupting through the rocky, arid soil of the Mecca plains. Later dusted heavily with bitter saffron and softened with a soapy freesia, the rose relaxes into a comfortable, peachy tone that is as unexpected as it is joyful. Orange blossom and dates add a fudgy sweetness that nudges the rose towards a Persian sweetmeat, giving the fragrance a jellied lokhoum feel. Ta'if is never thick or leaden in its exotic sweetness, however, because little wafts of gorse bush-like broom cut through the ambered heft of the base to provide lift and air. A pleasure to wear and smell, Ta'if is a gust of authentic desert air, full of spicy rose, orange blossom, and honeyed Arabian treats. Try it and be transported to another world.","saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ta'if roses hustle survive hostile growing environment high plains rocky region near mecca saudi arabia mirroring harsh environment ta'if rose yields oil almost extreme biting greenness peppery spiciness complement obstinate proud character linda pilkington chose surround rose array exciting arabian flavors' saffron dates saffron adding mysterious iodine like touch leather dates adding juicy sweetness gives texture satisfying toffee like chew ta'if simply breathtaking first sharp spicy pepper rose note soon emerges pushy exotic beauty like ta'if rose erupting rocky arid soil mecca plains later dusted heavily bitter saffron softened soapy freesia rose relaxes comfortable peachy tone unexpected joyful orange blossom dates add fudgy sweetness nudges rose towards persian sweetmeat giving fragrance jellied lokhoum feel ta'if never thick leaden exotic sweetness however little wafts gorse bush like broom cut ambered heft base provide lift air pleasure wear smell ta'if gust authentic desert air full spicy rose orange blossom honeyed arabian treats try transported another world,"saffron, dates, pink pepper, freesia, ta'if rose, jasmine, orange blossom, broom, amber"
Tolu Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Tolu is that rare animal in perfumery: an oriental that won't have you gasping for air or reaching for an insulin pen. The reason it succeeds â and succeeds so gloriously â is because of its confident balance between the warmly resinous and the briskly herbal. Fresh, green clary sage and juniper berry infuse the creamy-sweet amber with gusts of air straight from the deepest pine forest. Orange blossom adds a thickly honeyed feel to the resin, but this is balanced immediately by a crisp muguet that illuminates everything with its cool, watery greenness. Tart frankincense and roses weave through the creamy, chocolatey tonka bean foundation, aerating it and making it a treat that satisfies completely but will never weigh you down. It would be remiss of us not to mention Tolu's incredible versatility. Its plush, velvety depth make it perfectly suited to a night out in Paris or the opera; but its sunny warmth also lends itself most affably to snuggling with a loved one, or taking a long walk on cool Fall days, kicking over the amber-colored leaves. Tolu is the type of fragrance whose delicious-but-not-filling sweetness invites you to bury your nose in your coat collars and scarves to sniff out its lingering trail of gorgeousness.","juniper berry, orange blossom, clary sage, orchid, rose, muguet (lily of the valley), tolu balsam, tonka bean, golden frankincense, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tolu rare animal perfumery oriental gasping air reaching insulin pen reason succeeds succeeds gloriously confident balance warmly resinous briskly herbal fresh green clary sage juniper berry infuse creamy sweet amber gusts air straight deepest pine forest orange blossom adds thickly honeyed feel resin balanced immediately crisp muguet illuminates everything cool watery greenness tart frankincense roses weave creamy chocolatey tonka bean foundation aerating making treat satisfies completely never weigh would remiss us mention tolu's incredible versatility plush velvety depth make perfectly suited night paris opera sunny warmth also lends affably snuggling loved one taking long walk cool fall days kicking amber colored leaves tolu type fragrance whose delicious filling sweetness invites bury nose coat collars scarves sniff lingering trail gorgeousness,"juniper berry, orange blossom, clary sage, orchid, rose, muguet (lily valley), tolu balsam, tonka bean, golden frankincense, amber"
Montabaco - Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Inspired by the rugged exoticism of the Argentinean plains, Montabaco is a towering crescendo of rich tobacco, leather, tea, suede, and wood notes, each nuance overlapping the last so that an almost 3D picture of a cowboy appears, smoking a cigarette over a dwindling fire after a long, hard day corralling cattle. All this on top of a bed of airy florals puffed out with Iso E Super and Hedione for a bright, silvery-woody radiance perfectly equipped to carry the heft of the leather on its shoulders.
A fresh, balmy clary sage note dominates at first, like a nosegay of fresh green herbs tucked under the flap of a saddle, giving the fragrance an attractively lived-in air. Although the radiant florals certainly perform a role, Montabaco is not really a floral fragrance: it is the tough, smoky woods, moss, and leather accords that dominate here. But the fresh, dancing lightness of the tea leaf and white jasmine infuse the scent with enough air and space for the heavier notes to breathe. The result? A genuinely masculine 'Gaucho' type of fragrance pitched halfway between the grimy, well-worn leather of experience and the smoky, herbal airiness of the Argentinean outback. The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats.","air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77715.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired rugged exoticism argentinean plains montabaco towering crescendo rich tobacco leather tea suede wood notes nuance overlapping last almost picture cowboy appears smoking cigarette dwindling fire long hard day corralling cattle top bed airy florals puffed iso e super hedione bright silvery woody radiance perfectly equipped carry heft leather shoulders fresh balmy clary sage note dominates first like nosegay fresh green herbs tucked flap saddle giving fragrance attractively lived air although radiant florals certainly perform role montabaco really floral fragrance tough smoky woods moss leather accords dominate fresh dancing lightness tea leaf white jasmine infuse scent enough air space heavier notes breathe result genuinely masculine 'gaucho' type fragrance pitched halfway grimy well worn leather experience smoky herbal airiness argentinean outback fragrances four corners collection available pure parfum intensivo concentrations intensivo stronger two formats,"air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris"

The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats.","air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired rugged exoticism argentinean plains montabaco towering crescendo rich tobacco leather tea suede wood notes nuance overlapping last almost picture cowboy appears smoking cigarette dwindling fire long hard day corralling cattle top bed airy florals puffed iso e super hedione bright silvery woody radiance perfectly equipped carry heft leather shoulders fresh balmy clary sage note dominates first like nosegay fresh green herbs tucked flap saddle giving fragrance attractively lived air although radiant florals certainly perform role montabaco really floral fragrance tough smoky woods moss leather accords dominate fresh dancing lightness tea leaf white jasmine infuse scent enough air space heavier notes breathe result genuinely masculine 'gaucho' type fragrance pitched halfway grimy well worn leather experience smoky herbal airiness argentinean outback fragrances four corners collection available pure parfum intensivo concentrations intensivo stronger two formats,"air note, orange absolute, bergamot, juniper, clary sage, cardamom, magnolia, hedione, rose, violet, tea notes, tobacco leaf, iso e super, suede, sandalwood, moss, tonka, ambergris"
Nawab of Oudh - Intensivo,Ormonde Jayne,"Nawab of Oudh is, essentially, the spirit of a traditional Indian attar wrapped up in the format of a Western spray fragrance. Think a mass of jammy rose petals, fermented magnolia blossoms, and pandan leaf over a warm, spicy amber mercifully free of any vanilla that might weigh it down. The traditional Indian attar tends towards the lean and spicy rather than sweet or fatty, and this is a style carried through very faithfully to Nawab of Oudh. For those afraid of oud, don't worry â in Nawab of Oudh, the oud note is there only to gild the other accords with a hint of something animalic, in much the same way as civet was used in classic French perfumery. The main body of this beautiful, majestic fragrance is that warm, salt leather amber wrapped around intensely fragrant rose petals, orange peel, and magnolia, with just a hint of the nobly-rotting wood of oud peeking through the slats every now and then. Richly braided and embroidered in the Indian tradition, Nawab of Oudh will make you feel like, well, a Nawab.","green notes, bergamot, orange absolute, cardamom, aldehyde, rose, magnolia, orchid, pimento, bay, cinnamon, hedione, ambergris, musk, vetiver, labdanum, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77718.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nawab oudh essentially spirit traditional indian attar wrapped format western spray fragrance think mass jammy rose petals fermented magnolia blossoms pandan leaf warm spicy amber mercifully free vanilla might weigh traditional indian attar tends towards lean spicy rather sweet fatty style carried faithfully nawab oudh afraid oud worry nawab oudh oud note gild accords hint something animalic much way civet used classic french perfumery main body beautiful majestic fragrance warm salt leather amber wrapped around intensely fragrant rose petals orange peel magnolia hint nobly rotting wood oud peeking slats every richly braided embroidered indian tradition nawab oudh make feel like well nawab,"green notes, bergamot, orange absolute, cardamom, aldehyde, rose, magnolia, orchid, pimento, bay, cinnamon, hedione, ambergris, musk, vetiver, labdanum, oud"
Qi - Intensivo,Ormonde Jayne,"Inspired by the Chinese symbol Qi (pronounced 'Chi'), meaning 'breath of life', Ormonde Jayne's QI is a tribute to the aesthetic taste for delicacy that permeates Chinese culture from top to toe. Never intended to be a showy or dramatic fragrance, Qi instead reads as a light breeze carried from a cultivated Japanese garden, warmed through with hints of clean, tea-like florals and silky osmanthus petals. Qi opens with the balmy bite of neroli and lemon blossom, a delicately fresh precursor to a heart full of osmanthus, which laces the scent with a juicy, apricot-like aroma as well as the lightly tannic scent of green tea leaves. For a while, the scent floats peacefully along in this faintly peppered and fruited tea vein until a soft, mossy musk blurs the edges of the scent. Traversing all the minute stops between a fruity osmanthus oolong to a dry, green mate, Qi is simply a must try for tea lovers, or indeed for anyone who values translucence and refinement above all.
The fragrances in the Four Corners collection are available in both pure parfum and intensivo concentrations, with the intensivo being the stronger of the two formats.","green lemon blossom, neroli, freesia, tea notes, osmanthus, violet, hedione, rose, mate, benzoin, musk, moss, myrrh",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77722.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired chinese symbol qi pronounced 'chi' meaning 'breath life' ormonde jayne's qi tribute aesthetic taste delicacy permeates chinese culture top toe never intended showy dramatic fragrance qi instead reads light breeze carried cultivated japanese garden warmed hints clean tea like florals silky osmanthus petals qi opens balmy bite neroli lemon blossom delicately fresh precursor heart full osmanthus laces scent juicy apricot like aroma well lightly tannic scent green tea leaves scent floats peacefully along faintly peppered fruited tea vein soft mossy musk blurs edges scent traversing minute stops fruity osmanthus oolong dry green mate qi simply must try tea lovers indeed anyone values translucence refinement fragrances four corners collection available pure parfum intensivo concentrations intensivo stronger two formats,"green lemon blossom, neroli, freesia, tea notes, osmanthus, violet, hedione, rose, mate, benzoin, musk, moss, myrrh"
Ambre Royal Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Ambre Royal is a resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer is amplified in the base by the hot, salty rasp of ambergris. To wear it is to feel dipped in liquid gold and then rolled in fleurs de sel, the floral salt winnowed from the marshes of Brittany. Sappy green herbs and juicy orange announce the house signature, their peppery brightness sending a shaft of light through the structure, cheerfully prepping the way for the resins and flowers that follow. Behind the sparkle of the opening act, the soft creaminess of flowers beckons - a heart full of rosy, creamy orchid and the delicately leathery apricot of Chinese osmanthus. But caressed constantly by sweet, resinous amber and that woody-salty ambergris, the vibe is never overtly floral. The flowers exist mainly to fleck the molten red-gold warmth of the amber with little daubs of watery, dewy freshness, and ensure that the structure retains its luminous weightlessness. In the base, a duo of earthy, chocolatey patchouli and sweet, creamy tonka provide a dark contrast to the shimmering brightness of the top. A sophisticated, and yes, regal amber, it is the salty floral breeze running through Ambre Royal that positions it far away from the rough and tumble of the souk.","green notes, orange absolute, bergamot, jasmine, orchid, osmanthus, rose, amber, orris, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77701.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambre royal resinous floral oriental whose golden shimmer amplified base hot salty rasp ambergris wear feel dipped liquid gold rolled fleurs de sel floral salt winnowed marshes brittany sappy green herbs juicy orange announce house signature peppery brightness sending shaft light structure cheerfully prepping way resins flowers follow behind sparkle opening act soft creaminess flowers beckons heart full rosy creamy orchid delicately leathery apricot chinese osmanthus caressed constantly sweet resinous amber woody salty ambergris vibe never overtly floral flowers exist mainly fleck molten red gold warmth amber little daubs watery dewy freshness ensure structure retains luminous weightlessness base duo earthy chocolatey patchouli sweet creamy tonka provide dark contrast shimmering brightness top sophisticated yes regal amber salty floral breeze running ambre royal positions far away rough tumble souk,"green notes, orange absolute, bergamot, jasmine, orchid, osmanthus, rose, amber, orris, cedar, ambroxan, tonka, patchouli, musk"
Champaca Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Centered on a green tea accord with a squeeze of zesty lemon, Champaca is as squeaky clean as a freshly-scrubbed face. It is especially good in hot weather, when the papery coolness of the neroli, bamboo, and green tea steps forward to soothe ruffled tempers and restore internal peace. Stirred into this frosty glass of ice tea is a scant teaspoon's worth of basmati rice: subtle but present, it provides just enough cloudy milkiness to take the sting out of the green tea.
Champaca is unusual in that it's a floral fragrance that doesn't smell too much of flowers, let alone the titular one. There is a hint of peppery freesia, but it comes across more as clean linen than a flower. Likewise, there is a lot of waxy, yellow champaca blossom here, but only really perceptible as a burst of something lemony and creamy, like magnolia with an undertow of dusky honey. The flowers simply melt into the basmati rice accord to form a subtly peppery creaminess that relieves the sharp, tannic twang of the green tea and citruses. There is something ineffably charming about Champaca â it is rather hard to pin down, but its pearlized, milky freshness gives it all the delicacy of the inside of a conch shell. As sensual as clean skin, we highly recommend Champaca as a soft, slightly milky floral oriental that will enchant in even the hottest of weather.","neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,centered green tea accord squeeze zesty lemon champaca squeaky clean freshly scrubbed face especially good hot weather papery coolness neroli bamboo green tea steps forward soothe ruffled tempers restore internal peace stirred frosty glass ice tea scant teaspoon's worth basmati rice subtle present provides enough cloudy milkiness take sting green tea champaca unusual floral fragrance smell much flowers let alone titular one hint peppery freesia comes across clean linen flower likewise lot waxy yellow champaca blossom really perceptible burst something lemony creamy like magnolia undertow dusky honey flowers simply melt basmati rice accord form subtly peppery creaminess relieves sharp tannic twang green tea citruses something ineffably charming champaca rather hard pin pearlized milky freshness gives delicacy inside conch shell sensual clean skin highly recommend champaca soft slightly milky floral oriental enchant even hottest weather,"neroli, pink pepper, bamboo, champaca absolute, basmati rice, freesia, musk, green tea"
Frangipani Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Frangipani is testament to Linda Pilkington's exquisite taste, because instead of the cream-sodden tropicalia you might be expecting based on the name, Frangipani filters the brightly gaudy flower through a very European sensibility. In other words, no sun umbrellas or leis here. The scent itself opens with a bright squeeze of lime, before quickly sliding into a very true-to-life linden blossom, whose aroma of honey, creamed rice, and green powder forms a logical bridge to the central character of the show - the frangipani. The frangipani note here is so wonderful that it's been allowed to shine unfettered by too many other notes. The flower itself has a gently milky, nutty tiare-like scent that later tips over into the full-fat, salted butter of tuberose. But in its first blush, the frangipani displays a rosy peach facet that moistens the heart and gives it a gentle fruitiness. When the frangipani melts into the magnolia, plum, and orchid notes, it forms a blurred, chocolatey floralcy that feels as soft and inviting as the fuzz on a baby's cheek. A resinous, woody base keep the creaminess of the florals in check, ensuring that while Frangipani retains its balmy and exotic character, it never crosses the line into loudness. A beautiful scent for those who want to dip a tentative toe into tropical waters.","linden blossom, magnolia, lime, frangipani, rose, tuberose, water lily, plum, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,frangipani testament linda pilkington's exquisite taste instead cream sodden tropicalia might expecting based name frangipani filters brightly gaudy flower european sensibility words sun umbrellas leis scent opens bright squeeze lime quickly sliding true life linden blossom whose aroma honey creamed rice green powder forms logical bridge central character show frangipani frangipani note wonderful allowed shine unfettered many notes flower gently milky nutty tiare like scent later tips full fat salted butter tuberose first blush frangipani displays rosy peach facet moistens heart gives gentle fruitiness frangipani melts magnolia plum orchid notes forms blurred chocolatey floralcy feels soft inviting fuzz baby's cheek resinous woody base keep creaminess florals check ensuring frangipani retains balmy exotic character never crosses line loudness beautiful scent want dip tentative toe tropical waters,"linden blossom, magnolia, lime, frangipani, rose, tuberose, water lily, plum, amber, musk, cedar, vanilla"
Isfarkand Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Isfarkand is a mysterious thing. Its structure is simple and relatively linear â peppery citruses over grassy vetiver and radiant woods â but it transmits such a laid-back, uncluttered appeal that you'll find yourself wondering if there's more to it than meets the eye. Ormonde Jayne's signature opening notes of pink pepper and citrus burn even brighter than normal here, giving the scent the exciting zestiness of a freshly-peeled lime. The peppery spice hugs the toasty cedar and vetiver tightly, the result being a close-knit melange of clean woods, citrus, grass, and spice that is so pleasurable to wear that it doesn't really make sense to try and pick it apart.
Isfarkand is as easy to wear as a favorite shirt, so don't be surprised if you find yourself reaching for it, again and again, even over fragrances that you think you like better. It sounds simple - and it is - but somehow a certain Ormonde Jayne magic ties it all together, making it one of the classiest and most versatile everyday options for the modern man. As a subtle, my-skin-but-better woody vetiver for all seasons, Isfarkand is hard to beat.","lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,isfarkand mysterious thing structure simple relatively linear peppery citruses grassy vetiver radiant woods transmits laid back uncluttered appeal find wondering there's meets eye ormonde jayne's signature opening notes pink pepper citrus burn even brighter normal giving scent exciting zestiness freshly peeled lime peppery spice hugs toasty cedar vetiver tightly result close knit melange clean woods citrus grass spice pleasurable wear really make sense try pick apart isfarkand easy wear favorite shirt surprised find reaching even fragrances think like better sounds simple somehow certain ormonde jayne magic ties together making one classiest versatile everyday options modern man subtle skin better woody vetiver seasons isfarkand hard beat,"lime, mandarin orange, bergamot, pink pepper, cedar, iris, vetiver, oakmoss"
Ormonde Man Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Ormonde Jayne Man takes the bracing coniferous freshness of Ormonde Jayne Woman, and spins it in a slightly different direction, peppering the topnotes with a sparkling lemon and juniper pairing, and giving the basic structure a drier, cleaner feel, with plenty of cedar and agarwood in the drydown for muscle. Juniper, coriander, and a clever use of cardamom up front give the opening a turbo-blast of luridly green, almost fruity spice that propels the scent forwards, as if tied to a jetpack. Although different in feel and texture to Ormonde Jayne Woman, Ormonde Man retains all of its sister scent's mysterious, witchy atmosphere. Imagine losing your way in a thick pine forest in winter; it is dark and cold, but oddly, you feel at complete peace. All around you, the trees exhale their sweet essence of conifer and pine sap, and you breathe it in gladly, knowing that it is both cleansing and nourishing. The oud wood is dry and medicinal, but merged with the sandalwood, cedar, spice, and musk, it becomes less spice route and more traditional Chinese health potion. The drydown is a sheer wash of pinewood and pepper, a watercolor print of the powerful first half that nonetheless works as the perfect fragrance for a gentleman who favors class over volume.","juniper berry, bergamot, pink pepper, cardamom, coriander, agarwood, black hemlock, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ormonde jayne man takes bracing coniferous freshness ormonde jayne woman spins slightly different direction peppering topnotes sparkling lemon juniper pairing giving basic structure drier cleaner feel plenty cedar agarwood drydown muscle juniper coriander clever use cardamom front give opening turbo blast luridly green almost fruity spice propels scent forwards tied jetpack although different feel texture ormonde jayne woman ormonde man retains sister scent's mysterious witchy atmosphere imagine losing way thick pine forest winter dark cold oddly feel complete peace around trees exhale sweet essence conifer pine sap breathe gladly knowing cleansing nourishing oud wood dry medicinal merged sandalwood cedar spice musk becomes less spice route traditional chinese health potion drydown sheer wash pinewood pepper watercolor print powerful first half nonetheless works perfect fragrance gentleman favors class volume,"juniper berry, bergamot, pink pepper, cardamom, coriander, agarwood, black hemlock, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood, musk"
Ormonde Woman Eau de Parfum,Ormonde Jayne,"Ormonde Jayne Woman is one of those fragrances that are almost impossible to describe using the listed notes, because it only makes sense when explained as an atmosphere or a feeling. For example, we might be able to tell you that this scent contains cardamom, coriander, and the witchy-sounding black hemlock, but we're at a loss as to explain how or why the sum of this simple list of materials is a whole forest from The Brothers Grimm, complete with Hansel and Gretel, and Baba Yaga waiting in her smoky gingerbread house. And yet, it truly is.
First, a forest's worth of pungent green herbs and grasses is unfurled beneath your feet, the dark shadows of poison ivy and European oaks swallowing up all the natural daylight at the edges. This velveteen, viridian carpet is dotted with moist, sweet little violets and jasmine petals, their frilly innocence incongruous against the sinister background of forest woods. Ormonde Jayne Woman is a deeply coniferous scent with a fair amount of bitterness, but what really tugs at the heartstrings is its errant thread of sweetness - that smoky, spicy amber note that weaves through the perfume like a siren call to tempt children and adults alike. One of the rare perfumes that truly deserves its reputation asâÂmysterious', we defy you to wear this and not be shaken and stirred.","cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ormonde jayne woman one fragrances almost impossible describe using listed notes makes sense explained atmosphere feeling example might able tell scent contains cardamom coriander witchy sounding black hemlock we're loss explain sum simple list materials whole forest brothers grimm complete hansel gretel baba yaga waiting smoky gingerbread house yet truly first forest's worth pungent green herbs grasses unfurled beneath feet dark shadows poison ivy european oaks swallowing natural daylight edges velveteen viridian carpet dotted moist sweet little violets jasmine petals frilly innocence incongruous sinister background forest woods ormonde jayne woman deeply coniferous scent fair amount bitterness really tugs heartstrings errant thread sweetness smoky spicy amber note weaves perfume like siren call tempt children adults alike one rare perfumes truly deserves reputation mysterious' defy wear shaken stirred,"cardamom, coriander, grass oil, black hemlock, violet, jasmine, vetiver, cedar, amber, sandalwood"
Santo Incienso Extrait de Parfum,The Different Company,"Originally released as Le15, a one-time limited offering to celebrate The Different Company's 15-year anniversary of distinguished creations, Santo Incensio â Sillage Sacre is exactly the same formulation released under a new name for a new life. Described as 'A sacred perfume that draws its secret from shamanic stances, like a prayer to the sky', it showcases the supreme holy wood rarely used in perfumery, palo santo.
The opening spark is a bright flame, both tart and smoky, invoking the beginning of ritual. Fizzy orbs of bergamot and petitgrain crackle with delicate shavings of nutmeg, fragrant and spicy. At the same time, a vetiver-infused plume of smoke rises, and palo santo makes its entrance. This is the sacred wood elevated to high chic, a far cry from rustic bundles of wood - more like a glowing, elegant veil with meditative grounding. Here, the enchanting, contradictory facets of palo santo are deftly highlighted â the citric effervescence, piney cool, and minty lightness. A supporting note of balsamic Atlas cedar adds to the creamy-yet-shimmering wood. A wood that releases its healing, cleansing scent when burned, it is unlike any other, with pale smoke tendrils rising in subtle shades of incense and myrrh. As this soothing scent develops, you can really feel the mastery of Alexandra Monet, who's devised a way to approximate the feel of a holy incense that burns to clean white ash - leaving just a wisp of sacred smoke on the skin. Mystical, yet contemporary and wholly fresh.","bergamot, petitgrain, nutmeg, palo santo, cedar, hedione, incense, myrrh, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25342.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,originally released le one time limited offering celebrate different company's year anniversary distinguished creations santo incensio sillage sacre exactly formulation released new name new life described 'a sacred perfume draws secret shamanic stances like prayer sky' showcases supreme holy wood rarely used perfumery palo santo opening spark bright flame tart smoky invoking beginning ritual fizzy orbs bergamot petitgrain crackle delicate shavings nutmeg fragrant spicy time vetiver infused plume smoke rises palo santo makes entrance sacred wood elevated high chic far cry rustic bundles wood like glowing elegant veil meditative grounding enchanting contradictory facets palo santo deftly highlighted citric effervescence piney cool minty lightness supporting note balsamic atlas cedar adds creamy yet shimmering wood wood releases healing cleansing scent burned unlike pale smoke tendrils rising subtle shades incense myrrh soothing scent develops really feel mastery alexandra monet who's devised way approximate feel holy incense burns clean white ash leaving wisp sacred smoke skin mystical yet contemporary wholly fresh,"bergamot, petitgrain, nutmeg, palo santo, cedar, hedione, incense, myrrh, musk"
Dragonfly Eau de Parfum,Zoologist,"Drifting through swaying reeds and billowing stalks of papyrus, a breeze gives chase to a sweet morning mist. A perfect mirror, revealed upon still green water, is shattered by a sudden shower, casting the gentle romance of lotus and iris into a frenzied, passionate rhythm. High above, tendrils of sunlight nudge away the grey clouds, their warmth drawing dense aromas from the dewy surfaces below. Beneath the dwindling ripples, restless nymphs stir and begin to emerge. Under the soft moonlight, the newly-hatched dragonflies spread fragile, virgin wings, poised to explore the world between pool and sky.
Like a glade captured in delicate strokes upon an impressionist canvas, the rich, green floral medley of Zoologist Dragonfly transports you through a maze of moody tones and melancholy weather. This olfactory journey echoes the cycle of a cobalt pond, from the crackling light of dawn to the thick blanket of nightfall, under the gaze of the flitting dragonfly.","aldehydes, heliotrope, lemon, peony, rainwater, cherry blossom, clover, iris, lotus, rice, amber, moss, musk, papyrus, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76015.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,drifting swaying reeds billowing stalks papyrus breeze gives chase sweet morning mist perfect mirror revealed upon still green water shattered sudden shower casting gentle romance lotus iris frenzied passionate rhythm high tendrils sunlight nudge away grey clouds warmth drawing dense aromas dewy surfaces beneath dwindling ripples restless nymphs stir begin emerge soft moonlight newly hatched dragonflies spread fragile virgin wings poised explore world pool sky like glade captured delicate strokes upon impressionist canvas rich green floral medley zoologist dragonfly transports maze moody tones melancholy weather olfactory journey echoes cycle cobalt pond crackling light dawn thick blanket nightfall gaze flitting dragonfly,"aldehydes, heliotrope, lemon, peony, rainwater, cherry blossom, clover, iris, lotus, rice, amber, moss, musk, papyrus, sandalwood"
United Arab Emirates Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums,"United Arab Emirates Spirit Of The Union, or UAE Aoud for short, is Roja Dove's love letter to the people of the Middle East who joyfully douse themselves in the richest and most luxurious of fragrances. For a sensualist such as Roja Dove, these are his spirit animals â men unafraid to wear the richest and creamiest of rose fragrances, and women who proudly wore the most animalic of ouds. UAE Aoud pays tribute to this taste for exuberance and luxury by loading up on the most sumptuous raw materials in the world â the costliest Taifi rose ottos, the smokiest, most refined Laotian oud, and the finest floral absolutes and concretes available this side of Grasse. Supported by a creamy melange of white and yellow flowers such as jasmine, gardenia, and ylang, a bright, pure Taifi rose sings out, clearly the top-billing soprano. The leathery, animalic oud note is sharpened by an undercurrent of civet, but buried deep enough in a cloud of benzoin and spices to soften its impact. The roses, white flowers, and creamy civet come together over a dense, smoky layer of resins, woods, and oud, creating a shimmering, sensual halo of a scent.","artemisia, bergamot, black currant, cloves, geranium, jasmine, rose, taif rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, benzoin, labdanum, civet, guaiac wood, incense, musk, oakmoss, patchouli, pink pepper",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74819.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,united arab emirates spirit union uae aoud short roja dove's love letter people middle east joyfully douse richest luxurious fragrances sensualist roja dove spirit animals men unafraid wear richest creamiest rose fragrances women proudly wore animalic ouds uae aoud pays tribute taste exuberance luxury loading sumptuous raw materials world costliest taifi rose ottos smokiest refined laotian oud finest floral absolutes concretes available side grasse supported creamy melange white yellow flowers jasmine gardenia ylang bright pure taifi rose sings clearly top billing soprano leathery animalic oud note sharpened undercurrent civet buried deep enough cloud benzoin spices soften impact roses white flowers creamy civet come together dense smoky layer resins woods oud creating shimmering sensual halo scent,"artemisia, bergamot, black currant, cloves, geranium, jasmine, rose, taif rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, benzoin, labdanum, civet, guaiac wood, incense, musk, oakmoss, patchouli, pink pepper"
La Douceur de Siam Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"A perfume of strange, nocturnal beauty, La Douceur de Siam is like walking into a Thai spice garden overhung with night-blooming flowers. Creamy, dreamy, what could have been another pretty, classically composed white floral is sparked by vivid green notes and given a voluptuous exoticism with ylang-ylang, frangipani and champaca. La Douceur de Siam opens with a hothouse smell of stemmy greenery and a thorny rose so sharp you'd swear it had fangs. But soon, warm sandalwood arrives along with a soothing hint of vanilla to blanket the composition, and the rose becomes lush and welcoming. But the heart of La Douceur de Siam is the heady champaca flower â a cousin to gardenia with a suggestion of lime blossom and gentle spice. Douceur's champaca is hypnotically beautiful, languorous, suspended between peachy frangipani and dense, ripe ylang-ylang. As the notes develop and intertwine, the white flowers, rose and champaca harmonize on a bed of velvety clove and dry amber. The silken thread tying together spicy, fresh and silky notes in perfect harmony shows once again creator Pissara Umavijani 's ability to introduce unexpected elements into classically composed genres. Hypnotically lovely, La Douceur de Siam is like half-waking from an enchanting dream.","may rose, frangipani, champaca flower, clove, ylang-ylang, violet leaf, sandalwood, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,perfume strange nocturnal beauty la douceur de siam like walking thai spice garden overhung night blooming flowers creamy dreamy could another pretty classically composed white floral sparked vivid green notes given voluptuous exoticism ylang ylang frangipani champaca la douceur de siam opens hothouse smell stemmy greenery thorny rose sharp swear fangs soon warm sandalwood arrives along soothing hint vanilla blanket composition rose becomes lush welcoming heart la douceur de siam heady champaca flower cousin gardenia suggestion lime blossom gentle spice douceur's champaca hypnotically beautiful languorous suspended peachy frangipani dense ripe ylang ylang notes develop intertwine white flowers rose champaca harmonize bed velvety clove dry amber silken thread tying together spicy fresh silky notes perfect harmony shows creator pissara umavijani 's ability introduce unexpected elements classically composed genres hypnotically lovely la douceur de siam like half waking enchanting dream,"may rose, frangipani, champaca flower, clove, ylang-ylang, violet leaf, sandalwood, vanilla, amber"
Le Sillage Blanc Eau de Parfum,Dusita,"Inspired by Piguet's Bandit, Sillage Blanc is a modern chypre with a retro soul. This is Bandit with better manners and an independent streak of its own. With its bright herbal opening, Sillage Blanc is a chypre-leather riff, fresh, alternately crisp and mossy. Bandit's sharp greenness and fierce leather are there, but the rough edges have been smoothed out. Where Bandit is an emerald-eyed dominatrix cracking a horsewhip, Sillage Blanc is an urban garconne sporting a Kelly leather bag.
Sillage Blanc opens with smack of bright green galbanum sharp as a nip-waisted suit. But soapy-sweet neroli soon tones down the galbanum bite, and orange blossom adds a touch of creamy florals. Sillage Blanc is not, however, simply Bandit's more genteel sibling. Little Sis has a naughty side of her own. A green, moist tobacco note adds an earthy, illicit quality. The bitter herbal notes are distinctive, amped up with artemisia and a vegetal ambrette before settling down on a mossy, woodsy bed. Completely unisex, Sillage Blanc is like a well-made Campari cocktail held by a gloved hand â bitter, leathery perfection.","orange blossom, neroli, tobacco, artemisia, galbanum, leather, ambrette seed, patchouli, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired piguet's bandit sillage blanc modern chypre retro soul bandit better manners independent streak bright herbal opening sillage blanc chypre leather riff fresh alternately crisp mossy bandit's sharp greenness fierce leather rough edges smoothed bandit emerald eyed dominatrix cracking horsewhip sillage blanc urban garconne sporting kelly leather bag sillage blanc opens smack bright green galbanum sharp nip waisted suit soapy sweet neroli soon tones galbanum bite orange blossom adds touch creamy florals sillage blanc however simply bandit's genteel sibling little sis naughty side green moist tobacco note adds earthy illicit quality bitter herbal notes distinctive amped artemisia vegetal ambrette settling mossy woodsy bed completely unisex sillage blanc like well made campari cocktail held gloved hand bitter leathery perfection,"orange blossom, neroli, tobacco, artemisia, galbanum, leather, ambrette seed, patchouli, oakmoss"

Your night begins with a swoon of rich, vibrant fruits, lent a darker, sexier edge with a refined heart of cedarwood and geranium.

Santal Complet Eau de Parfum,Fragrance du Bois,"Tantalizingly tropical yet softly sensual, Santal Complet is a gorgeous new sandalwood scent that proves that Fragrance du Bois can do far more than just oud scents. In fact, by emphasizing the smooth, creamy, indulgent side of sandalwood with coconut, musk and vanilla, Santal Complet is a world away from the house's previous offerings, one that has us dreaming of white sand beaches and undisturbed crystal clear turquoise waters at the edge of the world.
Santal Complet opens with the aforementioned coconut note, one of the best we've ever smelled: the perfect balance between refreshing and creamy, with a zingy patina of fresh lemon and black pepper. As the beautiful, multifaceted sandalwood warms up, we find it's the perfect companion for the coconut- gently sweet, creamy, and a blend of warm and cool tonalities that feel exactly like the afternoon sun hitting your still-wet-from-the-ocean-skin, with supporting notes of amber and vanilla supplementing without overwhelming.

Hacivat Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Move over, because there's a new masculine in town, and guys, you're going to love this one. With tart, sparkling citrus draped over a backbone crisp with forest woods, oakmoss, and white jasmine, Hacivat recalls the oakmoss-laden glory of woody chypres like Pour Monsieur that once populated men's perfumery. Despite the solidly classical lines of the scent, Hacivat feels entirely modern, with a juicy pineapple note aerating the damp mosses and woods, and a touch of blackcurrant leaf keeping the tone fresh and outdoorsy. Don't be afraid of that pineapple note. Rich and natural-smelling rather than sporty or cheap, the pineapple note is so well done here that it redeems the reputation of the much-maligned fruit. Hacivat wears on the skin as lightly as a white linen shirt in summer. It is discreet, professional, and sparklingly clean, but possessed of just enough bitter moss and woods for gravitas. A rare, classically-built woody chypre with a contemporary edge, Hacivat just smells really wonderful and will make other people think you smell great too. Bookmark this scent if you love a modern classic.","bergamot, pineapple, grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli, cedar, woody notes, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77418.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,move there's new masculine town guys going love one tart sparkling citrus draped backbone crisp forest woods oakmoss white jasmine hacivat recalls oakmoss laden glory woody chypres like pour monsieur populated men's perfumery despite solidly classical lines scent hacivat feels entirely modern juicy pineapple note aerating damp mosses woods touch blackcurrant leaf keeping tone fresh outdoorsy afraid pineapple note rich natural smelling rather sporty cheap pineapple note well done redeems reputation much maligned fruit hacivat wears skin lightly white linen shirt summer discreet professional sparklingly clean possessed enough bitter moss woods gravitas rare classically built woody chypre contemporary edge hacivat smells really wonderful make people think smell great bookmark scent love modern classic,"bergamot, pineapple, grapefruit, jasmine, patchouli, cedar, woody notes, oakmoss"
Karagoz Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Meaning 'black eye', this fragrance is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays, Karagoz, who plays the traditional, hearty peasant to Hacivat's educated statesman character. Despite Hacivat's constant efforts to civilize Karagoz, he remains joyfully honest, straightforward, and witty. Karagoz, the fragrance, is as pleasantly down-to-earth as the character it emulates. Although it features the same pineapple as in Hacivat, Karagoz's treatment of it couldn't be more different. Where Hacivat is dark, crisp, and elegant, Karagoz is hearty and rustic, with a rich array of harvest fruits, herbs, and sunburned grass notes framing the juicy tartness of the pineapple. It is at once fresh and outdoorsy, but also waxily sweet with hay and amber. Despite the rude cornucopia of harvest notes, though, Karagoz turns out to be very modern in feel, thanks to the dry, quasi-industrial oud note in the base that drapes the scent in a rich, metallic shimmer. Like the shadow play character, Karagoz has a booming, fleshed-out presence that's very difficult to ignore. Wear it on a night out and see how attention it garners.","pineapple, grapes, herbal notes, neroli, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, oud, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77419.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,meaning 'black eye' fragrance tribute fragrance form one stock characters ottoman empire shadow plays karagoz plays traditional hearty peasant hacivat's educated statesman character despite hacivat's constant efforts civilize karagoz remains joyfully honest straightforward witty karagoz fragrance pleasantly earth character emulates although features pineapple hacivat karagoz's treatment different hacivat dark crisp elegant karagoz hearty rustic rich array harvest fruits herbs sunburned grass notes framing juicy tartness pineapple fresh outdoorsy also waxily sweet hay amber despite rude cornucopia harvest notes though karagoz turns modern feel thanks dry quasi industrial oud note base drapes scent rich metallic shimmer like shadow play character karagoz booming fleshed presence that's difficult ignore wear night see attention garners,"pineapple, grapes, herbal notes, neroli, jasmine, patchouli, vetiver, oud, amber"
Zenne Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Zenne is a tribute in fragrance form to one of the stock characters in Ottoman Empire shadow plays â a woman whose voluptuous beauty is capable of bringing men to their knees. And Zenne the fragrance is every bit as self-confident, flirtatious, and pretty as the character it emulates. Think of the softest, rosiest blackcurrant musk you can imagine, glazed with milky musk and turned into a cloud of pink marshmallows, and that is Zenne.
It begins in the palace garden, with a volley of pink grapefruit, rhubarb, and blackcurrant leaf, tart with morning dew. It is innocent, yet juicy and seductive. Slowly, piquant blackcurrants begin to pop against a cloudy backdrop of milky sandalwood, musk, and gardenia, staining the cream with purple juice. In the midst of all this, a rich Turkish rose ripens, slicking the tart, starchy berries and rhubarb with rose syrup, and adding body and thickness to the scent. A nugget of salty, chewy ambergris in the base extends the golden glow of the scent, giving it the sexy insolence for which the character of Zenne is known. Zenne is both innocent and come-hither â whipped up into a gentle pink froth of tart berries, creamy musks, and rich red roses, it presents an appeal that's hard to resist.","grapefruit, blackcurrant (cassis), rhubarb, rose, gardenia, sandalwood, vanilla, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77420.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,zenne tribute fragrance form one stock characters ottoman empire shadow plays woman whose voluptuous beauty capable bringing men knees zenne fragrance every bit self confident flirtatious pretty character emulates think softest rosiest blackcurrant musk imagine glazed milky musk turned cloud pink marshmallows zenne begins palace garden volley pink grapefruit rhubarb blackcurrant leaf tart morning dew innocent yet juicy seductive slowly piquant blackcurrants begin pop cloudy backdrop milky sandalwood musk gardenia staining cream purple juice midst rich turkish rose ripens slicking tart starchy berries rhubarb rose syrup adding body thickness scent nugget salty chewy ambergris base extends golden glow scent giving sexy insolence character zenne known zenne innocent come hither whipped gentle pink froth tart berries creamy musks rich red roses presents appeal that's hard resist,"grapefruit, blackcurrant (cassis), rhubarb, rose, gardenia, sandalwood, vanilla, ambergris, musk"
Hundred Silent Ways Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Inspired by a line in a poem by Rumi, the 13th century Sufi poet ""I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways"", Hundred Silent Ways communicates love wordlessly through a series of little flourishes of fruit and flowers as tender as the skin of a loved one. There is an undeniably girlish flirtatiousness about Hundred Silent Ways, but it is also very elegant.
The opening is ambrosial and frankly sensual, a Rococo burst of sweet, syrupy peaches, mandarin orange, and tuberose petals so juicy sweet that you will want to gulp it down greedily, heedless of the red juice staining your mouth. Bathed in a cloud of marshmallow-soft musk, the fruit and flowers slowly become more abstract and hazier in feel, but thanks to a touch of cool, powdery iris, it never loses its sparkle. By the time you get to the nutty, savory woodiness of the sandalwood in the base, soaking up all the rich, buttery excesses of gardenia, fruit, and cream, you will have been completely won over by the inviting deliciousness of Hundred Silent Ways. It is the rare fruity floral that seduces you without so much as a word.","mandarin, tuberose, peach, white jasmine, gardenia, orris, vanilla, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired line poem rumi th century sufi poet closed mouth spoke hundred silent ways hundred silent ways communicates love wordlessly series little flourishes fruit flowers tender skin loved one undeniably girlish flirtatiousness hundred silent ways also elegant opening ambrosial frankly sensual rococo burst sweet syrupy peaches mandarin orange tuberose petals juicy sweet want gulp greedily heedless red juice staining mouth bathed cloud marshmallow soft musk fruit flowers slowly become abstract hazier feel thanks touch cool powdery iris never loses sparkle time get nutty savory woodiness sandalwood base soaking rich buttery excesses gardenia fruit cream completely inviting deliciousness hundred silent ways rare fruity floral seduces without much word,"mandarin, tuberose, peach, white jasmine, gardenia, orris, vanilla, sandalwood, vetiver"
Fan Your Flames Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Inspired by the Sufi poet Rumi's exhortation to; ""Set your life on fire. Seek those who fan your flames', Fan Your Fames is a fiery, semi-gourmand fragrance that is all about the kind of passion that spills over into obsession. Featuring a haze of white shisha smoke over a melange of woody coconut husks, booze, and a mossy, balsamic base, Fan Your Flames is a stunning take on tobacco that extends the material in several different directions at once. First, the dried fruit and molasses sweetness of tobacco leaf is drawn out in an exotic direction by way of coconut husk and rum, with a sort of fermented fruit undertone suggestive of Japanese brandy - the kind that costs $500 a bottle. Directly underneath this, coumarin coaxes the hay facets out of the tobacco leaf, introducing a uniquely dry, sunburned grass tonality that tempers the sweetness of the booze. In the base, cooling, greenish hints of fir, cedar, mint, and oakmoss emerge, accentuating the bitter woodiness inherent in dried tobacco leaves. Now imagine all this wrapped up in a haze of tarry smoke, like a leather armchair left to smolder in the ashes of a house fire. Fan Your Flames is intoxicating, obsessive, strange, and almost bewilderingly dense â wear it many times before the smoke starts to lift and you begin to understand its true beauty.","coconut, rum, tobacco, tonka, oakmoss, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired sufi poet rumi's exhortation set life fire seek fan flames' fan fames fiery semi gourmand fragrance kind passion spills obsession featuring haze white shisha smoke melange woody coconut husks booze mossy balsamic base fan flames stunning take tobacco extends material several different directions first dried fruit molasses sweetness tobacco leaf drawn exotic direction way coconut husk rum sort fermented fruit undertone suggestive japanese brandy kind costs bottle directly underneath coumarin coaxes hay facets tobacco leaf introducing uniquely dry sunburned grass tonality tempers sweetness booze base cooling greenish hints fir cedar mint oakmoss emerge accentuating bitter woodiness inherent dried tobacco leaves imagine wrapped haze tarry smoke like leather armchair left smolder ashes house fire fan flames intoxicating obsessive strange almost bewilderingly dense wear many times smoke starts lift begin understand true beauty,"coconut, rum, tobacco, tonka, oakmoss, cedarwood"
Afrika-Olifant Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Poised halfway between a masculine chypre and a musky oriental, Africa Olifant exerts a steady fascination over its wearer. But fear not - despite the extraordinary array of animalic notes packed into this scent, Africa Olifant pulls off the remarkable feat of being both richly dirty and a breeze to wear. If you love the mossy funk of old-school masculines like Antaeus, then this will be right down your alley. The structure of the fragrance is quite clever. Instead of a top-down flow of notes, imagine a glowing core emanating concentric circles of rich aromas that strike the nose all at once â rubber, bone-dry leather, fiery balsam, melting tar, bitter moss, musk. There's also a lot of myrrh, first bathing everything in a haze of smoke and then drying down to a lingering impression of licorice, stone and earth. Everything feels so elemental, and yet, at its core, Africa Olifant is a super-smooth leather with a surprisingly balmy freshness to it. Citrus and herbs provide lift, and a sweet-salty ambergris spotlights everything with its golden glow. The end result is a fragrance that feels solidly classical, but also animalic in a way that not many modern masculines are these days.","ambergris, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, castoreum, civet, leather, oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,poised halfway masculine chypre musky oriental africa olifant exerts steady fascination wearer fear despite extraordinary array animalic notes packed scent africa olifant pulls remarkable feat richly dirty breeze wear love mossy funk old school masculines like antaeus right alley structure fragrance quite clever instead top flow notes imagine glowing core emanating concentric circles rich aromas strike nose rubber bone dry leather fiery balsam melting tar bitter moss musk there's also lot myrrh first bathing everything haze smoke drying lingering impression licorice stone earth everything feels elemental yet core africa olifant super smooth leather surprisingly balmy freshness citrus herbs provide lift sweet salty ambergris spotlights everything golden glow end result fragrance feels solidly classical also animalic way many modern masculines days,"ambergris, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum, castoreum, civet, leather, oud, musk"
Ambra Calabria Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Ambra Calabria is an unusually fresh, leafy-green amber that departs from the standard model of vanilla and resin so thick you could stand a spoon up in 'em. The sour bite of Calabrian bergamot and the smoky greenness of the galbanum cut a swath through the amber, blowing it up with salt and air. This is what makes Ambra Calabria such a fantastic wear in hot summer weather.
But Ambra Calabria really gives you the best of both worlds. It has all the spiky freshness of a traditional eau de cologne but also all the robustness of a full-blown oriental. So while the opening act is full of tart green and lemony notes that will snap your head to attention, the second act is built for comfort, not speed, with creamy jasmine blossoms tucked behind the ear of a musky, salted caramel base that seems to go on forever. Sweet and inviting on the bottom, tart and energizing on top, Ambra Calabria is the olfactory equivalent of Key Lime pie with a sprinkle of anise and salt on top. Summer in a bottle, dare we say.","bergamot, galbanum, green leaves, jasmine, coriander, sweet amber, musk, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ambra calabria unusually fresh leafy green amber departs standard model vanilla resin thick could stand spoon 'em sour bite calabrian bergamot smoky greenness galbanum cut swath amber blowing salt air makes ambra calabria fantastic wear hot summer weather ambra calabria really gives best worlds spiky freshness traditional eau de cologne also robustness full blown oriental opening act full tart green lemony notes snap head attention second act built comfort speed creamy jasmine blossoms tucked behind ear musky salted caramel base seems go forever sweet inviting bottom tart energizing top ambra calabria olfactory equivalent key lime pie sprinkle anise salt top summer bottle dare say,"bergamot, galbanum, green leaves, jasmine, coriander, sweet amber, musk, vanilla"
Sultan Vetiver Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Sultan Vetiver recalls the former glory of Guerlain Vetiver before it was gutted by reforms - earthy, rich, and woody, and with a bitter anisic bite that will make you think of the blackest of licorice. It is a particularly toothsome, rugged example of vetiver, and one that true vetiver enthusiasts should make a point of seeking out. Despite the name, there is nothing particularly oriental about Sultan Vetiver, although there is a richly embroidered nutmeat texture in the drydown suggestive of creamy resin. With impressive focus, the scent hones in on the noble green root, showcasing three separate types of vetiver oil that in turn display a rich variety of facets ranging from salt marsh, hazelnut, freshly-mown grass, rose, black pepper, and citrus fruit. In the base, tonka and amber resin melt away all the pungency of the root, bathing everything in a sweet olive-green bath of creamy goodness. Sultan Vetiver is an authentic vetiver fragrance that just smells amazing â and one that we predict will thrill purists and the vetiver-shy alike.","java vetiver , anise, pink pepper, bergamot, bourbon vetiver, vetiver , neroli, tonka bean, amber, leather, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sultan vetiver recalls former glory guerlain vetiver gutted reforms earthy rich woody bitter anisic bite make think blackest licorice particularly toothsome rugged example vetiver one true vetiver enthusiasts make point seeking despite name nothing particularly oriental sultan vetiver although richly embroidered nutmeat texture drydown suggestive creamy resin impressive focus scent hones noble green root showcasing three separate types vetiver oil turn display rich variety facets ranging salt marsh hazelnut freshly mown grass rose black pepper citrus fruit base tonka amber resin melt away pungency root bathing everything sweet olive green bath creamy goodness sultan vetiver authentic vetiver fragrance smells amazing one predict thrill purists vetiver shy alike,"java vetiver , anise, pink pepper, bergamot, bourbon vetiver, vetiver , neroli, tonka bean, amber, leather, vetiver"
Suede et Safran Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Suede et Safran uses fiery Iranian saffron and Indian ambrette seed to build one of the most pleasurably buttery suede perfumes in existence. It smells like a soft, dun-colored suede jacket that's been rubbed down with red-gold spice and musk grains until the delicate fibers begin to break down and dissolve into thin air.
The juxtaposition between smoke and spice is played just right here, with the scent exerting a subtle undertow of sweetness that's downright addictive. Ambrette seed provides a boozy, unripe fruit note pitched halfway between pear and apple, and the vein of throaty spice lends a dark gingerbread sparkle. Quiet enough for day wear and yet assertive enough to give you billowing sillage on a big night out, Suede et Safran is the perfect fragrance for people who love creamy, haute-luxe leathers like Tuscan Leather and Black Saffron, but who want to branch out into a warmer, drier direction.","ambrette seed, saffron, suede, ginger, musk, caraway",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77407.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,suede et safran uses fiery iranian saffron indian ambrette seed build one pleasurably buttery suede perfumes existence smells like soft dun colored suede jacket that's rubbed red gold spice musk grains delicate fibers begin break dissolve thin air juxtaposition smoke spice played right scent exerting subtle undertow sweetness that's downright addictive ambrette seed provides boozy unripe fruit note pitched halfway pear apple vein throaty spice lends dark gingerbread sparkle quiet enough day wear yet assertive enough give billowing sillage big night suede et safran perfect fragrance people love creamy haute luxe leathers like tuscan leather black saffron want branch warmer drier direction,"ambrette seed, saffron, suede, ginger, musk, caraway"
Pachuli Kozha Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"Kozha means 'skin' in Turkish, so if you're thinking that Patchouli Kozha mixes sensual, skin-like notes with the earthiness of patchouli, then you'd be right. But Patchouli Kozha is so much more than that. In fact, before we get down to the loam, we must first pass through a meadow, the scent opening unexpectedly on a naturalistic accord of grass and flowers, wet and torn after a violent storm. The opening crackles with ozone and electricity, hyacinth striding to the fore, a green, almost bitter artemisia at its side. Soon after, one becomes aware of a potent, sensuous ylang ylang snaking its way out of the grass, ripe with banana flesh and leathery indole. But the humid, near tropical smell of the ylang is held in check by the bright, peppery patchouli, and together these notes create a light, raw leather redolent with mint leaf and anise. The patchouli-ylang pairing is not particularly earthy or sweet, but cool and herbaceous - effortlessly sexy in a natural, tousled-hair kind of way. In the base, a sweeter tone creeps in, honey and resin thickening the patchouli, and giving it a warm, rounded feel. Towards the far drydown, a nubbin of frankincense weaves in and out of the honeyed patchouli and florals, drying everything out in a silvery haze of smoke and ether.","hyacinth, ylang-ylang, artemisia, chamomile, patchouli, black pepper, leather, honey, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77408.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kozha means 'skin' turkish thinking patchouli kozha mixes sensual skin like notes earthiness patchouli right patchouli kozha much fact get loam must first pass meadow scent opening unexpectedly naturalistic accord grass flowers wet torn violent storm opening crackles ozone electricity hyacinth striding fore green almost bitter artemisia side soon one becomes aware potent sensuous ylang ylang snaking way grass ripe banana flesh leathery indole humid near tropical smell ylang held check bright peppery patchouli together notes create light raw leather redolent mint leaf anise patchouli ylang pairing particularly earthy sweet cool herbaceous effortlessly sexy natural tousled hair kind way base sweeter tone creeps honey resin thickening patchouli giving warm rounded feel towards far drydown nubbin frankincense weaves honeyed patchouli florals drying everything silvery haze smoke ether,"hyacinth, ylang-ylang, artemisia, chamomile, patchouli, black pepper, leather, honey, incense"
Tuberoza Extrait de Parfum,Nishane,"If Tuberoza had a color, it would be a mixture of yellows and golds. Know why we like this one? Because unlike most tuberose fragrances that try to restrain the natural fleshiness of tuberose, Tuberoza sets it free to be its gorgeous, sunny self. Framed by sweet orangey notes, ylang, and honeyed orange blossom, the tuberose smells magnificent here: a flashy explosion of creamy, tropical sweetness, with an undercurrent of fuel, banana custard, and rubber. This is tuberose with all the lights turned on. No effort has been made to dim its naturally bright, loud character. Instead, tropical ylang and gardenia coax it out further into the sun, encouraging an expansion of its creamy, sweet excesses. Amber and marigold, as bright as a newly-minted gold coin, glitters underneath, and in the base, the scent gets a double helping of cream with the addition of a full-fat sandalwood and pearly white musk. Put this on and gasp with pleasure as Tuberoza billows softly across your skin like a giant, golden nuclear mushroom cloud. Its bolshy, take-no-prisoners attitude is refreshing, and the end result totally worth the ride.","ylang-ylang, orange blossom, artemisia, tuberose, jasmine, marigold, amberwood, vetiver, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77416.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tuberoza color would mixture yellows golds know like one unlike tuberose fragrances try restrain natural fleshiness tuberose tuberoza sets free gorgeous sunny self framed sweet orangey notes ylang honeyed orange blossom tuberose smells magnificent flashy explosion creamy tropical sweetness undercurrent fuel banana custard rubber tuberose lights turned effort made dim naturally bright loud character instead tropical ylang gardenia coax sun encouraging expansion creamy sweet excesses amber marigold bright newly minted gold coin glitters underneath base scent gets double helping cream addition full fat sandalwood pearly white musk put gasp pleasure tuberoza billows softly across skin like giant golden nuclear mushroom cloud bolshy take prisoners attitude refreshing end result totally worth ride,"ylang-ylang, orange blossom, artemisia, tuberose, jasmine, marigold, amberwood, vetiver, sandalwood, musk"
A City On Fire Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""When I saw you, all I saw was a swirl of smoke in the streetlight. Elusive. Sinister. Spectacular."" -Machus.
A brilliantly dark graphic novel, A City On Fire, is the story of two match-makers. Rupert literally fabricates matches in a factory on the waterfront while Frances writes a dating column for the city's newspaper. Both are recluses who haunt the night's shadows observing clandestine activities from afar but never partaking. That changes one fortuitous evening when they are both witness to the same high-profile murder and are forced to come together as an unlikely vigilante pair in order to save their own names.
This scent is literally on fire - dark with firewood and spice, evoking both urban landscapes and the great outdoors, with smoke plumes rising into the air.

Slow Explosions Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""I was lost, aimless, and depressed. Now I'm only two of those things."" -Gwen K. Vroomen.
In 1980, Gwen K. Vroomen quit a monotonous job, went to the corner bar, and â on the bartender's urging â threw a dart at a world map tacked on the wall. She had never heard of Goa but knew immediately she needed to go. Three months later she was celebrating Hindu New Year at a tea garden high in the hills of Kerala, fireworks exploding below. She wrote of that night: 'I was resuscitated by color, redeemed by the vibrant unknown.' Her self-proclaimed 'Journey out of darkness, ' dotted with unforgettable stories of night markets, river floats, and harrowing moped rides, inspired a generation of young Americans eager to buck the drudgery of ordinary life. With pops of rose and hits of saffron, this scent explodes on the skin and awakens the senses. Every inhale will open you up to the idea of escape, push you to take risks, and embolden you to get truly lost.

Saint Julep Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"Tomorrow I will fight but tonight I recline into a sweet dream of muddled mint and ice.' â Milton Nevers.
On the outskirts of Clarksdale, Mississippi, at the end of a secluded dirt road sat a small ramshackle church. It was not a place of worship but rather where many went to seek refuge during impoverished times. Legend has it the structure was transported to the wild mint field by hand, hoisted on the shoulders of two dozen men. The outside remained simple and nondescript but the interior was aglow with pilfered neon signs, Christmas lights, and a jukebox donated by the sheriff's son. It was a distinctly secular place where locals who knew where to find it could share moonshine, socialize, and dance their troubles away. They called their ramshackle juke joint Saint Julep and the oral histories compiled within paint a picture of that magical place where 'the smiles was always free and salvation had the distinct smell of sweet mint.'
This scent is like a mint julep in the heat of the south, complete with invigorating mint leaves and a light bourbon body, with an added ""ice"" accord, sugar and a hint of magnolia. All of this adds up to arguably the perfect hot-weather scent.","sweet mint, tangerine, magnolia, bourbon, grisalva, sugarcube, crushed ice",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tomorrow fight tonight recline sweet dream muddled mint ice ' milton nevers outskirts clarksdale mississippi end secluded dirt road sat small ramshackle church place worship rather many went seek refuge impoverished times legend structure transported wild mint field hand hoisted shoulders two dozen men outside remained simple nondescript interior aglow pilfered neon signs christmas lights jukebox donated sheriff's son distinctly secular place locals knew find could share moonshine socialize dance troubles away called ramshackle juke joint saint julep oral histories compiled within paint picture magical place 'the smiles always free salvation distinct smell sweet mint ' scent like mint julep heat south complete invigorating mint leaves light bourbon body added ice accord sugar hint magnolia adds arguably perfect hot weather scent,"sweet mint, tangerine, magnolia, bourbon, grisalva, sugarcube, crushed ice"

It's a Comme des Garcons kind of move - take an androgynous watery-floral cologne that embodies the spirit of the 90's and infuse it with a shot of French old-school chic.

In continuing with Olfactive Studio's photographic inspirations, Close Up takes gourmand notes of coffee and cherry, and zooms in and out with both intensity and subtlety.
There is the appearance of the unexpected in every note. Close Up opens with a cherry that is not candy sweet, but sour, liquor-soaked, and complex as a Griotte cherry. Blooming with a fine dusting of spices with anise, the cherry is paired with green coffee beans, bitter and lightly reminiscent of its roasted twin. Here, the gourmand becomes a departure from the quotidian, and enters a strange universe where everything appears anew. When there is a nutty, toasted quality to the scent, it comes not from the coffee but from tobacco, multifaceted and warm.

Bull's Blood Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""A man who has killed is a man who knows passion."" - Devante Valereo.
Devante Valereo was raised in a dusty Spanish village on the Balearic Sea. He fondly recalled going to the bullfights with his father, an ex-picador, and credited those early experiences with inspiring his most popular novella, Bull's Blood. The book's lurid tale of seduction garnered obscenity charges against the author. Though the charges were rejected by the court, a ban on the sale of his works persisted for a number of years.
A fixture in Barcelona, smoking cigarillos and writing in the cafes and bars into the night, Valereo disappeared as a fugitive in 1967 after a highly publicized bar scuffle with American sailors, one of whom later died from his injuries. 'A man who has killed, ' he wrote in Bull's Blood, 'is a man who knows passion.' No exaggeration here, this is a highly animalic scent not for the faint of heart.","patchouli, rose, costus root, tobacco, black musk, bull's blood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,man killed man knows passion devante valereo devante valereo raised dusty spanish village balearic sea fondly recalled going bullfights father ex picador credited early experiences inspiring popular novella bull's blood book's lurid tale seduction garnered obscenity charges author though charges rejected court ban sale works persisted number years fixture barcelona smoking cigarillos writing cafes bars night valereo disappeared fugitive highly publicized bar scuffle american sailors one later died injuries 'a man killed ' wrote bull's blood 'is man knows passion ' exaggeration highly animalic scent faint heart,"patchouli, rose, costus root, tobacco, black musk, bull's blood"
Cape Heartache Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""If you are looking for the pieces of a broken heart, you might try rifling through the twigs and needles on the forest floor."" - Philip Sava.
Cape Heartache is the lone American contribution to Philip Sava's wildly popular series of exploration novels. It is based loosely on an expedition he made to the Pacific Northwest as a teenager in 1881 and is generally regarded as the most candid of his works. Revolving around a homestead he built in a coastal grove of old growth trees, the novel documents his romance with a young woman who was a descendent of the Nehalem Indian Tribe.

Memoirs of a Trespasser Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""Who needs love when there is still cognac in the glass?"" - Philip Sava.
The early exploration writing of Philip Sava bent the limits of post-modern fiction, revealing fantastical worlds that fooled many into believing they were, in fact, real. Sava's kaleidoscopic collections, of which Memoirs of a Trespasser is the undeniable centerpiece, drew upon true experiences from his exotic travels but were infused with a hallucinatory inventiveness that set his work apart from others in the genre.
Though Sava had associates all over the world, he spent most of his time living in solitude on a ranch in southern Madagascar. Memoirs opens beguilingly with a fresh, bright vanilla, and grows deeper with oak and guiac smoke.","vanilla, guaiacwood, myrrh, benzoin resin, ambrette seeds, oak barrels",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,needs love still cognac glass philip sava early exploration writing philip sava bent limits post modern fiction revealing fantastical worlds fooled many believing fact real sava's kaleidoscopic collections memoirs trespasser undeniable centerpiece drew upon true experiences exotic travels infused hallucinatory inventiveness set work apart others genre though sava associates world spent time living solitude ranch southern madagascar memoirs opens beguilingly fresh bright vanilla grows deeper oak guiac smoke,"vanilla, guaiacwood, myrrh, benzoin resin, ambrette seeds, oak barrels"
The Cobra & The Canary Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""We were driving faster than dammit, headed due west for a place called Anywhere But Here."" - James Spundt.
When a tip from a clairvoyant leads 23-year old Neal Orris to a rural Connecticut barn housing his deceased father's secret obsession, a pristine 1964 Shelby Cobra Roadster, it is the getaway ticket he was desperately searching for. After liberating his best friend Ike from his dead-end job on the family farm, the two hit the open highway. Aiming for the Palm Springs race tracks, their journey is a blur of seedy motels, cool swimming pools, hot debutantes, cocktails, and cigarette smoke. Each stop finds the friends inventing new pseudonyms and personas for themselves, their innocent game hurtling into the depths of decadence and desolation. Like smoking a spicy cigar on an aged leather seat, driving with the windows down and smelling the summer heat rise from asphalt.

The Soft Lawn Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""They hopped the fence of the Governor's Mansion, laid side by side on the cool grass tennis court, and invented constellations until the sunrise usurped their astral empire."" - Claude LeCoq.
Claude LeCoq published his first book, The Soft Lawn, in 1916 while still attending Princeton University. A controversial portrait of adolescent upper-class rebellion in New England, the coming-of-age story follows Hampton Perry, a charmingly snotty college tennis champ who, after years of having everything handed to him on a silver platter, finds himself handing it all back.

Yesterday Haze Eau de Parfum,Imaginary Authors,"""Just as sunsets are more beautiful on hazy days so, too, are the memories of yesterday."" - Lenora Blumberg.
'Yesterday Haze, ' the subtly sinister follow-up to Lenora Blumberg's acclaimed debut 'Violet Disguise' tells the story of a farmer's wife who, after maintaining a decades-long affair with a crop duster pilot, decides to come clean to her husband (who also happens to be her lover's employer). 'The memory of him is a rifle in my mouth,' Blumberg wrote, 'and the scent of fig its trigger.' Set in California's tranquil and dusty San Joaquin Valley, the elaborate tale unfolds like a dream, delicately shifting perceptions like the colors of a dimming dusk. Soft, ripe figs and a woodsy iris form the perfect gauze over your skin. Seductive yet dreamlike.","fig, iris, cream, tonka, tree bark, walnut bitters, orchard dust",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/77510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sunsets beautiful hazy days memories yesterday lenora blumberg 'yesterday haze ' subtly sinister follow lenora blumberg's acclaimed debut 'violet disguise' tells story farmer's wife maintaining decades long affair crop duster pilot decides come clean husband also happens lover's employer 'the memory rifle mouth ' blumberg wrote 'and scent fig trigger ' set california's tranquil dusty san joaquin valley elaborate tale unfolds like dream delicately shifting perceptions like colors dimming dusk soft ripe figs woodsy iris form perfect gauze skin seductive yet dreamlike,"fig, iris, cream, tonka, tree bark, walnut bitters, orchard dust"
Empathy Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Empathy is the meeting of two minds, and in this eponymous perfume, there is a meeting of two elements that are just as simpatico with each other: a bright, boozy raspberry-pear accord and a smoky, ashy tobacco. Although it leans slightly feminine, anyone who appreciates Tuscan Leather should take note.
The fruit element is playful and interesting: the raspberry is not the hyper-sugared variant seen in fruitchoulis, but rather a tart, fuzzy variant soaked in the Cognac-like richness of davana and pear juice. Rising up to meet and subsume it is a wave of darker, more serious elements â a Patrician accord of cigarillo ash, dry tobacco, and musk, all of which merge into a grey suede that touches briefly on Tuscan Leather but skitters away again into something creamier and hazier. The bright raspberry endures throughout, and actually kind of symbolizes the appeal of this scent: sparkling but sturdy and tenacious. A fruit scent with steel in its backbone.","pear blossom, raspberry flowers, davana, fruity tobacco, raspberry infusion, scorched wood, transparent mosses, benzoin, silver fir, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,empathy meeting two minds eponymous perfume meeting two elements simpatico bright boozy raspberry pear accord smoky ashy tobacco although leans slightly feminine anyone appreciates tuscan leather take note fruit element playful interesting raspberry hyper sugared variant seen fruitchoulis rather tart fuzzy variant soaked cognac like richness davana pear juice rising meet subsume wave darker serious elements patrician accord cigarillo ash dry tobacco musk merge grey suede touches briefly tuscan leather skitters away something creamier hazier bright raspberry endures throughout actually kind symbolizes appeal scent sparkling sturdy tenacious fruit scent steel backbone,"pear blossom, raspberry flowers, davana, fruity tobacco, raspberry infusion, scorched wood, transparent mosses, benzoin, silver fir, oud"
Altruist Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"This is the new Eau de Parfum version of Altruist, originally released in 2016 as a collaboration between J.F. Schwarzlose and the Berlin artist Paul deFlorian. The result of a series of intense conversations between perfumer Veronique Nyberg and deFlorian, every note in Altruist represents a color or brushstroke from one of deFlorian's paintings. It is an unusual concept for a perfume, but one that works so beautifully it's been shortlisted for the Independent Perfume category in the Art and Olfaction Awards 2017. Altruist opens with fresh, sparkling notes of bergamot, lemon, and ginger representing the swirls of light green and aquamarine colors on the painting, while the warmer slashes of red and orange on the canvas are translated via the explosive heat of cracked black pepper and nutmeg. The almost sterile 'froideur' of the man's sightless gaze in the painting is portrayed through use of a special MANE captive molecule called Aqual, which gives the scent a cold, crystalline shimmer, like sunlight on a diamond. For the new EDP version, the perfumer and artist decided to add Ambrarome, a material that gives the perfume a dense, dry woodiness with an undertone of something moist and bitter, creating the delightful effect of paper dipped in Japanese calligraphy ink. DeFlorian himself calls Altruist a 'scent for feminists, cyborgs and survivors', and in our opinion, it is the perfect summer fragrance for those who like a balance between the sappy freshness of citrus and the tinder-dry crackle of woods and spice.","bergamot, lemon, ginger, watery notes, rose, orange blossom, nutmeg, black pepper, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, ambrarome",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76900.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,new eau de parfum version altruist originally released collaboration j f schwarzlose berlin artist paul deflorian result series intense conversations perfumer veronique nyberg deflorian every note altruist represents color brushstroke one deflorian's paintings unusual concept perfume one works beautifully shortlisted independent perfume category art olfaction awards altruist opens fresh sparkling notes bergamot lemon ginger representing swirls light green aquamarine colors painting warmer slashes red orange canvas translated via explosive heat cracked black pepper nutmeg almost sterile 'froideur' man's sightless gaze painting portrayed use special mane captive molecule called aqual gives scent cold crystalline shimmer like sunlight diamond new edp version perfumer artist decided add ambrarome material gives perfume dense dry woodiness undertone something moist bitter creating delightful effect paper dipped japanese calligraphy ink deflorian calls altruist 'scent feminists cyborgs survivors' opinion perfect summer fragrance like balance sappy freshness citrus tinder dry crackle woods spice,"bergamot, lemon, ginger, watery notes, rose, orange blossom, nutmeg, black pepper, cedar, vetiver, patchouli, ambrarome"
Leder 6 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"Leder. Even the sound of the German word for leather sounds uber naughty, doesn't it? But if you're worried that Leder 6 is a hardcore leather with the full-on kink factor of a Berlin night club, then rest easy â it's not. With its notes of hot milk, candy, and rubber, Leder 6 is more rakish than kinky. More importantly, it's gorgeous and all kinds of addictive.
Leder 6 starts out with a creamy white leather accord that's as ergonomically smooth as the interior of a brand new Porsche. The suede upholstery, although streamlined and modern in feel, is enriched with accents of warm vanilla milk, white chocolate, candied apricots, and a strange but delicious biscuit-like tone. At first steamy and moist, the fragrance grows increasingly dry and powdery, with notes of rubber, resin, and gun smoke emerging in the drydown. In the final tally, we find Leder 6's heady mix of rubber and milk to be bold and exotic, but also as inviting as a deeply-powdered bosom. A fragrance that titillates rather than provokes, and in our opinion, all the better for it.","osmanthus, saffron, leather, milk, vanilla, incense, styrax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,leder even sound german word leather sounds uber naughty worried leder hardcore leather full kink factor berlin night club rest easy notes hot milk candy rubber leder rakish kinky importantly gorgeous kinds addictive leder starts creamy white leather accord that's ergonomically smooth interior brand new porsche suede upholstery although streamlined modern feel enriched accents warm vanilla milk white chocolate candied apricots strange delicious biscuit like tone first steamy moist fragrance grows increasingly dry powdery notes rubber resin gun smoke emerging drydown final tally find leder 's heady mix rubber milk bold exotic also inviting deeply powdered bosom fragrance titillates rather provokes opinion better,"osmanthus, saffron, leather, milk, vanilla, incense, styrax"
Zeitgeist Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"Think all modern marine fragrances rely too heavily on the melon sweetness of Calone? Try Zeitgeist. It's the rare marine fragrance that, although composed of a long list of laboratory molecules, pulls off the feat of smelling utterly natural. If you love the collected smells caught in your sweater after a walk on a cold beach â ozone, salt, minerals, and the faint musk of warm skin â then this fragrance is for you. Structured around the salty glitter of ambergris and the damp, almost fruity greenness of seaweed, Zeitgeist works beautifully on both girls and boys who love the Great Outdoors. The scent gains lift through a complex arrangement of musks, infusing the structure with space and air, and making it a feather-light wear. Warmed through from the base with a golden nugget of spicy Peru balsam and dusty woods, there is an exquisite balance between the briny wetness of the ocean and the dryness of driftwood. Zeitgeist is a subtly sexy fragrance for summer that makes us hear the roar of the ocean even when we're stuck inside.","amber xtreme, balsam, calone, seaweed, nebulone, edelonide, leatherwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76902.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,think modern marine fragrances rely heavily melon sweetness calone try zeitgeist rare marine fragrance although composed long list laboratory molecules pulls feat smelling utterly natural love collected smells caught sweater walk cold beach ozone salt minerals faint musk warm skin fragrance structured around salty glitter ambergris damp almost fruity greenness seaweed zeitgeist works beautifully girls boys love great outdoors scent gains lift complex arrangement musks infusing structure space air making feather light wear warmed base golden nugget spicy peru balsam dusty woods exquisite balance briny wetness ocean dryness driftwood zeitgeist subtly sexy fragrance summer makes us hear roar ocean even we're stuck inside,"amber xtreme, balsam, calone, seaweed, nebulone, edelonide, leatherwood"
Rausch Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"Rausch means rush in German, and boy, they weren't kidding - this is one powerful rush to the head that you won't forget in a hurry. One spritz of this stunning fragrance and you are ready for a night of Berlin-style debauchery that even Baudelaire would be proud of. Rausch starts us off in a haze of dry smoke from the club, dark and thrillingly bitter on the tongue, woody and strange. Then a roar of golden oud and amber suddenly swells up from beneath, engulfing your senses in a tidal wave of aged whiskey, red pepper, and rich, resiny balsam. There is plenty of earthy patchouli, a musky, dirty vanilla too, which in combination with the leathery oud gives the fragrance the feel of something depraved and illicit, something dug up from undisturbed soil. Deeply sexy in an almost bewildering way, the raunchy Rausch is a fragrance that broadcasts at ten paces and is therefore perfect for the clubs: wear this and find men, women, and children drawn to you as if you've rolled around in catnip.","red pepper, sandalwood, cypriol, patchouli, vanilla bean, amber, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76904.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rausch means rush german boy kidding one powerful rush head forget hurry one spritz stunning fragrance ready night berlin style debauchery even baudelaire would proud rausch starts us haze dry smoke club dark thrillingly bitter tongue woody strange roar golden oud amber suddenly swells beneath engulfing senses tidal wave aged whiskey red pepper rich resiny balsam plenty earthy patchouli musky dirty vanilla combination leathery oud gives fragrance feel something depraved illicit something dug undisturbed soil deeply sexy almost bewildering way raunchy rausch fragrance broadcasts ten paces therefore perfect clubs wear find men women children drawn rolled around catnip,"red pepper, sandalwood, cypriol, patchouli, vanilla bean, amber, oud"
IA-33 Eau de Parfum,J.F. Schwarzlose,"Named for the original car license plate of pre-war Berlin, 1A-33 is J. F. Schwarzlose's first modern retooling of one of their heritage perfumes. If you're thinking there's a classic tone to this perfume, then you'd be right, especially with the scent's emphasis on the rich aroma of linden blossom trees in full bloom along the famous Unter den Linden Boulevard in Berlin. It draws the mind immediately to the bourgeois pleasures of sipping tea and reading the morning news in a cafe in the dappled shade. But this is not a perfume drowning under the weight of nostalgia - it is neither staid nor powdery. In fact, in its perfectly-judged balance between the creamy honey of magnolia, linden blossom, and jasmine and the sharpness of pink pepper and mandarin, 1A-33 reveals itself to be a thoroughly modern fragrance. It's this peppery little kick to the gait of this perfume that makes it such a joy to wear, especially on cool, sunny mornings. One spray of this and you're guaranteed to feel all the euphoria of spring in Berlin, flowers and leaves bursting into life above your head. A perfume with eyes set firmly forward to the future, not backwards to the past.","mandarine, pink pepper, spree river accord, jasmine sambac, lime-tree blossom, magnolia, cedarwood, iris powder",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,named original car license plate pre war berlin j f schwarzlose's first modern retooling one heritage perfumes thinking there's classic tone perfume right especially scent's emphasis rich aroma linden blossom trees full bloom along famous unter den linden boulevard berlin draws mind immediately bourgeois pleasures sipping tea reading morning news cafe dappled shade perfume drowning weight nostalgia neither staid powdery fact perfectly judged balance creamy honey magnolia linden blossom jasmine sharpness pink pepper mandarin reveals thoroughly modern fragrance peppery little kick gait perfume makes joy wear especially cool sunny mornings one spray guaranteed feel euphoria spring berlin flowers leaves bursting life head perfume eyes set firmly forward future backwards past,"mandarine, pink pepper, spree river accord, jasmine sambac, lime-tree blossom, magnolia, cedarwood, iris powder"

Blossom Love Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Fresh with the vibrant romance of springtime, Blossom Love is as resplendent as the blossoming cherry trees that give inspiration to this new addition to Amouage's Secret Garden collection. Bright, beautiful, and gently gourmand, it's the perfect scent to greet the changing weather, a paean to the joy and meaning inherent in the transition of the seasons. Opening with the luscious freshness of cherry blossoms suspended in a lightly boozy rose liqueur, Blossom Love gives an almost instantaneous feeling of giddiness, tempered with just enough restraint to never lose its youthful energy. A sweet floral heart, ylang touched with amaretto, is equally bubbly, making our mouths water and our hearts burst forth with seasonal enthusiasm. A rich yet understated drydown of tonka, sandalwood and vanilla likewise exudes a solar warmth, never crossing over into dessert territory but rather suspending us in a near-weightless bliss, a deeply romantic springtime fantasy that seems to hover above the ground. Cherry blossoms are all the more beautiful for how fleeting their bloom can be. With Blossom Love, that unabashed beauty can now be enjoyed any day of the year.","cherry blossom nectar, rose liquor, ylang-ylang, amaretto, vanilla, tonka bean, sandalwood, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41885.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fresh vibrant romance springtime blossom love resplendent blossoming cherry trees give inspiration new addition amouage's secret garden collection bright beautiful gently gourmand perfect scent greet changing weather paean joy meaning inherent transition seasons opening luscious freshness cherry blossoms suspended lightly boozy rose liqueur blossom love gives almost instantaneous feeling giddiness tempered enough restraint never lose youthful energy sweet floral heart ylang touched amaretto equally bubbly making mouths water hearts burst forth seasonal enthusiasm rich yet understated drydown tonka sandalwood vanilla likewise exudes solar warmth never crossing dessert territory rather suspending us near weightless bliss deeply romantic springtime fantasy seems hover ground cherry blossoms beautiful fleeting bloom blossom love unabashed beauty enjoyed day year,"cherry blossom nectar, rose liquor, ylang-ylang, amaretto, vanilla, tonka bean, sandalwood, cashmeran"
Epidor Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Inspired by the enduring traditions of the autumn wheat harvest in France, Epidor is not simply a fragrance, but a portal to a simpler time. Originally introduced in 1912, Epidor evokes images of sun-kissed youth from farming villages, exhausted from a hard day's work, resting in the newly cropped fields and daydreaming about the night's celebrations, and hopefully, romances. Epidor's nostalgically lovely scent is built around the multifaceted richness of tonka bean, a material that can elicit tones of fresh hay, vanilla, and sweet florals all at once, but the fragrance opens first with a rich autumnal blend of sweet, musky violet and juicy plum, followed quickly by a lushly natural white floral heart of jasmine and orange blossom. By the time the tonka asserts itself, we're deeply enthralled, awash in the warmth of the setting sun and the bucolic splendor of the French countryside. Gentle, comforting and evocative, Epidor is a fragrance of simple, wondrous beauty.","violet, plum, jasmine, orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired enduring traditions autumn wheat harvest france epidor simply fragrance portal simpler time originally introduced epidor evokes images sun kissed youth farming villages exhausted hard day's work resting newly cropped fields daydreaming night's celebrations hopefully romances epidor's nostalgically lovely scent built around multifaceted richness tonka bean material elicit tones fresh hay vanilla sweet florals fragrance opens first rich autumnal blend sweet musky violet juicy plum followed quickly lushly natural white floral heart jasmine orange blossom time tonka asserts we're deeply enthralled awash warmth setting sun bucolic splendor french countryside gentle comforting evocative epidor fragrance simple wondrous beauty,"violet, plum, jasmine, orange blossom, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla"
Sole di Positano Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"There is nothing like the thrill of a good citrus to refresh on a hot summer's day, and this is a superb rendition. Although done very much in the style of Neroli Portofino with its bitter, sun-drenched citrus notes, Sole di Positano offers a more Spring-like variation by adding wet, fresh green notes like lily of the valley and shiso leaf, and a graceful oakmoss drydown that smells like cool shade and oaked wine. But still, this is the Amalfi coast, and the citrus notes reign supreme. The bitter green and yellow fizz of bergamot, bitter orange, lemons, and shiso act like a cold shower on a hot day, drenching the wearer in icy freshness from head to toe. Pull your nose back from the skin, and it is the cool, soapy neroli and orange blossom that lingers most in the air, providing for a clever dual effect of bitter citrus up close and crisp white floral from afar. Arched over a sturdy, mossy base and 'fixed' in place by the florals and herbs, this effect goes on forever. An elegant solution to the usually fleeting pleasure of the eau de cologne!","bergamot, bitter orange, mandarin, lemon, shiso leaf, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, jasmine, lily of the valley, neroli, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63558.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nothing like thrill good citrus refresh hot summer's day superb rendition although done much style neroli portofino bitter sun drenched citrus notes sole di positano offers spring like variation adding wet fresh green notes like lily valley shiso leaf graceful oakmoss drydown smells like cool shade oaked wine still amalfi coast citrus notes reign supreme bitter green yellow fizz bergamot bitter orange lemons shiso act like cold shower hot day drenching wearer icy freshness head toe pull nose back skin cool soapy neroli orange blossom lingers air providing clever dual effect bitter citrus close crisp white floral afar arched sturdy mossy base 'fixed' place florals herbs effect goes forever elegant solution usually fleeting pleasure eau de cologne,"bergamot, bitter orange, mandarin, lemon, shiso leaf, orange blossom, ylang-ylang, jasmine, lily valley, neroli, moss"
Absolue d'Osmanthe Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"If osmanthus is having a moment in modern perfumery, it's a well-deserved one: elegantly fruity, sensual and softly creamy, it's long past time that this beautiful floral stepped out of the supporting shadows and into the limelight. And it would be hard to think of a more impressive debutante than Absolue d'Osmanthe, an utterly stunning new floral scent fresh off of taking Esxence 2017 by storm and now ready to go worldwide. Fresh and fruity, but also richly mouthwatering and romantic, this is everything we always suspected a perfect osmanthus scent could be. Absolue d'Osmanthe wastes no time putting its gorgeous title ingredient front and center, opening bright and fruity with the apricot-like tones the flower is known for. As with all great soliflore scents, the supporting notes are meant less to twist the fragrance in any particular direction and more to coax out each facet of the featured player, and Absolue completely delivers: plum to add juicy depth to the fruity notes and rose and jasmine to accentuate the luscious softness. As it dries, subtly rich balsamic, woodsy and creamy notes (with just the right hint of animalic castoreum) emerge to resonate with the smooth, leather-toned sexiness hidden within osmanthus's soft lactonic depths. Is Absolue d'Osmanthe the perfect osmanthus scent? At the very least, we're confident when we say this impossibly gorgeous fragrance is going to be quite hard for future challengers to top.","osmanthus, plum, baie rose, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, tolu balsam, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla, dry woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70208.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,osmanthus moment modern perfumery well deserved one elegantly fruity sensual softly creamy long past time beautiful floral stepped supporting shadows limelight would hard think impressive debutante absolue d'osmanthe utterly stunning new floral scent fresh taking esxence storm ready go worldwide fresh fruity also richly mouthwatering romantic everything always suspected perfect osmanthus scent could absolue d'osmanthe wastes time putting gorgeous title ingredient front center opening bright fruity apricot like tones flower known great soliflore scents supporting notes meant less twist fragrance particular direction coax facet featured player absolue completely delivers plum add juicy depth fruity notes rose jasmine accentuate luscious softness dries subtly rich balsamic woodsy creamy notes right hint animalic castoreum emerge resonate smooth leather toned sexiness hidden within osmanthus's soft lactonic depths absolue d'osmanthe perfect osmanthus scent least we're confident say impossibly gorgeous fragrance going quite hard future challengers top,"osmanthus, plum, baie rose, jasmine sambac, sandalwood, tolu balsam, castoreum, labdanum, vanilla, dry woods"
Santal du Pacifique Eau de Parfum,Perris Monte Carlo,"There's a reason why sandalwood is among the most important and widely used materials in fragrance, with a versatility that allows perfumers to explore everything from creamy richness to sophisticated coolness. Featuring an extraordinary sandalwood from the South Pacific, where the species was discovered, Santal du Pacifique demonstrates the full range of this majestic material, woodsy, naturalistic, but also velvety and smooth, all in the service of a fragrance that manages to perfectly balance elegance with simplicity.
Every supplemental ingredient in Santal du Pacifique seems expertly chosen to enhance the titular material, from the earthy balance of the carrot and earthy floral opening, to the rich balsam and smooth musk of the later stages.

Vanille Blackberry,Comptoir Sud Pacifique,"A heavenly exercise by Comptoir Sud Pacifique, exploring the possibilities for a fragrance both fresh and velvety-soft. Vanille Blackberry sings brightly from the start, opening playfully tart with a burst of fizzing lemon and bergamot. Then, the lovely cloud of floral fruit takes over, with rose and jasmine in attendance, but never too heady, just light and pretty. But in the billowing cloud, the stars of the show are blackberry and vanilla, forming a sweet, velvety-soft melange. The blackberry creates a perfect, lightly piquant contrast to the swoon-worthy classic Comptoir Sud Pacifique vanilla. Like a tea-time delicacy, this soft, floral-fruity vanilla just gets smoother in the drydown, light and delicate, enveloped in white musk and cashmere woods. Luscious, fluffy, yet glowing - a must for any vanilla lover.","lemon, bergamot, rose, jasmine, blackberry, pink berries, musk, vanilla, cashmere wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/23814.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,heavenly exercise comptoir sud pacifique exploring possibilities fragrance fresh velvety soft vanille blackberry sings brightly start opening playfully tart burst fizzing lemon bergamot lovely cloud floral fruit takes rose jasmine attendance never heady light pretty billowing cloud stars show blackberry vanilla forming sweet velvety soft melange blackberry creates perfect lightly piquant contrast swoon worthy classic comptoir sud pacifique vanilla like tea time delicacy soft floral fruity vanilla gets smoother drydown light delicate enveloped white musk cashmere woods luscious fluffy yet glowing must vanilla lover,"lemon, bergamot, rose, jasmine, blackberry, pink berries, musk, vanilla, cashmere wood"
Une Tonne de Roses Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"So called because it takes 3.5 tons of rose petals to make just one kilo of rose essence, Une Tonne de Roses has a natural delicacy that belies its hefty name. It opens with a fresh, soft pink rose glistening with the wet sparkle of fruit â green apple or an Asian pear, perhaps. There is also, briefly, a hint of something winey and truffled playing around the edges of the rose, but it never commits to darkness. This is an innocent little rosebud of a rose, just about to burst into being.
We start out in Spring, with a dewy rose, but we end up in Fall, with a clean, earthy patchouli. Although more a watercolor than the gouache of Almairac's earlier masterpiece, Voleur de Roses, Une Tonne de Roses completes a similar journey, fading from the pale pink blush of the rose to the golden brown leaf mulch of patchouli. Finishing in a clean, crystalline musk, Une Tonne de Roses strikes us as a Japanese screen version of the ever-popular rose and patchouli combination â delicate, crisp, and achingly pretty.","rose, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,called takes tons rose petals make one kilo rose essence une tonne de roses natural delicacy belies hefty name opens fresh soft pink rose glistening wet sparkle fruit green apple asian pear perhaps also briefly hint something winey truffled playing around edges rose never commits darkness innocent little rosebud rose burst start spring dewy rose end fall clean earthy patchouli although watercolor gouache almairac's earlier masterpiece voleur de roses une tonne de roses completes similar journey fading pale pink blush rose golden brown leaf mulch patchouli finishing clean crystalline musk une tonne de roses strikes us japanese screen version ever popular rose patchouli combination delicate crisp achingly pretty,"rose, patchouli"
Flavia Vanilla Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Inspired by the lyrical, shiny-eyed beauty of an Italian girl called Flavia that Michel Almairac once knew, Flavia Vanilla is a dark, minimally smoky floral vanilla with hints of a tropical, humid ylang ylang playing at its edges. The spiced banana flambe of ylang of the opening notes is as attention-getting as a confident lady who dances her way through a crowded piazzo. But there is also a fresh, youthful breeze running through the perfume â a touch of green magnolia-like notes from the michelia flower that serve to keep the flamboyant sensuality of the custardy ylang firmly in check. Flavia Vanilla is a scent that reminds us that simplicity is the key to true beauty, and that sometimes all that's need is fresh vanilla, flowers, and a trace of smoke to fill the heart with pleasure.","ylang-ylang, michelia, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired lyrical shiny eyed beauty italian girl called flavia michel almairac knew flavia vanilla dark minimally smoky floral vanilla hints tropical humid ylang ylang playing edges spiced banana flambe ylang opening notes attention getting confident lady dances way crowded piazzo also fresh youthful breeze running perfume touch green magnolia like notes michelia flower serve keep flamboyant sensuality custardy ylang firmly check flavia vanilla scent reminds us simplicity key true beauty sometimes that's need fresh vanilla flowers trace smoke fill heart pleasure,"ylang-ylang, michelia, vanilla, sugar"
Totally White Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Totally White captures the ethereal, foggy dew of a spring morning in a Parisian city park. It smells like a field of wildflowers waking up en masse. The delicate, slightly honeyed scent of lilac and wisteria mingle with the intoxicatingly bitter, leathery scent of the hawthorn bushes, creating an effect so pollen-rich and watery-cool that you'd forgive early morning joggers for looking dazed and slightly drunk. This is a fragrance whose subtlety might make you forget you're wearing it but for the perceptible effect it has on people around you. The pale, soft-focus blurriness of the florals merges so completely with the pheromones of your own skin that people hugging you will pull you a little tighter, entranced by what they think is your natural smell. It is an intimate, soft scent, the foggy musk and pale spring flowers all working together to form a muted color palette against which your own personality sparkles like a diamond. Beautiful work.","lilac, wisteria, hawthorn",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,totally white captures ethereal foggy dew spring morning parisian city park smells like field wildflowers waking en masse delicate slightly honeyed scent lilac wisteria mingle intoxicatingly bitter leathery scent hawthorn bushes creating effect pollen rich watery cool forgive early morning joggers looking dazed slightly drunk fragrance whose subtlety might make forget wearing perceptible effect people around pale soft focus blurriness florals merges completely pheromones skin people hugging pull little tighter entranced think natural smell intimate soft scent foggy musk pale spring flowers working together form muted color palette personality sparkles like diamond beautiful work,"lilac, wisteria, hawthorn"
Cedar Woodpecker Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"The amusingly-named Cedar Woodpecker is a spicy, citrusy cedar fragrance with impeccable taste and noble lineage. At once robust and refined, the rich Virginian cedarwood forms the glowing brown heart of the fragrance, displaying a stoutness of character you just know you can rely on. On top, a turbo-charged cedrat fizzes and snaps like a cable wire loose in a storm âÂ this note is exciting and has movement, charging the sturdy cedar underneath with electricity. The contrast between the sourness of that green citrus and the warmth of the cedar is both exhilarating and comfortable. It just works. A dove-grey iris in the base is a fluffy pillow on which the cedar finally rests his grizzled, noble old head. The faint hint of powdery florals doesn't detract from the muscular, essentially woody, masculine character of the scent, but rather add a velvety softness that soothes and calms. The iris also introduces the faint echo of Guerlainade: lovers of the classic Habit Rouge might want to check out its more modern, stripped-down, and rugged younger brother. In an age when men are short-changed on good masculines, Cedar Woodpecker comes as a welcome surprise.","cedar, citrus, iris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,amusingly named cedar woodpecker spicy citrusy cedar fragrance impeccable taste noble lineage robust refined rich virginian cedarwood forms glowing brown heart fragrance displaying stoutness character know rely top turbo charged cedrat fizzes snaps like cable wire loose storm note exciting movement charging sturdy cedar underneath electricity contrast sourness green citrus warmth cedar exhilarating comfortable works dove grey iris base fluffy pillow cedar finally rests grizzled noble old head faint hint powdery florals detract muscular essentially woody masculine character scent rather add velvety softness soothes calms iris also introduces faint echo guerlainade lovers classic habit rouge might want check modern stripped rugged younger brother age men short changed good masculines cedar woodpecker comes welcome surprise,"cedar, citrus, iris"
Milky Musk Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"In the late 1990's and under the direction of Tom Ford, Michel Almairac created one of the most iconic perfumes of the 20th century: Gucci Rush. A massive lactonic peach with a voice like a foghorn, it wore like the tightest, shiniest red vinyl dress ever created. Now twenty years later, Michel picks up the reins again to create a softer, muskier version that explores the same theme of milk and fruit, but this time with an indoors voice. Milky Musk first melts a leafy-green, coconutty fig down into a pool of warm, creamy sandalwood and wraps it all in a cloudy, milky musk that feels like cashmere. Soft and vaporous, it shifts around the body like a second skin as the wearer moves. Over time, the musk parts to reveal the bitterness of fruit skin, giving the creamy lactones an adult bite. Imagine a slimmed-down Rush, grown soft and husky with age, and you're in the right ballpark. It's adorable.","sandalwood, musk, fig",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76705.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,late 's direction tom ford michel almairac created one iconic perfumes th century gucci rush massive lactonic peach voice like foghorn wore like tightest shiniest red vinyl dress ever created twenty years later michel picks reins create softer muskier version explores theme milk fruit time indoors voice milky musk first melts leafy green coconutty fig pool warm creamy sandalwood wraps cloudy milky musk feels like cashmere soft vaporous shifts around body like second skin wearer moves time musk parts reveal bitterness fruit skin giving creamy lactones adult bite imagine slimmed rush grown soft husky age right ballpark adorable,"sandalwood, musk, fig"
Tomboy Neroli Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Tomboy Neroli is a paradox: sexy and clean. It smells like a freshly-laundered cotton t-shirt stripped off a hot, young body that has been wearing a classic eau de cologne all day. Male or female? Doesn't matter. When it's this good, it's for everyone. The crisp greenness of neroli up top is as refreshing as drenching oneself in eau de cologne straight from the fridge on a hot day. As it melts into the waxy orange blossom notes underneath, the neroli loses its freshness and becomes subsumed by the honeyed warmth of the white floral. All of this draped over a smoky woody amber that gives you the chemical high of a good white musk. The equivalent of the perfect white t-shirt, this one's for sexy tomboys everywhere.","neroli, orange blossom, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76706.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tomboy neroli paradox sexy clean smells like freshly laundered cotton shirt stripped hot young body wearing classic eau de cologne day male female matter good everyone crisp greenness neroli top refreshing drenching oneself eau de cologne straight fridge hot day melts waxy orange blossom notes underneath neroli loses freshness becomes subsumed honeyed warmth white floral draped smoky woody amber gives chemical high good white musk equivalent perfect white shirt one's sexy tomboys everywhere,"neroli, orange blossom, amber"
Woody Perfecto Eau de Parfum,Parle Moi de Parfum,"Woody Perfecto is a seemingly simple mix of coffee, vetiver, and leather, but there is something so nailed about this fragrance that it's hard to keep a grin off our face. Coffee is a difficult note to pull off; in Woody Perfecto, you get a perfectly dark, roasted bean with no off notes or milkiness to distract from the main event. Just damn fine coffee, as Agent Cooper would say. With a smoky vetiver and a touch of black, worn leather, we have no difficulty grasping the vision of the scent's creators here when they talk about living in the shoes of a rock star. Wearing this, we are suddenly drinking black coffee, watching the roadies rigging the sound equipment, breathing in the smell of warm, trampled grass, cigarette smoke, and the warm bodies of excited fans pressing close. Dark and straightforwardly masculine, this is what you wear when anticipation is a shape in the air.","coffee, vetiver, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,woody perfecto seemingly simple mix coffee vetiver leather something nailed fragrance hard keep grin face coffee difficult note pull woody perfecto get perfectly dark roasted bean notes milkiness distract main event damn fine coffee agent cooper would say smoky vetiver touch black worn leather difficulty grasping vision scent's creators talk living shoes rock star wearing suddenly drinking black coffee watching roadies rigging sound equipment breathing smell warm trampled grass cigarette smoke warm bodies excited fans pressing close dark straightforwardly masculine wear anticipation shape air,"coffee, vetiver, leather"
Satori Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"For her house's signature scent, Satori Osawa needed the perfect fusion of French and Japanese materials, techniques, and aesthetics, and yet her inspiration came from a precious ingredient derived from somewhere else entirely- Middle Eastern agarwood, or oud. And yet, the choice is perfect, as agarwood exemplifies the Japanese concept of ""five tastes"" exhibiting spicy, bitter, sweet, sour and salty facets all at once. A fragrance that fully encapsulates all five of these elements, Satori features a carefully selected suite of notes meant to complement each, with cinnamon and clove enhancing the spicy, cacao the bitter, vanilla the sweet, and bitter orange, oak moss and cypress for the sour and salty. Blended over a smooth, woody bed of sandalwood and frankincense, eastern and western elements converge with sublime balance, creating a gentle, warm and enveloping atmosphere. In this way, Satori is ultimately a fragrance that is universal but delightfully specific, where Japanese concepts become a global philosophy- elegant, romantic and enchanting.","bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,house's signature scent satori osawa needed perfect fusion french japanese materials techniques aesthetics yet inspiration came precious ingredient derived somewhere else entirely middle eastern agarwood oud yet choice perfect agarwood exemplifies japanese concept five tastes exhibiting spicy bitter sweet sour salty facets fragrance fully encapsulates five elements satori features carefully selected suite notes meant complement cinnamon clove enhancing spicy cacao bitter vanilla sweet bitter orange oak moss cypress sour salty blended smooth woody bed sandalwood frankincense eastern western elements converge sublime balance creating gentle warm enveloping atmosphere way satori ultimately fragrance universal delightfully specific japanese concepts become global philosophy elegant romantic enchanting,"bergamot, coriander, cinnamon, clove, cacao, vanilla, frankincense, sandalwood, oak moss, oud"
Iris Homme Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"The traditional arts of Japan are permeated with a dedication to simplicity- the idea that the more diligently and deliberately a flower is placed, or a brushstroke applied, the more significant it becomes. As a guiding principle for perfumery, it represents a departure from the operatic construction of European classics, and it is this principle that makes Iris Homme a deeply distinguished masculine of powerful subtlety. Iris Homme opens with bright, clarifying citrus, an authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast with an undercurrent of spicy cardamom that leads into the dry floral heart. The iris in question recalls MPG's classic Iris Bleu Gris in its clean, robust take on the note, but here the naturalism is slightly more incorporated, as an earthy violet and jasmine combination lingers softly but noticeably in the background. A warmly accessible base of ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple and long-lasting character, making this an ideal fragrance for situations formal and informal alike. Simplicity, after all, leaves ample room for interpretation.","lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76801.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,traditional arts japan permeated dedication simplicity idea diligently deliberately flower placed brushstroke applied significant becomes guiding principle perfumery represents departure operatic construction european classics principle makes iris homme deeply distinguished masculine powerful subtlety iris homme opens bright clarifying citrus authentically juicy lemon given masculine contrast undercurrent spicy cardamom leads dry floral heart iris question recalls mpg's classic iris bleu gris clean robust take note naturalism slightly incorporated earthy violet jasmine combination lingers softly noticeably background warmly accessible base ambered sandalwood provides appropriately simple long lasting character making ideal fragrance situations formal informal alike simplicity leaves ample room interpretation,"lemon, cardamom, orange flower, iris, violet, jasmine, amber, sandalwood, light musk"
Hana Hiraku Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"The Oriental category of perfumes has long been embellished by Western perfumers, constructing olfactory fantasies as seen from the outside. With Hana Hiraku, Satori Osawa deconstructs the Oriental, departing from what she calls the westernized 'glossy note' and, as a Japanese perfumer, creates a new category that she calls a ""Dry Oriental,"" defined by a more matte quality. In Hana Hiraku (or 'A Flower Blooms'), earthy, savory notes of miso and mitarashi, or sweet soy sauce, replace the animalic notes present in more Middle Eastern-style Oriental perfumes. The sensual, intoxicating quality of Oriental perfumery transforms into coolly understated je-ne-sais-quoi, like a romantic at arm's length. Hana Hiraku blooms first with a sweet, creamy musk melon, freshly cut with a salted knife. The honeydew is soft but prominent, and lifts up pale, watery magnolia flowers in all their green and aquatic glory. Quite distinctive is the addition of Japanese miso, which lends its uniquely briny, earthy umami quality to ground the floating magnolia. This union is actually not unusual in Japanese cuisine, where the large leaves of the magnolia tree are used as plates or for wrapping and baking miso or mochi rice cakes. This harmonious relationship reaches new heights with the sustained soft-focus cream of the melon, and achieves a sublime sensuality for the senses. This is no dripping or heavy scent, but rather it is perfume as seen through a frosted glass â diffuse, tender, and delicately blurred.","melon, bergamot, galbanum, magnolia, iris, jasmine, tuberose, rose, ylang-ylang, chamomile, miso, kogashi-shoyu, beeswax, sandalwood, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oriental category perfumes long embellished western perfumers constructing olfactory fantasies seen outside hana hiraku satori osawa deconstructs oriental departing calls westernized 'glossy note' japanese perfumer creates new category calls dry oriental defined matte quality hana hiraku 'a flower blooms' earthy savory notes miso mitarashi sweet soy sauce replace animalic notes present middle eastern style oriental perfumes sensual intoxicating quality oriental perfumery transforms coolly understated je ne sais quoi like romantic arm's length hana hiraku blooms first sweet creamy musk melon freshly cut salted knife honeydew soft prominent lifts pale watery magnolia flowers green aquatic glory quite distinctive addition japanese miso lends uniquely briny earthy umami quality ground floating magnolia union actually unusual japanese cuisine large leaves magnolia tree used plates wrapping baking miso mochi rice cakes harmonious relationship reaches new heights sustained soft focus cream melon achieves sublime sensuality senses dripping heavy scent rather perfume seen frosted glass diffuse tender delicately blurred,"melon, bergamot, galbanum, magnolia, iris, jasmine, tuberose, rose, ylang-ylang, chamomile, miso, kogashi-shoyu, beeswax, sandalwood, cedarwood"
Wasanbon Eau de Parfum,Parfum Satori,"Wasanbon is an intricate puzzle veiled in beguiling charm. Evoking Japanese tea-time, Wasanbon is a type of fine Japanese sugar hand-purified in multiple stages, used to make the highest class of delicate sugar candy. Perfumer Satori Osawa was tickled by its homonym in French, 'Wa sent bon' meaning 'Wa smells good' â Wa being the Japanese word for social harmony. Unlike the typical scent imagined from the concept of Wa, Wasanbon is mischievous, gliding into any situation with its sparkling confectionary charm, but slowly revealing the elegant, refined heart within. A tart, tangy lemon opens the fragrance, immediately uplifting, giddy on clouds. Not only is it sprinkled with crystalline sugar, but rounded out with juicy muscat grape, tart and sweet. These immediate fruits give way to a most delicate, pillowy melange of lightly honeyed mimosa flower, lily-of-the-valley, and the body of the fragrance, an exquisite wasanbon sugar, finely purified and crushed, sieved into the finest powder. A dusting of almond and vanilla only add to the heavenly delight of the senses. As the candy dissolves away, Wasanbon remains light and airy, lifted with an exquisite iris and soft, velvety guaiacwood. What could be more charming?","lemon, muscat, mimosa, muguet, almond, sugar, honey, vanilla, iris, guaiacwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76803.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,wasanbon intricate puzzle veiled beguiling charm evoking japanese tea time wasanbon type fine japanese sugar hand purified multiple stages used make highest class delicate sugar candy perfumer satori osawa tickled homonym french 'wa sent bon' meaning 'wa smells good' wa japanese word social harmony unlike typical scent imagined concept wa wasanbon mischievous gliding situation sparkling confectionary charm slowly revealing elegant refined heart within tart tangy lemon opens fragrance immediately uplifting giddy clouds sprinkled crystalline sugar rounded juicy muscat grape tart sweet immediate fruits give way delicate pillowy melange lightly honeyed mimosa flower lily valley body fragrance exquisite wasanbon sugar finely purified crushed sieved finest powder dusting almond vanilla add heavenly delight senses candy dissolves away wasanbon remains light airy lifted exquisite iris soft velvety guaiacwood could charming,"lemon, muscat, mimosa, muguet, almond, sugar, honey, vanilla, iris, guaiacwood"
Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto Extrait de Parfum,UNUM,"Io Non Ho Mani Che Mi Accarezzino il Volto - ""There are no hands / to caress my face."" This is the beginning of a 1948 poem by Father David Maria Turoldo, which the Italian photographer Mario Giacomelli took as the name for a photography series in the early 1960s. It's these photos that serve as the inspiration for UNUM's founder and artist Filippo Sorcinelli's new fragrance. The photos are striking: disarming images of young priests in states of joyous movement, dancing and playing. The fragrance is an olfactory rendering of the stunning imagery, capturing the humanity beneath the black cassocks. The fragrance opens with a fizzy glow of crackling petitgrain and bergamot, which lifts up to reveal the heart: a breathtaking wall of scent, flawlessly blended cedar with spice, like cinnamon, and clary sage, ylang ylang, and resins. The drydown evokes what we imagine the seminary could have been, its stone walled building resonating with sandalwood, rituals cloaked in incense and benzoin, and the warm puff of tobacco. It transports you into Giacomelli's photographs of the clergymen smoking cigars - when the rector saw these images, it was the last straw, and Giacomelli was prevented from ever photographing at the seminary again.","petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/71906.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,io non ho mani che mi accarezzino il volto hands / caress face beginning poem father david maria turoldo italian photographer mario giacomelli took name photography series early photos serve inspiration unum's founder artist filippo sorcinelli's new fragrance photos striking disarming images young priests states joyous movement dancing playing fragrance olfactory rendering stunning imagery capturing humanity beneath black cassocks fragrance opens fizzy glow crackling petitgrain bergamot lifts reveal heart breathtaking wall scent flawlessly blended cedar spice like cinnamon clary sage ylang ylang resins drydown evokes imagine seminary could stone walled building resonating sandalwood rituals cloaked incense benzoin warm puff tobacco transports giacomelli's photographs clergymen smoking cigars rector saw images last straw giacomelli prevented ever photographing seminary,"petitgrain, bergamot, galbanum, myrrh, cedar, geranium, clary sage, cinnamon, styrax, ylang-ylang, incense, benzoin, tonka bean, tobacco, amber, sandalwood"
Black Phantom Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Through a glass, darkly. Black Phantom is a unisex woody gourmand that will please just about everyone. Its topnotes have a dangerous glitter to them, like a glass of rum rimmed in cane sugar set alight, sending sparks of roasted nuts, caramel, booze, and smoke out into the night air. Once the boozy fireflies have dimmed a little, a gentler accord begins to bloom â a wonderfully soft, nutty sandalwood that reminds us of caramelized pain de mie dipped into warm milk. But despite all the foodie notes, Black Phantom is not thick or heavy. Shot through with wisps of woodsmoke, resin, and roasted coffee, Black Phantom is clearly a gourmand aimed at more adult tastes. Imagine a cozy Parisian cafe on a cold, rainy day. You are reading a book and sipping a milky coffee with a drop of rum on the side to warm your bones. Delicious aromas of pralines, fresh pastries, chocolate, toasted nuts, and coffee melt waft over the papery vanilla smell of your book and the bitter almond posies of heliotrope on each table. Now imagine the undertow of a really good sandalwood that smells like salty butter and sweet cream. It really doesn't get better than this if you love grown-up, unisex gourmands.","rum, sugar cane, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, almond, heliotrope, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/425011.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,glass darkly black phantom unisex woody gourmand please everyone topnotes dangerous glitter like glass rum rimmed cane sugar set alight sending sparks roasted nuts caramel booze smoke night air boozy fireflies dimmed little gentler accord begins bloom wonderfully soft nutty sandalwood reminds us caramelized pain de mie dipped warm milk despite foodie notes black phantom thick heavy shot wisps woodsmoke resin roasted coffee black phantom clearly gourmand aimed adult tastes imagine cozy parisian cafe cold rainy day reading book sipping milky coffee drop rum side warm bones delicious aromas pralines fresh pastries chocolate toasted nuts coffee melt waft papery vanilla smell book bitter almond posies heliotrope table imagine undertow really good sandalwood smells like salty butter sweet cream really get better love grown unisex gourmands,"rum, sugar cane, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, almond, heliotrope, sandalwood"

Bracken Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Inspired by 1960s counterculture, Bracken is an elegantly wild concoction for the modern hippie. A smoky, herbal potion with sweet woodland flowers and wild berries, Bracken Woman opens with a delicious clash of ferny green notes and tangy red fruit juices. Then, a rush of herbal and floral aromas tumble together for a love-in with smoky, birchy leather. In the middle stage, the loamy aroma of damp earth is joined by patchouli, and the florals intensify, giving an impression of moist tobacco and crushed blossoms.
Bracken Woman eventually relaxes into a woody green floral. But it stays very much a creature of the forest: earthy, verdant and more than a bit mysterious.

London Eau de Parfum,Gallivant,"London- a massive city that sometimes feels like a small town. Soaring buildings abut down-to-earth pubs. Overwhelming, but inexplicably addictive. And, as much as the Brits have a well-earned reputation for stuffiness, it's all tied together with a wicked sense of humor. Where else can you find such a sea of humanity, east end boys and west end girls in second-hand leather jackets, the creative, the new, old, the beautiful, the ugly, the rich and the poor, all just rubbing along and making their way in one of the world's true capitals? Gallivant presents a particularly unique olfactive portrait of London- a wet spring, where roses from Columbia Rd. radiate from courtyard gardens, bouncing off the dustiness of Georgian architecture, embracing an earthy lush wetness that makes it feel as if the city grew organically from British soil. Richly floral, deeply intoxicating, London is the spirit of the United Kingdom.","cucumber, violet leaves, rose de mai, rose oil, orris root, leather, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,london massive city sometimes feels like small town soaring buildings abut earth pubs overwhelming inexplicably addictive much brits well earned reputation stuffiness tied together wicked sense humor else find sea humanity east end boys west end girls second hand leather jackets creative new old beautiful ugly rich poor rubbing along making way one world's true capitals gallivant presents particularly unique olfactive portrait london wet spring roses columbia rd radiate courtyard gardens bouncing dustiness georgian architecture embracing earthy lush wetness makes feel city grew organically british soil richly floral deeply intoxicating london spirit united kingdom,"cucumber, violet leaves, rose de mai, rose oil, orris root, leather, sandalwood, patchouli, cedar"
Tel Aviv Eau de Parfum,Gallivant,"A true mixture of Mediterranean elegance, modern Middle East heat, and cosmopolitan cool, Tel Aviv is like nowhere else on Earth. It's bright white sun, gold jewelry on tanned skin, a lingering 1970's glamour. It's sexy, it's a party, it's life in the bubble. It's walking along the beach, naked skin, feeling relaxed, with the big city bustling right next door, full of noise, people and mad intensity. it's stopping at the juice stall on Dizengoff, smelling the fresh clementines and sweet stone fruits. It's the heat, the sweat, the cigarette smoke, and the sweet florals from the overhead balconies, all sewn together with the warm musk of human flesh and youthful energy.","clementine, bergamot, blackcurrant bud, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, rose oil, freesia, sandalwood, musk, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,true mixture mediterranean elegance modern middle east heat cosmopolitan cool tel aviv like nowhere else earth bright white sun gold jewelry tanned skin lingering 's glamour sexy party life bubble walking along beach naked skin feeling relaxed big city bustling right next door full noise people mad intensity stopping juice stall dizengoff smelling fresh clementines sweet stone fruits heat sweat cigarette smoke sweet florals overhead balconies sewn together warm musk human flesh youthful energy,"clementine, bergamot, blackcurrant bud, jasmine sambac, ylang-ylang, rose oil, freesia, sandalwood, musk, benzoin"
La Tosca Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Casamorati,"Shockingly violent, sweeping and modern when it premiered, Puccini's Tosca was a true spectacle, drawing heated and mixed critical reaction- and the absolute adoration of the public, who flocked to its every sold-out performance. Having already been transformed into an Italian-language opera from a French-language play, Tosca's further transformation into a perfume with cross-border influence seems all too appropriate, and so it may come as no surprise that it's a crowd-pleasing success- a colorful, broadly painted grand-dame floral mixing freshness and lusciousness, bright herbal tones and smooth vanilla creaminess, for a truly romantic work of art. Many fragrances claim to be operatic, but Tosca, with its crisp and green citrus opening, herbaceous floral heart, and rich drydown, really does feel like a scent in three distinct, yet connected, acts, guiding us on an ever-moving emotional journey that twists, turns, and ultimately uplifts the spirit.","lemon, green manadarin, rose, eucalyptus, violet leaves, patchouli, musk, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67412.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,shockingly violent sweeping modern premiered puccini's tosca true spectacle drawing heated mixed critical reaction absolute adoration public flocked every sold performance already transformed italian language opera french language play tosca's transformation perfume cross border influence seems appropriate may come surprise crowd pleasing success colorful broadly painted grand dame floral mixing freshness lusciousness bright herbal tones smooth vanilla creaminess truly romantic work art many fragrances claim operatic tosca crisp green citrus opening herbaceous floral heart rich drydown really feel like scent three distinct yet connected acts guiding us ever moving emotional journey twists turns ultimately uplifts spirit,"lemon, green manadarin, rose, eucalyptus, violet leaves, patchouli, musk, amber, vanilla"
Mirabilis Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Elegant in its simplicity, Mirabilis is the Natura Fabularis collection's and perfumer Daphne Bugey's attempt to tackle one of man's deepest questions- nature vs science- with a clever, fragrant twist. Here, the debate between the rational and the spiritual plays out in Bugey's choice of ingredients, with the natural world represented first via a rich, gently earthy incense, the most fundamental of all perfume ingredients, recalling ancient devotionals and primal understandings. Then, the scientific comes into focus, combining the comforting cleanness of Ambrox with Vulcanolide, a cutting edge synthetic musk with earthy and amber facets. The result is a fragrance that wears lightly, but not weakly- there's an elemental power beneath the surface, humming with clean energy, but also just enough earthiness to never fully leave the natural realm. Part rational, part spiritual, Mirabilis is a true reconciliation between reason and belief.

Arcana Rosa Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"There's no shortage of pithy phrases involving roses and thorns, but you'd never know it by smelling the bland softness of most mass market rose fragrances. Luckily, Arcana Rosa's thorns are front and center, hardened over an open cedar fire and spiked with rooty vetiver and prickly cade. Through the smoke, a lush, beautifully full bodied Bulgarian rose still asserts its beauty, but the woods and resins transmute its strength into something of awe and danger, a rose equally at home on a man or woman. We're not surprised that the Natura Fabularis collection needed a rose. We're simply grateful that they decided that they decided that the same old rose just wouldn't do.

Tenebrae Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Tenebrae, as the official text from the Natura Fabularis collection describes it, is the scent of a ""dark and shadowy forest"" so overgrown that light barely peeks through the treetops, and we certainly wouldn't disagree. But in true fairy tale fashion, this forest hides not only mysterious dangers, represented with dark resins and woods, but also mystical wonders, in the form of a marvelously sweet and complex crystallized sap note that combines with a not-too-heavy dose of incense. The result is a fragrance that lifts us upwards, letting us know that the sun is still there, even if we can't quite see it.

You Or Someone Like You Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"If Etat Libre d'Orange had set out specifically to make a fragrance that would delight us here at Luckyscent, they still probably couldn't top You Or Someone Like You. Dedicated to our hometown of Los Angeles? Check. Creative directed by our good friend and collaborator Chandler Burr and named after his L.A.-based novel? Check. And most importantly, the kind of fresh, crisply cool niche scent that's oh so wonderfully easy to wear in any situation, yet distinct and head-turning? In a city where deals are made poolside and boardroom meetings might feature more denim than Italian wool, that's a big, important check. While they're keeping the official notes a secret, we're buzzing off You Or Someone Like You's sharp, fruity opening and ultra-fresh mint and floral body--it really does evoke one of our favorite L.A. experiences- sipping a drink on the wraparound balcony of a party palace in the hills, taking in our big, weird, wonderful city.

Violaceum Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"It takes all of a second for the beauty of a flower to topple over in the darkness. Composed for L'Artisan Parfumeur's exclusive collection, Natura Fabularis, Violaceum pays tribute to the ephemeral character of nature. In the shade of a forest lies a carpet of violets. Despite their delicate nature, these flowers are not prone to sentimentality. The usually powdery sensation is replaced by an impression of leather. The perfumer, Daphne Bugey, creates confusion and depth by combining the violet, cousin of the iris, to an accord of carrot and saffron. A simple flower can no longer be perceived, and instead, a complex and poetic blend comes together, where gastronomy and the floral arts meet in two distinct new accords: carrot-saffron and leathery-violet. As Violaceum deepens on the skin, it resonates with poetic clarity- classic and contemporary all at once.

Venenum Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Somewhere between gourmand and oriental, exotic and comforting, light and dark, lies Venenum, the Natura Fabularis collection's ode to the beautiful aromas and ingredients of India. Blending captivating notes of deep, smooth sandalwood, milky and spicy chai tea, and steamed rice, Venenum is an intriguing chameleon, oscillating between the mouthwatering and the romantic with delightful playfulness, conjuring broadly painted visions of sunsets over Lake Pichola and elaborately lovely high tea ceremonies, adventures as relaxing as they are exciting.

Feu Secret Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"Of the four grades of fire with which the ancient alchemists worked, the primary one for the true alchemist was the Secret Fire â the fire that was able to affect matter without having a physical presence itself. It is the 'serpentine working power in the body,' the electro-spiritual, creative life force of the alchemist himself. The acclaimed artist-perfumer Bruno Fazzolari has brought the secret fire to life in this shape-shifting ode to the orris root. Feu Secret opens with a bright-cold burst of pink pepper and eucalyptus that lifts the orris root to the sun, almost mimicking a citrus note. This is no earthy-cold iris â if anything, the spices bring out the hidden warmth of the orris butter, melting into the skin. The transformative nature of the iris comes out in the heart, not lipstick-violet in any mortal way, but ethereally smoky, reaching its roots into the earth. Reducing all other attempts at rooty orris to mere sweet carrots, rising tendrils of birch tar smoke give way to a gauzy, woody veil, enthroned in vanilla and cedar. The vibrant life energy is properly interpreted here, by turns airy, fiery, and earthy on the skin. As a divine incantation, Feu Secret is surprisingly androgynous and sublimely distinctive.","hemlock spruce, eucalyptus, iris, turmeric, pink pepper, cedar, birch tar, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69308.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,four grades fire ancient alchemists worked primary one true alchemist secret fire fire able affect matter without physical presence 'serpentine working power body ' electro spiritual creative life force alchemist acclaimed artist perfumer bruno fazzolari brought secret fire life shape shifting ode orris root feu secret opens bright cold burst pink pepper eucalyptus lifts orris root sun almost mimicking citrus note earthy cold iris anything spices bring hidden warmth orris butter melting skin transformative nature iris comes heart lipstick violet mortal way ethereally smoky reaching roots earth reducing attempts rooty orris mere sweet carrots rising tendrils birch tar smoke give way gauzy woody veil enthroned vanilla cedar vibrant life energy properly interpreted turns airy fiery earthy skin divine incantation feu secret surprisingly androgynous sublimely distinctive,"hemlock spruce, eucalyptus, iris, turmeric, pink pepper, cedar, birch tar, vanilla"

Cypress Shade Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"More shade than cypress, Cypress Shade is so astonishingly good at capturing the cool, herbal dampness of the ground under a cypress tree that you might want to curl up and take a little nap. Take a good book with you, and a glass of ice-cold Pastis.
The mastic woodiness of the cypress does not dominate, forming instead a softly green, balsamic curtain through which the other notes shine. Fresh mint, vetiver, and coriander form a cooling mat of aromatic grasses that is as welcome on a hot day as a cool cloth on the forehead. The unmistakable licorice snap of anise darts and weaves through the damp green notes, turning the mind most pleasurably to the midday aperitif. But what elevates this scent beyond the standard woody aromatic is the mimosa, a powdery yellow flower that smells like almond flour, glue, cucumber, and innocence itself. The mimosa sparkles before folding itself into a vigorous base of Madagascaran cedar and Haitian vetiver. It ends, as all things should, in the milky, anise-tinted blur of Pastis.","lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76404.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,shade cypress cypress shade astonishingly good capturing cool herbal dampness ground cypress tree might want curl take little nap take good book glass ice cold pastis mastic woodiness cypress dominate forming instead softly green balsamic curtain notes shine fresh mint vetiver coriander form cooling mat aromatic grasses welcome hot day cool cloth forehead unmistakable licorice snap anise darts weaves damp green notes turning mind pleasurably midday aperitif elevates scent beyond standard woody aromatic mimosa powdery yellow flower smells like almond flour glue cucumber innocence mimosa sparkles folding vigorous base madagascaran cedar haitian vetiver ends things milky anise tinted blur pastis,"lemon, bergamot, badiane, mandarin, petitgrain, mimosa, coriander, mint, cedar, vetiver, oud"
Dates Delight Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Are you the kind of person who looks at the dessert list before choosing the appetizers? Well, then welcome to the most sumptuous dessert trolley you've ever set eyes on â Dates Delight. Imagine a gold dish piled high with sticky RiyÃ  dates as plump as a baby's fist and dripping with raw honey and caramel. Now picture them dunked into a bath of the silkiest creme brulee, thick with vanilla bean underneath and crackling with melted brown sugar on top. Visualize all this dusted with a thick layer of spicy cinnamon. Are you salivating yet? Thankfully, although this scent is delicious it stops short of total gluttony because of the inedible elements at play. So while the honey and dates may make your mouth water, the coumarin, with its nuances of warm, pungent hay, bitter almonds, and tobacco makes you hesitate to put it in your mouth. Benzoin and labdanum add smoke, leather, and a hint of tar that reins it in even further. Even the soapy little peony note up top whispers, don't eat me. It's this level of abstraction that balances the scent, and renders it sophisticated. Fans of Oajan by Parfums de Marly and Ambre Narguile by Hermes will feel right at home here.","peony, dates, coumarin, caramel, tonka, cinnamon, honey, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla, sugar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kind person looks dessert list choosing appetizers well welcome sumptuous dessert trolley ever set eyes dates delight imagine gold dish piled high sticky riy dates plump baby's fist dripping raw honey caramel picture dunked bath silkiest creme brulee thick vanilla bean underneath crackling melted brown sugar top visualize dusted thick layer spicy cinnamon salivating yet thankfully although scent delicious stops short total gluttony inedible elements play honey dates may make mouth water coumarin nuances warm pungent hay bitter almonds tobacco makes hesitate put mouth benzoin labdanum add smoke leather hint tar reins even even soapy little peony note top whispers eat level abstraction balances scent renders sophisticated fans oajan parfums de marly ambre narguile hermes feel right home,"peony, dates, coumarin, caramel, tonka, cinnamon, honey, labdanum, benzoin, vanilla, sugar"
Golden Powder Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Although strictly speaking the name Golden Powder refers to a meditation technique that opens up the chest to rays of chakra-cleansing light, we kind of prefer to think that the name really is a sly nod to those famous 'golden dust' attars for which the Middle East and India are famous â beautifully warm, resinous ambers with nuances of tobacco, cinnamon, and vanilla-soaked wood.
Golden Powder is a luxury rendition of this oriental theme, taking it to a richer, more refined level. The first impression is of dry woods, flurries of dusty cinnamon and nutmeg swirling around tough Virginian cedar and robust tobacco leaf. But then a cinnamon-apple amber and golden vanilla swells up from underneath, folding the woods, tobacco, and spice into a room-filling crescendo of creamy sweetness. Oriental, yes, but as user-friendly as a Golden Retriever. Fans of Kalemat and Raghba looking for an upgrade may want to try this on for size.","nutmeg, cinnamon, sandalwood, guaiac wood, cedar, papyrus, musk, labdanum, vanilla, coumarin, tobacco blossom",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76406.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,although strictly speaking name golden powder refers meditation technique opens chest rays chakra cleansing light kind prefer think name really sly nod famous 'golden dust' attars middle east india famous beautifully warm resinous ambers nuances tobacco cinnamon vanilla soaked wood golden powder luxury rendition oriental theme taking richer refined level first impression dry woods flurries dusty cinnamon nutmeg swirling around tough virginian cedar robust tobacco leaf cinnamon apple amber golden vanilla swells underneath folding woods tobacco spice room filling crescendo creamy sweetness oriental yes user friendly golden retriever fans kalemat raghba looking upgrade may want try size,"nutmeg, cinnamon, sandalwood, guaiac wood, cedar, papyrus, musk, labdanum, vanilla, coumarin, tobacco blossom"
Grape Pearls Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Oh my. Intense Cafe met Botrytis and they made a baby. A stunning 'fall harvest' fragrance, Grape Pearls strikes a perfect balance between the honeyed freshness of flowers and the earthier smells of the land as it gives up its yield. The opening notes of fruit and red wine transport us to the packing shed, where the crates of freshly-picked grapes are stacked one on top of another. These smell of ripe grapes and red berries, but also of wine must, honey, and old wood - olfactory memories of the harvests of yesteryear.

Blessing Silence Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"The age-old pairing of rose, oud, and patchouli....you might have heard this tune before, but when it's done as right as Blessing Silence, it's as revelatory as listening to a Justin Bieber tune sung by Placido Domingo. Good materials make all the difference. Right out of the gate, you notice the tight balance between four big power players â the deeply tarry, leathery labdanum, the burning oud chip note, the beefy rose, and the pungent patchouli. The powerful notes try at first to duke it out, each hoping to emerge as alpha dog, but in the end, they call a truce. What emerges from the tussle is an incredibly rich, oozing animalic accord of earth, rot, smoke, rose, leather, and resin. It's an aroma as ancient as perfume itself, a word which, after all, means 'through the smoke'. One sniff of this heavenly potion and you will be whisked away to a Sultan's palace where they are fumigating his robes and rooms with Kyara from the jungles of Vietnam.

Breath Of The Infinite Eau de Parfum,The House Of Oud,"Inspired by that tremulous moment when our world first came to be, Breath of the Infinite is an attempt to capture in fragrance form the smell of space particles and stars colliding in an explosion so colossal that it makes the universe contract and hold its breath. The fragrance itself is as cloudy and as abstract as the aftermath.
It's not an easy one to describe. A mixture of peppery, raw ambroxan and woody musk forms a nebulous background against which tiny starbursts of peony and freesia pop like soap bubbles. It feels both as spare and modern as a Giacometti sculpture, and as ancient as a piece of driftwood on the beach. Black pepper, metal, dust, salt, wood, and the sensuous, latex-like slip of cashmeran in the base â as elemental as time itself. If you love scents like L'Antimatiere that keep you guessing, then head on over to the ultra-mysterious Breath of the Infinite.","peony, freesia, peach, musk, ambroxan, cashmeran, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired tremulous moment world first came breath infinite attempt capture fragrance form smell space particles stars colliding explosion colossal makes universe contract hold breath fragrance cloudy abstract aftermath easy one describe mixture peppery raw ambroxan woody musk forms nebulous background tiny starbursts peony freesia pop like soap bubbles feels spare modern giacometti sculpture ancient piece driftwood beach black pepper metal dust salt wood sensuous latex like slip cashmeran base elemental time love scents like l'antimatiere keep guessing head ultra mysterious breath infinite,"peony, freesia, peach, musk, ambroxan, cashmeran, oud"
Clandestine Clara Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"Rebellious, contradictory, independent, unconventional- these are the words Penhaligon's uses to describe Clara, the latest character in their Portraits saga- the illicit mistress to Lord George. And true to form, Clara's fragrance could be described much the same way, as a boozy, smoky, smoothly woodsy feminine scent that's not for the faint of heart, but is sure to command the attention of sophisticated thrill-seekers. Spicy and sweet in equal measure, Clandestine Clara layered rich, smooth rhum vanilla over musky cinnamon, creating a true gourmand that nonetheless never feels simple, dessert-y or girlish- due, perhaps, to the complex ambered patchouli in the base. Is Clandestine Clara a challenging fragrance? We'd have to say so- but as Lord George can confirm, it's a challenge bound to seduce.","rhum vanilla, cinnamon musk, amber, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/441019.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rebellious contradictory independent unconventional words penhaligon's uses describe clara latest character portraits saga illicit mistress lord george true form clara's fragrance could described much way boozy smoky smoothly woodsy feminine scent that's faint heart sure command attention sophisticated thrill seekers spicy sweet equal measure clandestine clara layered rich smooth rhum vanilla musky cinnamon creating true gourmand nonetheless never feels simple dessert girlish due perhaps complex ambered patchouli base clandestine clara challenging fragrance we'd say lord george confirm challenge bound seduce,"rhum vanilla, cinnamon musk, amber, patchouli"

Rhinoceros Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Across the savanna, in the dry heat of midday, aromas of parched grasses and campfire woods crackle in the arid air. A stir of something densely animalic causes nearby sandpipers to lift their heads in alarm. The rhino lowers his head, and smaller creatures scatter.
Rhinoceros is an animalic fougere that charges in headfirst with uncompromisingly butch notes of tannic leather and rum. But this rough beast hides a gentlemanly heart. The rough, raw leather of the opening is gradually smoothed out by herbal-tonic notes of lavender, sage and geranium. Leaving the African veldt for a wood-paneled library, our horned friend invites us to settle down with a leather-bound volume and a pipe of rich, moist tobacco. A bit fierce when you first meet him, Rhinoceros shows himself to be a creature of great refinement.","rum, bergamot, lavender, elemi, sage, armoise, conifer needles, pinewood, tobacco, immortelle, geranium, agarwood, cedar, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, smoke, leather, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,across savanna dry heat midday aromas parched grasses campfire woods crackle arid air stir something densely animalic causes nearby sandpipers lift heads alarm rhino lowers head smaller creatures scatter rhinoceros animalic fougere charges headfirst uncompromisingly butch notes tannic leather rum rough beast hides gentlemanly heart rough raw leather opening gradually smoothed herbal tonic notes lavender sage geranium leaving african veldt wood paneled library horned friend invites us settle leather bound volume pipe rich moist tobacco bit fierce first meet rhinoceros shows creature great refinement,"rum, bergamot, lavender, elemi, sage, armoise, conifer needles, pinewood, tobacco, immortelle, geranium, agarwood, cedar, vetiver, sandalwood, amber, smoke, leather, musk"
Macaque Eau de Parfum,Zoologist,"Macaque, that most playful of primates, starts with a bit of mischief. Tangy, off-sweet mandarin and green apple run smack into a startlingly vibrant galbanum that picks them up and shakes them by the scruff. But before the galbanum can get the upper hand, the fruit is bolstered by grassy green and jasmine teas and a rather serious cedar, which calms the bite of the galbanum. At this stage, Macaque seems to be an on its way to becoming an eccentrically fetching green perfume. But what happens next makes Macaque a true original.
The vivid fruit and green notes spread out, becoming less opaque, as ceremonial aromas of smoky incense and oud start to rise. Macaque transforms from impish volley between tree fruit and vegetation to a dialogue between the contemplative and spiritual and the primal. In the dry-down, mossy and woody aromas meld with the bright notes of Macaque's opening, creating an interplay of wildness and meditative that is as provocative as it is soothing.","cedar, green apple, red mandarin, frankincense, galbanum, honey, rosewood, ylang-ylang, jasmine tea, cedarmoss, green tea, white oud, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,macaque playful primates starts bit mischief tangy sweet mandarin green apple run smack startlingly vibrant galbanum picks shakes scruff galbanum get upper hand fruit bolstered grassy green jasmine teas rather serious cedar calms bite galbanum stage macaque seems way becoming eccentrically fetching green perfume happens next makes macaque true original vivid fruit green notes spread becoming less opaque ceremonial aromas smoky incense oud start rise macaque transforms impish volley tree fruit vegetation dialogue contemplative spiritual primal dry mossy woody aromas meld bright notes macaque's opening creating interplay wildness meditative provocative soothing,"cedar, green apple, red mandarin, frankincense, galbanum, honey, rosewood, ylang-ylang, jasmine tea, cedarmoss, green tea, white oud, musk"
Nightingale Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"If the thickest fuchsia silk could be encapsulated in perfume, it would smell like Nightingale, Zoologist's floral chypre. A startlingly beautiful Japanese plum blossom top note is supported by a deeply lush rose and fresh green violet. Balanced by spritely citrus and woody notes, Nightingale soars between airy and opulent.
As Nightingale trills her eloquent flowery song, nighttime fragrances of incense and light oud permeate the composition, lending a mysterious, twilight quality. In the dry down, oakmoss and patchouli brings the scents of ancient trees and damp earth as Nightingale's serenade quiets. Sensual, rich and serenely lovely, Nightingale is a rare bird.","bergamot, lemon, saffron, plum blossom, rose, violet, oud, patchouli, sandalwood, moss, frankincense, white musk, labdanum, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,thickest fuchsia silk could encapsulated perfume would smell like nightingale zoologist's floral chypre startlingly beautiful japanese plum blossom top note supported deeply lush rose fresh green violet balanced spritely citrus woody notes nightingale soars airy opulent nightingale trills eloquent flowery song nighttime fragrances incense light oud permeate composition lending mysterious twilight quality dry oakmoss patchouli brings scents ancient trees damp earth nightingale's serenade quiets sensual rich serenely lovely nightingale rare bird,"bergamot, lemon, saffron, plum blossom, rose, violet, oud, patchouli, sandalwood, moss, frankincense, white musk, labdanum, ambergris"
Hummingbird Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"Nectarous honeysuckle and yellow mimosa flutter in the air to the beat of a thousand tiny wings, their honeyed bouquet summoning tiny, extravagant birds to feed. Moments later, crystalline muguet, lilac and peony begin to float around trees heavy with fruit, as birds and insects buzz dizzily in the morning heat. Hummingbird, Zoologist's ode to the jeweled avian, is a lovely floral that, like its namesake, is at once sumptuous and ethereal. As it opens, a giddy host of spring flowers swirls around rich honeyed notes. Pears and green plums, dripping with sweet juice, tantalize as Hummingbird's blooms open in quick succession, each flower's characteristics instantly recognizable.

Beaver Eau de Parfum,Zoologist,"A dewy, saturated green floral with aquatic notes, Beaver is a serene drift down a lazy river. The honeyed richness of linden blossoms floats deliriously over bracing ozonic notes, as Beaver sets out on its languid journey. Then, a strange, complex green note, half vegetation, half herbal and utterly compelling, swims up through the linden. Beaver becomes lusher, linden mingling with scents of driftwood and foliage.
As it moves downstream towards the base notes, Beaver changes tide, its watery notes receding in favor of animalic aspects. Smooth, sueded leather emerges and mingles with soft, furry musks and a tang of castoreum as Beaver reveals a more wanton side. Verdant, refined and just this side of lusty, Beaver turns out to be the naughtiest green floral we've encountered for some time.","linden blossom, fresh outdoor air, wood shavings, wild vegetation, damp air, dry wood, water, musk, dark woods, vanilla, amber, castoreum, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dewy saturated green floral aquatic notes beaver serene drift lazy river honeyed richness linden blossoms floats deliriously bracing ozonic notes beaver sets languid journey strange complex green note half vegetation half herbal utterly compelling swims linden beaver becomes lusher linden mingling scents driftwood foliage moves downstream towards base notes beaver changes tide watery notes receding favor animalic aspects smooth sueded leather emerges mingles soft furry musks tang castoreum beaver reveals wanton side verdant refined side lusty beaver turns naughtiest green floral we've encountered time,"linden blossom, fresh outdoor air, wood shavings, wild vegetation, damp air, dry wood, water, musk, dark woods, vanilla, amber, castoreum, leather"
Civet Extrait de Parfum,Zoologist,"An homage to the ingredient that gave that deliciously naughty, animalic note to the great elegant perfumes of the 30s and 40s, such as Rochas Femme and Schiaparelli Shocking, Civet is a gorgeous retro-style chypre. Civet's zingy opening makes her seem like a modern gal, thanks to a vigorous citrus-pepper top note and herbal bite. Then, a plethora of heady floral notes swan in: heliotrope, linden, and hyacinth, creating a perfume of almost unbearable loveliness.
Civet could have stopped right there and remained breathtakingly pretty. But she has darker motives and starts to undress, revealing her voluptuousness with fleshy ylang ylang and tuberose. That animalic touch of those yesteryear beauties is there as you would expect, and gives Civet its low growl. But a slow-blooming, deep red carnation lends Civet its vintage charm. The spicy flower opens up in the middle stages, revealing a classically pretty bloom, creamy with hints of clove and green stem. When it finally stretches out on a gourmand bed of coffee, vanilla and incense, Civet purrs like a contented kitten.","bergamot, black pepper, lemon, orange, spices, tarragon, carnation, frangipani, heliotrope, hyacinth, linden blossom, tuberose, ylang-ylang, balsams, civet, coffee, incense, labdanum, musk, oakmoss, resins, russian leather, vanilla, vetiver, woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/76002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,homage ingredient gave deliciously naughty animalic note great elegant perfumes rochas femme schiaparelli shocking civet gorgeous retro style chypre civet's zingy opening makes seem like modern gal thanks vigorous citrus pepper top note herbal bite plethora heady floral notes swan heliotrope linden hyacinth creating perfume almost unbearable loveliness civet could stopped right remained breathtakingly pretty darker motives starts undress revealing voluptuousness fleshy ylang ylang tuberose animalic touch yesteryear beauties would expect gives civet low growl slow blooming deep red carnation lends civet vintage charm spicy flower opens middle stages revealing classically pretty bloom creamy hints clove green stem finally stretches gourmand bed coffee vanilla incense civet purrs like contented kitten,"bergamot, black pepper, lemon, orange, spices, tarragon, carnation, frangipani, heliotrope, hyacinth, linden blossom, tuberose, ylang-ylang, balsams, civet, coffee, incense, labdanum, musk, oakmoss, resins, russian leather, vanilla, vetiver, woods"

Kismet Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"""Folly!"" That's how the elderly owner of the Lubin Perfume House, Monsieur Paul Prot, described the elephant-shaped perfume bottle that had appeared on his desk. It had been designed for a princess. Spiritual and multilingual, Kismet cultivated the mystery surrounding her background. She reigned over the Parisian parties of the Roaring Twenties for a time, then one day slipped away, never to be seen again. All that remained was the memory of the scent that Lubin had created for her.
And what a scent it is- lush and heady, sweet and intoxicating, wedding the vivacious freshness of bergamot, lemon and nose-tingling petitgrain to a velvety menagerie of exquisite types of rose, all set against smooth, creamy vanilla and sumptuously sensual patchouli and myrrh. Like the now faded-to-legend princess, this Kismet is at once seductive and delightful, exotic and familiar, and altogether ravishing. Another touch of vintage elegance from the house of Lubin.","bergamot, lemon, petitgrain, rose centifolia, rose, patchouli, labdanum cistus, opoponax, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,folly that's elderly owner lubin perfume house monsieur paul prot described elephant shaped perfume bottle appeared desk designed princess spiritual multilingual kismet cultivated mystery surrounding background reigned parisian parties roaring twenties time one day slipped away never seen remained memory scent lubin created scent lush heady sweet intoxicating wedding vivacious freshness bergamot lemon nose tingling petitgrain velvety menagerie exquisite types rose set smooth creamy vanilla sumptuously sensual patchouli myrrh like faded legend princess kismet seductive delightful exotic familiar altogether ravishing another touch vintage elegance house lubin,"bergamot, lemon, petitgrain, rose centifolia, rose, patchouli, labdanum cistus, opoponax, vanilla"

Bass Solo Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince,"Inspired by Wendge, the beautifully dark-grained African wood whose dense timber makes it coveted for the crafting of musical instruments, Bass Solo, the newest scent from The Vagabond Prince, is truly a virtuosic work. While Wenge doesn't have an aroma of its own, its combination of beauty and function inspired master perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour to fashion a fragrance that itself extracts deep and vibrant accords hidden within its notes. Like the profound resonance of the titular instrument, Bass Solo offers an aroma pitched in the lowest register, its dense melody composed of a selection of exquisite woody notes including soft sandalwood, salty driftwood, and a blend of cedars with warm, comfortable, dry nuances. Smoky tar and velvety peach flow through the striations, while a light floral cardamom combines with the woodsy warmth to softly caress the wearer. Meanwhile a higher pich of lavender represents the cold metal of the strings, bringing spice and wood together to create magic. Sleek yet deep, beautiful yet powerful, Bass Solo represents a bold new evolution for The Vagabond Prince, and is as striking a scent as we've encountered all year.","saffron, ginger, lime, cardamom, lavender, cedar, cedar, fig milk, birch tar, sandalwood, amber, driftwood, wenge accord, musk, oppoponax, amyris, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired wendge beautifully dark grained african wood whose dense timber makes coveted crafting musical instruments bass solo newest scent vagabond prince truly virtuosic work wenge aroma combination beauty function inspired master perfumer bertrand duchaufour fashion fragrance extracts deep vibrant accords hidden within notes like profound resonance titular instrument bass solo offers aroma pitched lowest register dense melody composed selection exquisite woody notes including soft sandalwood salty driftwood blend cedars warm comfortable dry nuances smoky tar velvety peach flow striations light floral cardamom combines woodsy warmth softly caress wearer meanwhile higher pich lavender represents cold metal strings bringing spice wood together create magic sleek yet deep beautiful yet powerful bass solo represents bold new evolution vagabond prince striking scent we've encountered year,"saffron, ginger, lime, cardamom, lavender, cedar, cedar, fig milk, birch tar, sandalwood, amber, driftwood, wenge accord, musk, oppoponax, amyris, patchouli"

11 Eau de Parfum,Boris Bidjan Saberi,"Boris Bidjan Saberi has never been known for conservatism- his edgy, modern designs and provocative collections have raised eyebrows and thrilled fashion-lovers, all while maintaining an exceptional level of detail-oriented artisanal craftsmanship. So it's only fitting that for his debut fragrance 11, Saberi, in collaboration with Geza Schoen, has created a vibrant, stylish scent bursting with creativity. Inspired by Saberi's leatherwork studio, where he hand-constructs intricate horse leather jackets, this scent reflects the care, personality, and style that Boris imprints into every item he produces. While it might seem like this would result in a heavy, challengingly industrial fragrance, Geza Schoen has instead crafted a dynamically casual, everyday leather scent that we find surprisingly soft and fresh. An initial whiff of freshly cut grass slowly dissipates into something more craftsmanlike, a smooth, supple but substantial leather with hints of wax and glue to give it a playful and creative character. 11 wears with easygoing unisex modernity, masculine and refined on a man, chic and sexy on a woman.

Contre Bombarde 32 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF,"Contre Bombarde 32 is a paean to the centuries-old aromas of resins, wax, and old wood ingrained in the ancient organ at Notre Dame. The sharp, resinous topnotes of bitter orange peel, elemi, and juniper captures perfectly the smell of unburned resins and wet stone that lingers in gloomy European cathedrals.

Voix Humaine 8 Extrait de Parfum,Filippo Sorcinelli - SAUF,"Voix Humaine 8 is inspired by Vox Humana, a type of reed stop on the organ designed to impressionistically imitate the human voice. When pressed, this stop has the tone of a soprano hitting a high note, a sound that seems to linger in the air long after the other notes fade. Accordingly, Voix Humaine 8 takes dry, peppery incense and infuses it with a cool, white floral milk, giving it the sweet edge of a singed marshmallow. Musky ambrette seed and a mousseline accord lend the texture a cashmere softness that tempers the dark incense.

Bowmakers Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga,"If you can imagine a workshop, lit by oil lamps and a brace of flickering candles, wax dripping to the floor. Everywhere is wood, maple, mahogany, chips of darkest ebony, floor littered in fragrant curled shavings, the air filled with lacquered dust and the aromatics of a thousand sweet pencils. A man bends over an oak bench, tending to the curved form of a violin, the body warm and golden in the soft light, its neck, pegs and tailpiece scattered under his nimble fingers. Puffs of pine resin drift as he works, smoothing, gluing and attending to the preparation of varnishes and oils to give ornate lustre to grain and line. This is D.S & Durga's Bowmakers, an astonishing time capsule evocation of violin and bow making workshops in 18th century American pioneer towns. Each workshop concocted their own secret recipe for the decorative shellacs and lacquers. These might contain elemi, benzoin, saffron, mastic, sandalwood and turpentine for color, preservation, finish, tone and beauty.

Debaser Pocket Perfume Perfume Oil,D.S. and Durga,"Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent, Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail, the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser, named after the bands 1989 hit, is not a typically creamy, lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright, hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic, warm, bold and woody fig. It's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown, when it shed the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris, coconut, tonka and moss - leave cool, velvet-soft hint of wood on skin. Earthy and addictive.","bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,blaring pixies music hot day that's inspiration duga's woody fig scent debaser anyone heard pixies' front man black francis' wail thought fig scent may seem odd choice debaser named bands hit typically creamy lactic fruity fig bright hot green scent opens waft fig tree broiling august sun energetic warm bold woody fig fragrance becomes even compelling drydown shed specificity figgy verisimilitude that's perfect blend base notes iris coconut tonka moss leave cool velvet soft hint wood skin earthy addictive,"bergamot, green leaf, pear stem, fig, coconut milk, iris, blond woods, tonka bean, moss"

Au Coeur du Desert Parfum Extrait,Tauer Perfumes,"If Andy Tauer's masterpiece L'Air du Desert Marocain evokes the open spaces of a boundless desert sky racing above our heads, then Au Coeur du Desert, based on the original cult classic, is its heart - a quietly beating center of gravity bound to the earth. Although it shares with its progenitor the same dry crackle of cedar and resin, Au Coeur is an altogether more intimate affair, with a melting softness that envelops rather than exalts.
Au Coeur du Desert is a luxurious extrait that uses higher concentrations of the keynote ingredients that gave the original L'Air its soul: coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, ambergris, and resin. To our noses, Au Coeur has a smoother quality of patchouli, warmer woods, and a higher dose of ambergris, its salted golden warmth throwing all the other notes into stark relief. In terms of texture, Au Coeur is dense silk to L'Air's smoke. Those who love L'Air du Desert Marocain will be relieved to find clear echoes in Au Coeur, but those who found the original too dramatic will be delighted to find a version built on a more human scale. The DNA is intact, but its light is more the hazy glow of dusk rather than the glare of the midday sun, while still remaining unmistakably, wonderfully, quintessentially Andy Tauer.","coriander, cumin, petitgrain, rock rose, jasmine, patchouli, dry cedar woods, vetiver, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31434.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,andy tauer's masterpiece l'air du desert marocain evokes open spaces boundless desert sky racing heads au coeur du desert based original cult classic heart quietly beating center gravity bound earth although shares progenitor dry crackle cedar resin au coeur altogether intimate affair melting softness envelops rather exalts au coeur du desert luxurious extrait uses higher concentrations keynote ingredients gave original l'air soul coriander cumin patchouli cedar ambergris resin noses au coeur smoother quality patchouli warmer woods higher dose ambergris salted golden warmth throwing notes stark relief terms texture au coeur dense silk l'air's smoke love l'air du desert marocain relieved find clear echoes au coeur found original dramatic delighted find version built human scale dna intact light hazy glow dusk rather glare midday sun still remaining unmistakably wonderfully quintessentially andy tauer,"coriander, cumin, petitgrain, rock rose, jasmine, patchouli, dry cedar woods, vetiver, ambergris"
Sheiduna Parfum Extrait,Puredistance,"Shei-du-na. Enunciate each syllable and all the right associations come to mind: she, sheikh, dunes. In his 1992 novel The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje mentions that sand dunes in the Sahara resemble the dips and hollows of a woman's back. Sheiduna perfectly captures that sense of duality between two things that look the same and yet are not the same âÂ the shadowed softness of a woman's hip and the dusty angularity of a wind-sharpened dune. The opening is a plume of smoke and tangerine peel set inside a golden, radiant cloud of resins that swirls around the wearer like a sand storm. Out of this expansive blur of sparkling particles emerges a spicy clove note that gives the fragrance a subtle vintage Opium hue. A rich rose weaves in and out of this fuzzy haze of amber and spices, like the orange-red glow of lighthouse in thick fog. It's this seamless shifting between dry, spicy radiance and soft, sweet florals and vanilla that makes Sheiduna so interesting â and so difficult to define. We'd sum it up by saying it's like breathing in the arid air of the desert while nuzzling the neck of an exotically perfumed woman.","lemon, tangerine, blackcurrant, aldehydes, rose essence, geranium, clove, vetiver, patchouli, woody amber, incense, benzoin, myrrh, tonka bean, vanilla pods, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,shei du na enunciate syllable right associations come mind sheikh dunes novel english patient michael ondaatje mentions sand dunes sahara resemble dips hollows woman's back sheiduna perfectly captures sense duality two things look yet shadowed softness woman's hip dusty angularity wind sharpened dune opening plume smoke tangerine peel set inside golden radiant cloud resins swirls around wearer like sand storm expansive blur sparkling particles emerges spicy clove note gives fragrance subtle vintage opium hue rich rose weaves fuzzy haze amber spices like orange red glow lighthouse thick fog seamless shifting dry spicy radiance soft sweet florals vanilla makes sheiduna interesting difficult define we'd sum saying like breathing arid air desert nuzzling neck exotically perfumed woman,"lemon, tangerine, blackcurrant, aldehydes, rose essence, geranium, clove, vetiver, patchouli, woody amber, incense, benzoin, myrrh, tonka bean, vanilla pods, musk"

Grant sets out to capture it all in Covent Garden the fragrance, an exuberant and sparkling unisex citrus floral rich with the smells and energy of one of London's most vibrant locales.

Picadilly '69 Eau de Parfum,Jack Perfume,"On his first-ever trip to London in 1969, a 12-year old Richard E. Grant was mesmerized by the colorful characters of Picadilly Circus- not to mention the intoxicating scents of the busy social hub- the petrol, the leather, the Earl Grey tea, and of course, the patchouli oil worn so ubiquitously by mods, hippies and youth of all stripes. Picadilly '69 is a faithful ode to this scent memory, a visceral rush of spicy, earthy, stimulating and narcotic, a perfect representation of the extremely specific time and place, but also the universal experience of a teenager taking their first hesitant steps into the desires and appeals of the adult world. Picadilly '69 opens crisp and fresh, with bergamot (representing the Earl Grey at Fortnum and Mason) and ginger giving an invigorating initial rush against the green notes wafting over from nearby St. James' Park. The energetic cityscape is well-represented in the heart, with hypnotic notes of cypriol and petrol, while the rich leather drydown is sensuous and provocative. Whether you fondly remember the Summer of Love, or merely want a taste of a historic, yet personal, awakening, Picadilly '69 will take you to a time and place where anything was possible.","bergamot, ginger, green leaves, cypriol, mate, petrol, cedar, amber, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/75602.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first ever trip london year old richard e grant mesmerized colorful characters picadilly circus mention intoxicating scents busy social hub petrol leather earl grey tea course patchouli oil worn ubiquitously mods hippies youth stripes picadilly ' faithful ode scent memory visceral rush spicy earthy stimulating narcotic perfect representation extremely specific time place also universal experience teenager taking first hesitant steps desires appeals adult world picadilly ' opens crisp fresh bergamot representing earl grey fortnum mason ginger giving invigorating initial rush green notes wafting nearby st james' park energetic cityscape well represented heart hypnotic notes cypriol petrol rich leather drydown sensuous provocative whether fondly remember summer love merely want taste historic yet personal awakening picadilly ' take time place anything possible,"bergamot, ginger, green leaves, cypriol, mate, petrol, cedar, amber, leather"

Lilac Love Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Disclaimer: this is not a lilac perfume. This is a lilac-colored angora sweater that you want to wear on your naked skin while rolling around on 1,000-thread count sheets with a basket of gray Persian kittens. It is a million miles away from the bold oriental regalia of the Amouage lineage â this one whispers, and has an adorable French accent. We can't get over how pretty Lilac Love is. A soft bouquet of roses, jasmine, gardenia, and heliotrope is whipped up into a rosy, milky froth, dusted liberally with cocoa powder, tonka bean shavings, and fresh vanilla sugar.

Ambre Loup Eau de Parfum,Rania J.,"We know what you're thinking. Amber - been there, done that, got the t-shirt, yadda yadda. Well, we're here to tell you that Ambre Loup is different and that you need it. Because this wild thing with a tarry, smoky twist is the amber that touches the primal part of your hunter-gatherer soul that other ambers failed to reach. Ambre Loup opens up on a smoky, animalic castoreum note that comes off partly like oud oil and partly like warm, chewy tar. Peru balsam is responsible for a thick, cinnamon-spiced resinousness, but labdanum is real the star of the show here, displaying every nuance of its rich, smoky, tobacco-like character. Under the dry, rugged woods and resins, a slow-moving river of golden vanilla and tonka swells up and fills the scent with a sweet, creamy sensuousness. Quite simply, a amber that is too beautiful, unique, and unusual to pass up.","clove, spices, balsam, labdanum, vanilla, agarwood, gaiac, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,know thinking amber done got shirt yadda yadda well we're tell ambre loup different need wild thing tarry smoky twist amber touches primal part hunter gatherer soul ambers failed reach ambre loup opens smoky animalic castoreum note comes partly like oud oil partly like warm chewy tar peru balsam responsible thick cinnamon spiced resinousness labdanum real star show displaying every nuance rich smoky tobacco like character dry rugged woods resins slow moving river golden vanilla tonka swells fills scent sweet creamy sensuousness quite simply amber beautiful unique unusual pass,"clove, spices, balsam, labdanum, vanilla, agarwood, gaiac, cedar"
Jasmin Kama Eau de Parfum,Rania J.,"Jasmin Kama is an excellent showcase for Egyptian jasmine, which is richly animalic, slightly coarse, and fruity. The word Kama brings to mind thoughts of the Kama Sutra, and why yes, this is one seriously carnal scent!
A brilliant bergamot opens the show with a sour, bright citrus accent that fizzes violently enough to get your saliva glands working. A clutch of Egyptian jasmine blooms immediately begin to pump out a stream of inky, fecund indoles into the air, reminding the wearer that the aroma of jasmine is excitingly close to the smell of decay, sex, and rebirth. Heliotrope adds a powdery sparkle that balances out the inky, fruity jasmine, but earthy patchouli in the base drags jasmine further into the shadows. Simultaneously fresh and indolic, Jasmin Kama is a jasmine for those searching for a different take on this most sultry of white flowers.","bergamot, rosa damascena, jasmine (jasmin absolute), patchouli, sandalwood, heliotrope, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,jasmin kama excellent showcase egyptian jasmine richly animalic slightly coarse fruity word kama brings mind thoughts kama sutra yes one seriously carnal scent brilliant bergamot opens show sour bright citrus accent fizzes violently enough get saliva glands working clutch egyptian jasmine blooms immediately begin pump stream inky fecund indoles air reminding wearer aroma jasmine excitingly close smell decay sex rebirth heliotrope adds powdery sparkle balances inky fruity jasmine earthy patchouli base drags jasmine shadows simultaneously fresh indolic jasmin kama jasmine searching different take sultry white flowers,"bergamot, rosa damascena, jasmine (jasmin absolute), patchouli, sandalwood, heliotrope, vanilla, musk"
T. Habanero Eau de Parfum,Rania J.,"T. Habanero stuns with its unique portrayal of what happens when a fruity, stinky Cambodi oud meets a dark, nutty tobacco leaf. Imagine a thick stew of chocolatey spices fermenting in an oak barrel, and a man pouring in handfuls of dry tobacco leaves and oud wood chips, dark with resin. After a long soak, the drenched woods and tobacco leaves are spread out to bake under a hot sun, releasing a host of fruited, dark, fermented aromas. One doesn't know where the oud begins and the tobacco ends.
The genius of this scent is that the perfumer knows how to pull all the chaotic, disparate elements of the scent into one harmonious whole, using a smooth, earthy myrrh to link the fungal dampness of the oud to the creamy sweetness of the tobacco leaf. What could have easily been a rough cacophony turns out to be a suave and sophisticated tobacco fragrance. A real tour de force.","pink pepper, black pepper, cardamom, black tobacco, sandalwood, agarwood, incense, myrrh, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,habanero stuns unique portrayal happens fruity stinky cambodi oud meets dark nutty tobacco leaf imagine thick stew chocolatey spices fermenting oak barrel man pouring handfuls dry tobacco leaves oud wood chips dark resin long soak drenched woods tobacco leaves spread bake hot sun releasing host fruited dark fermented aromas one know oud begins tobacco ends genius scent perfumer knows pull chaotic disparate elements scent one harmonious whole using smooth earthy myrrh link fungal dampness oud creamy sweetness tobacco leaf could easily rough cacophony turns suave sophisticated tobacco fragrance real tour de force,"pink pepper, black pepper, cardamom, black tobacco, sandalwood, agarwood, incense, myrrh, leather"
Lavande 44 Eau de Parfum,Rania J.,"If you think you smelled every possible variation on the lavender theme, then think again. Rania J.'s Lavande 44 is a wholly unique take on the genre, mixing one part aromatics (green, fresh lavender bud) with one part animalics (oud, musk) and two parts resinous oriental (labdanum, tonka, patchouli). The result is stunning. A cube of sour citrus and aromatic lavender up top melts down through the fragrance structure, pooling in and around buttery tonka and providing little sparks of electric freshness to the dark, animalic oud. Vetiver root in the base joins with the lavender and patchouli to form a damp, salty breeze that makes one think of the humid air in a pine forest. A thoroughly modern way to wear lavender, Lavande 44 dispels all thoughts of shaving soap and sachets for the linen drawer.","bergamot, petitgrain, lavender (essential oil absolute), oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751003.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,think smelled every possible variation lavender theme think rania j 's lavande wholly unique take genre mixing one part aromatics green fresh lavender bud one part animalics oud musk two parts resinous oriental labdanum tonka patchouli result stunning cube sour citrus aromatic lavender top melts fragrance structure pooling around buttery tonka providing little sparks electric freshness dark animalic oud vetiver root base joins lavender patchouli form damp salty breeze makes one think humid air pine forest thoroughly modern way wear lavender lavande dispels thoughts shaving soap sachets linen drawer,"bergamot, petitgrain, lavender (essential oil absolute), oud"
Oud Assam Eau de Parfum,Rania J.,"Oud virgins, look away now â Rania J.'s majestic Oud Assam features an authentic Indian oud oil that doesn't pull any punches. The juicy, bitter orange framing the opening notes only serves to highlight the creamy bleu cheese feel of the oud. But give it a moment to settle, and you'll begin to understand why Indian oud is considered the most spiritually uplifting type of oud. As the nose adjusts and the oud note begins to soften, one begins to discern the complex aromas of deep golden spice, leather, and fermented, creamy woodiness. A smell as ancient as time itself.
Better yet, this is one Western oud that doesn't drift into aimless sweetness in the base. Instead, a nutty vetiver, peppery musk, and smoky incense contributes a fresh, woodsy character that makes one think of a great forest in a Northern clime. A genuine oud experience in this price bracket is a rarity â we recommend you take the leap.","bergamot, sweet orange, bitter orange, oud, cedar, vetiver, frankincense, black pepper, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/751004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oud virgins look away rania j 's majestic oud assam features authentic indian oud oil pull punches juicy bitter orange framing opening notes serves highlight creamy bleu cheese feel oud give moment settle begin understand indian oud considered spiritually uplifting type oud nose adjusts oud note begins soften one begins discern complex aromas deep golden spice leather fermented creamy woodiness smell ancient time better yet one western oud drift aimless sweetness base instead nutty vetiver peppery musk smoky incense contributes fresh woodsy character makes one think great forest northern clime genuine oud experience price bracket rarity recommend take leap,"bergamot, sweet orange, bitter orange, oud, cedar, vetiver, frankincense, black pepper, tonka bean, musk"

Rose Omeyyade Eau de Parfum,Atelier des Ors,"Bewitching, beautiful, and a touch too beguiling to be completely safe, Rose Omeyyade is the very definition of a secret weapon. Named for the Umayyad dynasty, whose kingdom once stretched from Westernmost Europe to the Middle East, Rose Omeyyade is as expansive and cultured as its namesake- a truly extraordinary floral. Rose Omeyyade opens with a burst of delectable florals, rich Damask Rose paired with fruity raspberry and energized with pink pepper. A heart of caramelized patchouli and rich gaiac furthers the east-meets-west motif with mouthwatering potency, which only deepens in the warm, soft and subtly animalic base of oud and amber.

Bapteme du Feu Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"A proper carnival is full of light, noise, laughter, activity- and, ideally, that exhilarating sense of chaos that makes the world feel topsy-turvy and just the right amount of dangerous. Inspired by the funfairs of Serge Lutens' youth, Bapteme du Feu is a stroll through a gleefully disorienting boardwalk featuring the wonderfully discordant notes of sweet delights, animalic musk and the acerbic gunpowder of the carnival shooting range. As in previous Lutens creations, his favorite childhood treat of gingerbread plays a central role, but unlike the soft creaminess of Five O'Clock au Gingembre, the sweet ginger here is offset with the bitterness of burnt orange peel and galvanized with the striking, metallic tang of gunpowder. We suppose you could call it an avant-garde gourmand, but that somehow doesn't seem to encompass it fully. Perhaps the best we can say is that it is, as all of Serge Lutens' best works are, a portal into the unique world and vision of one of perfumery's truly independent voices.","burnt orange peel, gunpowder, gingerbread, fresh ginger, cedar, incense, cinnamon, osmanthus, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36155.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,proper carnival full light noise laughter activity ideally exhilarating sense chaos makes world feel topsy turvy right amount dangerous inspired funfairs serge lutens' youth bapteme du feu stroll gleefully disorienting boardwalk featuring wonderfully discordant notes sweet delights animalic musk acerbic gunpowder carnival shooting range previous lutens creations favorite childhood treat gingerbread plays central role unlike soft creaminess five o'clock au gingembre sweet ginger offset bitterness burnt orange peel galvanized striking metallic tang gunpowder suppose could call avant garde gourmand somehow seem encompass fully perhaps best say serge lutens' best works portal unique world vision one perfumery's truly independent voices,"burnt orange peel, gunpowder, gingerbread, fresh ginger, cedar, incense, cinnamon, osmanthus, castoreum"
Green Pearl Eau de Parfum,Thameen,"In China, few objects are more revered, more coveted, more legandary than the Yemengzhu, luminescent minerals known to give unlimited luck and power to those few lucky enough to merely touch them. As lush and radiant as the otherworldly green glow of those treasured objects, Green Pearl is a wondrous addition to the Thameen line. Crisp, bracing notes of green apple and glowing citrus open into a bracingly green heart of artemisia and green tea that soothe even while radiating power. And just as Yemengzhu glow deep underground with no external light source, a base of rich tonka, oakmoss, and amber-tinged musk give off a humming glow that lasts for untold hours. The Yemengzhu are so unique among the many minerals of our planet that geologists still can't rule out mystical explanations as to their origin; with its undeniable and captivating quiet power, Green Pearl is a perfect representation in the world of fragrance.","green apple, mandarin, neroli, bergamot, green tea, artemisia, tonka, oakmoss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73409.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,china objects revered coveted legandary yemengzhu luminescent minerals known give unlimited luck power lucky enough merely touch lush radiant otherworldly green glow treasured objects green pearl wondrous addition thameen line crisp bracing notes green apple glowing citrus open bracingly green heart artemisia green tea soothe even radiating power yemengzhu glow deep underground external light source base rich tonka oakmoss amber tinged musk give humming glow lasts untold hours yemengzhu unique among many minerals planet geologists still can't rule mystical explanations origin undeniable captivating quiet power green pearl perfect representation world fragrance,"green apple, mandarin, neroli, bergamot, green tea, artemisia, tonka, oakmoss, musk"
Amber Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums,"A Rolls Royce in a sea of Volkswagens, Roja Dove's Amber Aoud sets out to best every other rose-oud out there by sheer dint of superior raw materials and blending. Expensive this may be, but Roja Dove puts his money where his mouth is. Taking a regally sour, spicy Indian oud, he buries it deep within the folds of a jammy rose, and then tucks the whole thing into the pulpy insides of a Moroccan fig. Almost obscenely rich and opulent at first, it wears like the inside of a red velvet cloak lined in ermine. But look closely and you will see the artful balance between sweet and sour, dusty and moist, sharp and smooth. There is structure and discipline within the avalanche of richness. Birch tar and incense resins and gums provide a smoky fade-out that proves to be excellent ballast for the jammy sweetness up top. No wonder that many oud aficionados cite this as the best example of Western oud perfumery- a point we'd find hard to dispute.","bergamot, lemon, lime, fig, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, ambergris, aoud wood, birch, cinnamon, civet, musk, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74812.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,rolls royce sea volkswagens roja dove's amber aoud sets best every rose oud sheer dint superior raw materials blending expensive may roja dove puts money mouth taking regally sour spicy indian oud buries deep within folds jammy rose tucks whole thing pulpy insides moroccan fig almost obscenely rich opulent first wears like inside red velvet cloak lined ermine look closely see artful balance sweet sour dusty moist sharp smooth structure discipline within avalanche richness birch tar incense resins gums provide smoky fade proves excellent ballast jammy sweetness top wonder many oud aficionados cite best example western oud perfumery point we'd find hard dispute,"bergamot, lemon, lime, fig, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, ambergris, aoud wood, birch, cinnamon, civet, musk, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, saffron, sandalwood"
Musk Aoud Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums,"Imagine a courtly banquet hall, its walls hung with massive velvet tapestries, Irish wolfhounds lounging in fireplaces, heavy winter fur cloaks and sleeping animals strewn all around the stone floor. The High Priest lights his censer in a lull of conversation, and walks slowly through the hall, allowing thick plumes of smoke from fragrant incense resins and bitter dried herbs to circulate. Traders have brought a rare treasure for the King to look at â tiny shards of what they call oud wood. He burns a piece, and the air is suddenly pierced with a majestic aroma that comprises sour woodiness, smoke, rot, and a forest floor. This is what Musk Aoud smells like. All of this, all at once.
Roja Dove's Musk Aoud is deeply, carnally suggestive. The musk is warm and suggestive of both animal and human fur. But what really rocks our boat is the current of smoky, oily sweetness running though the fragrance. The tensile weight here suggests centuries of smells packed in one on top of another, finally merging into one suggestive whole. We find it incredibly sexy. In fact, if we arrive at a bacchanalia and this scent isn't being pumped through the air ducts, then we're leaving.","bergamot, lemon, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, ambrette, birch, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, precious woods, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74813.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,imagine courtly banquet hall walls hung massive velvet tapestries irish wolfhounds lounging fireplaces heavy winter fur cloaks sleeping animals strewn around stone floor high priest lights censer lull conversation walks slowly hall allowing thick plumes smoke fragrant incense resins bitter dried herbs circulate traders brought rare treasure king look tiny shards call oud wood burns piece air suddenly pierced majestic aroma comprises sour woodiness smoke rot forest floor musk aoud smells like roja dove's musk aoud deeply carnally suggestive musk warm suggestive animal human fur really rocks boat current smoky oily sweetness running though fragrance tensile weight suggests centuries smells packed one top another finally merging one suggestive whole find incredibly sexy fact arrive bacchanalia scent pumped air ducts we're leaving,"bergamot, lemon, jasmine, rose, ylang-ylang, agarwood, ambrette, birch, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, precious woods, sandalwood, tonka bean, vanilla"
Diaghilev Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums,"Mitsouko reupholstered in more expensive fabrics? Since it is named for Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes and someone who drenched the curtains in his bedroom and theatres with Mitsouko, it's tempting to think so. Insanely rich and opulent, Diaghilev takes the three pillars of the chypre â oakmoss, bergamot, and labdanum resin â and wraps them up in a length of the dusty red velvet curtain that's been hanging in the Opera National de Paris for over a century.
But that's only part of the story. After all, who would pay such a high price for a remake of Mitsouko? Diaghilev stands head and shoulders above all other chypres for two reasons. First, the quality of the raw materials â think the smoothest oakmoss, the inkiest vetiver, the most exquisite ambrette seed, and finest floral absolutes â makes for an experience so intoxicating that you just stop questioning the cost. Second, Roja Dove has flushed the perfume with sensual musks, civet, resins, overripe fruit, and castoreum, loosening the stays on that uptight chypre structure and making it impossible to wear without thinking about sex. Bitter, rich, and complex, Diaghilev is the scent of old books, musty theatres, velvet curtains soaked in Mitsouko, and the sheen of salty, lickable, post-coital sweat on your lover's skin. Put smelling Diaghilev on your bucket list.","bergamot, lemon, lime, orange, tarragon, blackcurrant buds, heliotrope, jasmine, peach, rose, tuberose, violet, ylang-ylang, ambrette, benzoin, cedarwood, civet, clove, cumin, guaiacwood, labdanum, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, patchouli, balsam, sandalwood, styrax, vanilla, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74815.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mitsouko reupholstered expensive fabrics since named sergei diaghilev founder ballets russes someone drenched curtains bedroom theatres mitsouko tempting think insanely rich opulent diaghilev takes three pillars chypre oakmoss bergamot labdanum resin wraps length dusty red velvet curtain that's hanging opera national de paris century that's part story would pay high price remake mitsouko diaghilev stands head shoulders chypres two reasons first quality raw materials think smoothest oakmoss inkiest vetiver exquisite ambrette seed finest floral absolutes makes experience intoxicating stop questioning cost second roja dove flushed perfume sensual musks civet resins overripe fruit castoreum loosening stays uptight chypre structure making impossible wear without thinking sex bitter rich complex diaghilev scent old books musty theatres velvet curtains soaked mitsouko sheen salty lickable post coital sweat lover's skin put smelling diaghilev bucket list,"bergamot, lemon, lime, orange, tarragon, blackcurrant buds, heliotrope, jasmine, peach, rose, tuberose, violet, ylang-ylang, ambrette, benzoin, cedarwood, civet, clove, cumin, guaiacwood, labdanum, leather, musk, nutmeg, oakmoss, patchouli, balsam, sandalwood, styrax, vanilla, vetiver"
Nuwa Extrait de Parfum,Roja Parfums,"Named for an ancient Chinese goddess known for creating mankind and repairing the pillars of heaven, and described by Roja Dove as 'The Elixir of the Gods', it would seem that Nuwa has a lot to live up to. Famously reformulated in 2015 to banish a heavy, animalistic cumin note, Nuwa is now reborn as a floral oriental with a delicate transparency that jives better with its Chinese inspiration. It is simply exquisite. Now a gently-spiced floral with a peachy osmanthus heart and a backdrop of smoky black tea, Nuwa is a fragrance to wear while strolling down the Riverside Promenade in Shanghai, slowly twirling a stiff silk umbrella over your head. Smoky resins and spice add exoticism, but never obscure the golden florals. Later on, a dusky jasmine accord moves in, and the effect is like walking under a pagoda dripping with jasmine vines at night, their warm, spicy scent snaking out into the warm air around you. If rose gold had a scent, it would be this.","bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant buds, immortelle, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang-ylang ambergris, birch, black pepper, cistus, clove, cumin, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, storax, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/74816.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,named ancient chinese goddess known creating mankind repairing pillars heaven described roja dove 'the elixir gods' would seem nuwa lot live famously reformulated banish heavy animalistic cumin note nuwa reborn floral oriental delicate transparency jives better chinese inspiration simply exquisite gently spiced floral peachy osmanthus heart backdrop smoky black tea nuwa fragrance wear strolling riverside promenade shanghai slowly twirling stiff silk umbrella head smoky resins spice add exoticism never obscure golden florals later dusky jasmine accord moves effect like walking pagoda dripping jasmine vines night warm spicy scent snaking warm air around rose gold scent would,"bergamot, lemon, blackcurrant buds, immortelle, jasmine, osmanthus, rose, ylang-ylang ambergris, birch, black pepper, cistus, clove, cumin, oakmoss, orris, patchouli, storax, vetiver"

Mojave Ghost Roll-on Oil Perfume Oil,BYREDO,"In the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. The ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground.

Amber Room Eau de Parfum,Thameen,"This molten scent of golden glow is inspired by the story of the Amber Room; a near mythical chamber originally constructed in Catherine the Great's Winter Palace near St Petersburg. Made from six tons of amber and decorated with pearls and precious stones, the mirrored, gilded and ambered walls reflected candlelight like fire. Rumours of its potential location come and go, but the Amber Room seems to have slipped away forever, leaving behind memories of jewelled excess and empirical vainglory.

Indian Wood Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","With the original PG 11, Harmatan Noir, Pierre Guillaume explored the concept of a robust desert wind, carrying a powerful contrast of sweet lemon mint and Jamaican allspice on its warm, dry breezes. With 11.1, Indian Wood, Guillaume returns to the idea of the contrast between aromatics and spices, but this time the mint in question is piquant peppermint set against a rich, quintessentially Indian blend of nutmeg and cardamom, delivering a nose-tingling bouquet of energetic depth. A blend of moss and balsamic woods further adds to the robust character, while the innate dryness of the central accord is offset with a judicious touch of coconut milk. The overall effect seems to stand at the exact nexus of sweet and spicy, of warm and delicate, a balance so perfect that it seems simply effortless until one considers the contrary forces at work. Intoxicating, invigorating and playful, Indian Wood is another testament to the wondrous originality of Pierre Guillaume.","sandalwood, vetiver, moss, spicy mint, nutmeg, cardamom, coconut milk, lemon zest",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34550.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,original pg harmatan noir pierre guillaume explored concept robust desert wind carrying powerful contrast sweet lemon mint jamaican allspice warm dry breezes indian wood guillaume returns idea contrast aromatics spices time mint question piquant peppermint set rich quintessentially indian blend nutmeg cardamom delivering nose tingling bouquet energetic depth blend moss balsamic woods adds robust character innate dryness central accord offset judicious touch coconut milk overall effect seems stand exact nexus sweet spicy warm delicate balance perfect seems simply effortless one considers contrary forces work intoxicating invigorating playful indian wood another testament wondrous originality pierre guillaume,"sandalwood, vetiver, moss, spicy mint, nutmeg, cardamom, coconut milk, lemon zest"

Once the salty, ocean-tinged woods of the base set in, we're downright transported- not to a bougie beach club, mind you, but perhaps the latter hours of an all-night full moon party in Koh Phangan, as the sun is just starting to peek over the horizon and the last people standing can take a deep exhale and marvel at the craziness fading into memory.

Marfa Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"A arid tuberose as singularly inspired as the West Texas oasis whose name it bears. Marfa, the new scent from MEMO, captures the elusive totality of this small, isolated city- modern art mecca, historic frontiertown, legendary nexus of paranormal and extraterrestrial activity- melding the glowing warmth of desert twilight with surprisingly sweet florals and modern musks to paint a portrait of a locale that straddles regions, cultures and time itself.
Marfa opens with an immediate punch of orange blossom and tuberose, fruity and sweet but also surprisingly dry, imbued with surreal weightlessness. A highway of dry, gently smooth woods stretches ahead of us, and the haunting lights of the creamy, musky base glow with quiet intensity. The notes don't seem to make sense together, and yet the collective impression is undeniably cohesive, a place that shouldn't exist and yet thrives, replacing the logic of the rest of the world with something distinctive, alien, and unexpectedly beautiful. Equal parts austere and unabashed, bold and understated, challenging and downright lovely, Marfa isn't meant to be understood- at least, not until you find yourself deep in its heart, and realizing that you never want to leave.","mandarin, orange blossom, agave, tuberose, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,arid tuberose singularly inspired west texas oasis whose name bears marfa new scent memo captures elusive totality small isolated city modern art mecca historic frontiertown legendary nexus paranormal extraterrestrial activity melding glowing warmth desert twilight surprisingly sweet florals modern musks paint portrait locale straddles regions cultures time marfa opens immediate punch orange blossom tuberose fruity sweet also surprisingly dry imbued surreal weightlessness highway dry gently smooth woods stretches ahead us haunting lights creamy musky base glow quiet intensity notes seem make sense together yet collective impression undeniably cohesive place exist yet thrives replacing logic rest world something distinctive alien unexpectedly beautiful equal parts austere unabashed bold understated challenging downright lovely marfa meant understood least find deep heart realizing never want leave,"mandarin, orange blossom, agave, tuberose, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, cedar, vanilla, white musk"

Carved Oud Extrait de Parfum,Thameen,"This compelling blend of divine woods, patchouli and an elegantly parched oud is a scent of adornment and ritual, inspired by the Solah Shringar or sixteen adornments, a handed down ceremonial set of symbolic customs applied to Hindu brides during the wedding preparations. These detailed ordinances govern jewellery and decoration for the hair, face hands, feet and eyes. The original belief was the beautification of the sixteen body parts would protect the bride against any negative effects of the moon cycle. The rootiness of a malachite vetiver note supports the ligneous oud and an unusually nutty patchouli. A gasp of antiseptic cypriol and cypress is key as woods and powerful musks drop into skin.

Peacock Throne Eau de Parfum,Thameen,"Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan (of Taj Mahal fame..) gave orders for the construction of an opulent throne on a golden dais for the legendary Red Fort in Delhi. It took seven years to complete and was exuberantly decorated in rubies, emeralds, gold and peacock motifs. Sadly this luminous throne was looted as war booty in 1739 by the Persians and disappeared into history. The Egyptian jasmine and orris in Peacock Throne have a captivating pearlescent texture straight out of the Thameen midnight blue bottle, the extrait strength formula literally glistening on skin. Pink pepper adds a snappy aromatic crunch and a dash of rather sweet lemon stops the jasmine tumbling into indolic indulgence. The brioche and jam sensation of the trademark Taif rose has a touch of nutmeg over the top, imparting a deeply comforting aroma over a rubicund patchouli and moreish vanilla base. Everything glows like a private sunset.","lemon, pink pepper, nutmeg, taif rose, ylang-ylang, rose, jasmine, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73402.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mughal emperor shah jahan taj mahal fame gave orders construction opulent throne golden dais legendary red fort delhi took seven years complete exuberantly decorated rubies emeralds gold peacock motifs sadly luminous throne looted war booty persians disappeared history egyptian jasmine orris peacock throne captivating pearlescent texture straight thameen midnight blue bottle extrait strength formula literally glistening skin pink pepper adds snappy aromatic crunch dash rather sweet lemon stops jasmine tumbling indolic indulgence brioche jam sensation trademark taif rose touch nutmeg top imparting deeply comforting aroma rubicund patchouli moreish vanilla base everything glows like private sunset,"lemon, pink pepper, nutmeg, taif rose, ylang-ylang, rose, jasmine, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla"
Noorolain Taif Eau de Parfum,Thameen,"Noorolain Taif is a peppery rose composition, a collision of Taif and Turkish roses lavishly dusted with pink and black peppers and a crackle of toasted coriander seed. A glimpse of jasmine glows amid the rose, just enough to add a sense of dirty sunshine. This vivacious opening is fabulous and a perfect homage to the Noor-ul-Ain or Light of the Eye that inspired it, one of the world's largest pink diamonds, mounted into a sublime tiara of the same name made by American jeweller Harry Winston. The oval brilliantine gemstone is a very singular shade of pink and this somehow feels brilliantly reflected in the glittering cannonade of rosaceous pepper at the top. Noorolain Taif is a gutsy, if not savoury experience, smoothing out as it settles into the base notes of agarwood, amber and potent cashmeran. It is a moody and regal fragrance, befitting its in namesake, but it has beautiful rose charisma and graceful longevity of hour upon spiced hour on the skin.","orange, coriander, pink pepper, taif rose, rose absolute, jasmine, vetiver, cashmere wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/73405.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,noorolain taif peppery rose composition collision taif turkish roses lavishly dusted pink black peppers crackle toasted coriander seed glimpse jasmine glows amid rose enough add sense dirty sunshine vivacious opening fabulous perfect homage noor ul light eye inspired one world's largest pink diamonds mounted sublime tiara name made american jeweller harry winston oval brilliantine gemstone singular shade pink somehow feels brilliantly reflected glittering cannonade rosaceous pepper top noorolain taif gutsy savoury experience smoothing settles base notes agarwood amber potent cashmeran moody regal fragrance befitting namesake beautiful rose charisma graceful longevity hour upon spiced hour skin,"orange, coriander, pink pepper, taif rose, rose absolute, jasmine, vetiver, cashmere wood, musk"

To represent this in a fragrance, Etat Libre d'Orange has delivered an aromatic, woody enigma of a scent both hauntingly cold and surprisingly bright. Hermann opens with chilly top notes of blackcurrant buds, and galbanum, spice without heat, maintaining an alluringly spooky disposition. In the heart, rich frankincense and peppery rose absolute add depth and character while staying shockingly weightless, allowing the aromatic notes to still filter through with impressive longevity. A base of patchouli is similarly elevated with a heavy dose of musky ambroxan, reminding us of the impossibility of holding even the largest shadow in one's hands.

Night Flower Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums,"It's 3am and she's in four-inch stilettos, sauntering home in perfect deshabille chic wearing a silk charmeuse gown, draped in vintage fur, and smoking a cigarette without a care in the world who sees... and Night Flower would be the perfume she'd wear. She's not meek or overly polite, and she likes her perfume like she lives her life: headstrong, decadent, and never prim and proper. A creamy tuberose is her fragrant weapon of choice, a sultry white blossom scent that's been a narcotic muse in perfumery for time immemorial. In Night Flower, it's sweet and buttery, contemporary and decidedly non-cloying, its larger-than-life-ness tethered by the gourmand scents of peppery-citrus bergamot, spicy-sweet cardamom, dry cinnamon, and a vanilla-esque tonka bean. A smoldering, almost leathery birch tar enhanced with soft suede is woven throughout, giving fair warning that this femme fatale of a perfume is anything but predictable or tame.","bergamot, birch tar, cardamom, suede accord, tuberose, cinnamon, patchouli, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/72901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,four inch stilettos sauntering home perfect deshabille chic wearing silk charmeuse gown draped vintage fur smoking cigarette without care world sees night flower would perfume she'd wear meek overly polite likes perfume like lives life headstrong decadent never prim proper creamy tuberose fragrant weapon choice sultry white blossom scent that's narcotic muse perfumery time immemorial night flower sweet buttery contemporary decidedly non cloying larger life ness tethered gourmand scents peppery citrus bergamot spicy sweet cardamom dry cinnamon vanilla esque tonka bean smoldering almost leathery birch tar enhanced soft suede woven throughout giving fair warning femme fatale perfume anything predictable tame,"bergamot, birch tar, cardamom, suede accord, tuberose, cinnamon, patchouli, tonka bean, musk"
Ma Bete Eau de Parfum,ERIS Parfums,"The soul of Ma Bete is anything but conventional...but its heart beats with classic beauty and contemporary passion. The honeyed, almost citrus-like neroli and heady warmth of jasmin sambac are the beauties in charge here, leading the grounded notes at its base astray, bringing them to their knees not through raw power but with finesse.

Shazam! Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"Oriental fragrances, by their nature, tend to aim for excess: more spices, more notes, more complexity, all in the pursuit of creating the rich, exotic depth inherent to the genre. But 4160 Tuesdays has never been the type of line to indulge in over-seriousness and groupthink, so Shazam! isn't your typical oriental- a tighter, more direct blend of indulgent amber, fresh spice, and surprising citrus and aromatics, Shazam! is both comfortingly rich and refreshingly direct- a true oriental for an oft-overwrought genre. Opening with juicy fresh tangerine and strikingly aromatic basil and juniper, Shazam! quickly warms up with a heart of rich woods, savory cardamom and smooth frankincense livened up with zesty pepper.

The aoud here is front and center, anchoring a powerful opening of sharp agarwood, savory cardamom and redolent saffron that quickly disavow any notions that this will be an overly dessert-y pushover.

It transforms Rosa Nigra's middle stage with refreshingly crisp herbal greenness, spicy geranium-like leafiness, and masculine woods whose quiet smokiness is counterbalanced by floral iris and clean musk.

Tabac Tabou Extrait de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Long before it was commodified and commercialized by Europeans, tobacco had a long history in the indigenous Americas as a sacred plant, smoked or burned for shamanic healing, purification and dream-vision rituals. This is the inspiration for Tabac Tabou, a tobacco perfume unlike any other, which strips away the preconceptions of cigarettes and cigars and Western indulgences and returns this holy crop to the natural domain from which it originally draws its great, mystical power. In Tabac Tabou, the tobacco leaf arrives folded in whiffs of fresh hay and wild landscape, rich and utterly untamed. A green, fresh narcissus meets white flowers, rough-hewn leather and compellingly fur-like animalic notes. Sweet, honeyed immortelle supports the main ingredient's natural sweetness, while unannounced secret ingredients lend incredible depths of earthy yet delicate nuance, confirming our feeling that this isn't so much a standard fragrance as it is a direct pipeline to a mystical world that used to be. Featuring a high quantity of extremely rare and precious materials, Tabac Tabou is now part of Parfum d'Empire's permanent collection, but the fragrance will be produced each year in restricted quantities, with the label indicating the vintage.","immortelle, tobacco, narcissus, honey, grass, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35717.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,long commodified commercialized europeans tobacco long history indigenous americas sacred plant smoked burned shamanic healing purification dream vision rituals inspiration tabac tabou tobacco perfume unlike strips away preconceptions cigarettes cigars western indulgences returns holy crop natural domain originally draws great mystical power tabac tabou tobacco leaf arrives folded whiffs fresh hay wild landscape rich utterly untamed green fresh narcissus meets white flowers rough hewn leather compellingly fur like animalic notes sweet honeyed immortelle supports main ingredient's natural sweetness unannounced secret ingredients lend incredible depths earthy yet delicate nuance confirming feeling much standard fragrance direct pipeline mystical world used featuring high quantity extremely rare precious materials tabac tabou part parfum d'empire's permanent collection fragrance produced year restricted quantities label indicating vintage,"immortelle, tobacco, narcissus, honey, grass, musk"

African Leather opens with a burst of gorgeously vivid exoticism, as stunningly bright bergamot illuminates a wondrous and wild blend of green, herbal spices, cardamom, cumin and saffron combining for a hugely evocative, ruggedly sensual set of top notes. In the grassy, floral heart, wild vetiver combines with a stunning geranium absolute that delivers commanding depth and a feral edge that rolls perfectly into the titular leather, a majestically unpolished, animalic leather that evokes tooth and fur, hide and claw, feeling as savagely regal as the great beasts of the savannah.

Chrysolithe Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"Mentioned in the Bible, Qu'ran and holy texts across Asia, chrysolithe (now often called peridot) is a gem-quality stone with a gold-green glow brilliant enough to more than explain why it inspired so much superstitious wonder across the ancient world. In his latest 'poem of stones,' Olivier Durbano celebrates the majestic power of this magical and precious material with a spectacular scent, equal parts fresh, spicy, green and warm, that shifts from woods to aromatics to spice with captivating, sparkling unpredictability. While Chrisolythe seems to have little use for the typical top-heart-base structure, the first blast seems to give you a taste of everything, with fresh, tart verbena glowing against a melange of dazzling spices and fiery ginger. As the uniquely green hyssop note emerges, its raw, camphorous qualities supplement various notes at random- for a moment pairing with rich cedar and sweet musk, then changing to favor aromatic sage and rosemary or delicately floral jasmine. As might befit a stone imbued with ancient and mystical power, we can't fully define what makes Chrysolithe so compelling. But there's no denying that its dynamic, aromatic, mysterious aura has absolutely cast a spell on us.","caraway, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger, sage, rosemary, jasmine, cedar, vetiver, ambergris, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36915.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,mentioned bible qu'ran holy texts across asia chrysolithe often called peridot gem quality stone gold green glow brilliant enough explain inspired much superstitious wonder across ancient world latest 'poem stones ' olivier durbano celebrates majestic power magical precious material spectacular scent equal parts fresh spicy green warm shifts woods aromatics spice captivating sparkling unpredictability chrisolythe seems little use typical top heart base structure first blast seems give taste everything fresh tart verbena glowing melange dazzling spices fiery ginger uniquely green hyssop note emerges raw camphorous qualities supplement various notes random moment pairing rich cedar sweet musk changing favor aromatic sage rosemary delicately floral jasmine might befit stone imbued ancient mystical power can't fully define makes chrysolithe compelling there's denying dynamic aromatic mysterious aura absolutely cast spell us,"caraway, cinnamon, black pepper, ginger, sage, rosemary, jasmine, cedar, vetiver, ambergris, musk"
Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"Everyone loves the smell of vanilla, and yet somehow the perfect, universally wearable vanilla seems elusively rare- mouthwatering bakery gourmands scare away lovers of wispier, more floral concoctions, and both varieties are often seen as too feminine for men to wear. This is why we're so enthused with Dominique Ropion's brilliant creation for A Lab On Fire-- a just-right vanilla musk that we think smells divine on just about anyone. This enchanting elixir is sweet without seeming gooey, compelling without shouting in your face, and romantic with enough restraint to wear well on men and women alike. A soft rose lends its velvety tones throughout, darting in and out among the star players of clean musk, rich tonka bean absolute, vanilla, and amber. The ever-so-slightly powdery almond notes of heliotrope are the perfect complement, softening and rounding out the sweet toffee and barely-there blonde woods. Messy Sexy Just Rolled Out of Bed is a season-spanning wonder, displaying a warming sweet coziness on cool fall days, while bergamot and peach blossom bring a fresh, light addition to summer sunshine.

Oud Palao Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"As complex and gorgeous as the Zellige mosaic tiles from which it takes its inspiration, Diptyque's first foray into oud fragrance is an enchanting, exotic work of art all its own. Built around the titular Palao, a robust and renowned oud extract found only in Northern Laos, Oud Palao showcases all aspects of this wondrous ingredient- dark woods, sensual animalics, and creamy depths, all balanced against rich Bulgarian rose, and a deep, spiritual incense blend. In the smooth, rich drydown, sandalwood and vanilla add depth and longevity, while the lusciously elegant oud lingers, delivering a perfectly measured drop of smokiness alongside lightly earthy patchouli and resinous labdanum. The resultant balance is so smooth, so sumptuous, and so easy to love that we can picture it holding center stage at the most lavish of galas, or just as easily, keeping you company by a roaring fire on a moonlit night.

Noir Exquis Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"The Parisian patisserie is so much more than a simple shop- it's a place of wonder, where exquisite pastry and invigorating coffee aromas set the backdrop for timeless friendships, fierce intellectual debates, lazy afternoons, and chance romantic encounters. It was the last of these things, the idea of love blossoming over eclairs and cafe au lait, that inspired Bertrand Duchaufour to create Noir Exquis, a wondrous new gourmand that combines the mouthwatering scents of a patisserie with a deep, sophisticated, and luminous base of woods and floral amber that sings of attraction, connection and delight. Noir Exquis opens with a succulent combination of sweet orange and deep, rich chestnut, which soon opens up to a heart of syrupy maple and a true, full-bodied coffee that balances as perfectly against the sweets as the real thing. As it dries down, a delightful, lightly almond-inflected heliotrope blends perfectly with a creamy vanilla, while a notably darker wood note, described here as ebony, lends a dynamic and romantic touch to smoother, lightly powdery notes of tonka and sandalwood. What Duchaufour has created here is not a mere representation of a patisserie, but rather a capsule of every positive feeling one could associate with such a place. The results are truly lovely, and we're happy to say that Noir Exquis is a creamy, sweet, beautiful new achievement for one of our favorite perfumers.","chestnut, orange, orange blossom, coffee, maple syrup, ebony, heliotrope, vanilla, tonka, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/152010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,parisian patisserie much simple shop place wonder exquisite pastry invigorating coffee aromas set backdrop timeless friendships fierce intellectual debates lazy afternoons chance romantic encounters last things idea love blossoming eclairs cafe au lait inspired bertrand duchaufour create noir exquis wondrous new gourmand combines mouthwatering scents patisserie deep sophisticated luminous base woods floral amber sings attraction connection delight noir exquis opens succulent combination sweet orange deep rich chestnut soon opens heart syrupy maple true full bodied coffee balances perfectly sweets real thing dries delightful lightly almond inflected heliotrope blends perfectly creamy vanilla notably darker wood note described ebony lends dynamic romantic touch smoother lightly powdery notes tonka sandalwood duchaufour created mere representation patisserie rather capsule every positive feeling one could associate place results truly lovely we're happy say noir exquis creamy sweet beautiful new achievement one favorite perfumers,"chestnut, orange, orange blossom, coffee, maple syrup, ebony, heliotrope, vanilla, tonka, sandalwood"
PHI Une Rose de Kandahar Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"Phi is a luxurious scent, inspired by a natural extract of roses produced in Afghanistan's rose region, Nangarhar. This rose oil is extremely rare and of highest quality. Inspired by these roses, growing in a dry and rough land, Phi is a rare gem, complementing contrasting lines, rich in natural raw materials that add depth and authenticity. Due to the limited amount of the rose oil, Une Rose de Kandahar is not guaranteed to be available all the time.
The scent starts with a rich fruity line of apricot. An all natural apricot extract with its surprising richness enchants and blends into a stretch of cinnamon and hints of bitter almond, softened by bergamot essential oil. These spices lead over to voluptuous roses in the fragrance heart: Extremely rare rose essential oil with its unique scent of spices, plums and flower petals blends into rose absolute from Bulgaria and hints of Bourbon geranium. The rose petals melt on the skin into a dark tobacco fond, built around an amazing absolute of dried tobacco leaves. The animalic, leathery and woody tobacco opens the ground for a generously dosed layer of patchouli in the base of Phi. Here, woody and gourmand notes melt into hints of animalic lines. Vetiver, vanilla and tonka add richness and brilliance. A generous dose of exclusive musk and ambergris round the body of the fragrance and encircle the roses.","apricot, cinnamon, almond, bergamot, rose absolute, rose, bourbon geranium, tobacco leaf, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, musk ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31431.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,phi luxurious scent inspired natural extract roses produced afghanistan's rose region nangarhar rose oil extremely rare highest quality inspired roses growing dry rough land phi rare gem complementing contrasting lines rich natural raw materials add depth authenticity due limited amount rose oil une rose de kandahar guaranteed available time scent starts rich fruity line apricot natural apricot extract surprising richness enchants blends stretch cinnamon hints bitter almond softened bergamot essential oil spices lead voluptuous roses fragrance heart extremely rare rose essential oil unique scent spices plums flower petals blends rose absolute bulgaria hints bourbon geranium rose petals melt skin dark tobacco fond built around amazing absolute dried tobacco leaves animalic leathery woody tobacco opens ground generously dosed layer patchouli base phi woody gourmand notes melt hints animalic lines vetiver vanilla tonka add richness brilliance generous dose exclusive musk ambergris round body fragrance encircle roses,"apricot, cinnamon, almond, bergamot, rose absolute, rose, bourbon geranium, tobacco leaf, patchouli, vetiver, vanilla, tonka bean, musk ambergris"
Sotto La Luna Tuberose Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"The genius of Andy Tauer has always been his ability to see past- or perhaps to not see at all- the conventional, in service of his own unique perception of the scents and notes he loves. So while for most, a ""natural smelling"" tuberose would default into cool, creamy rich white floral territory, Andy's Sotto La Luna Tuberose turns in the other direction, envisioning a beguilingly green, peppery floral that brings the ""queen of the night"" into bright, warm daylight. Long time Tauer lovers will have particular reason to rejoice, as from the very first clove-spiced, galbanum-rich spray, it's clear that Sotto La Luna Tuberose is a throwback to Tauer's most iconic and distinct fragrances. Weaving through the rich spicy warmth of this full dose of ""Tauerade"", the heavy dose of natural tuberose absolute asserts herself-- creamy and floral as you'd expect, but so expertly blended against sweet ylang and stemmy jasmine as to bathe the notes in vibrant warmth and fresh green tones that feel spicy, natural and utterly unique. As the soft woods, patchouli and briskly musky ambergris base emerges, the tuberose is both softened and elevated, wonderfully recognizable while still leagues apart from any tuberose we've smelled before. Is Sotto La Luna Tuberose a typically unadorned soliflore? Perhaps not traditionally. But in a very real sense, that's exactly what it is: A singular, artistic vision of tuberose, as only Andy Tauer could bring us.","cinnamon, cloves, galbanum, geranium, tuberose, ylang-ylang, rose, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31432.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,genius andy tauer always ability see past perhaps see conventional service unique perception scents notes loves natural smelling tuberose would default cool creamy rich white floral territory andy's sotto la luna tuberose turns direction envisioning beguilingly green peppery floral brings queen night bright warm daylight long time tauer lovers particular reason rejoice first clove spiced galbanum rich spray clear sotto la luna tuberose throwback tauer's iconic distinct fragrances weaving rich spicy warmth full dose tauerade heavy dose natural tuberose absolute asserts creamy floral expect expertly blended sweet ylang stemmy jasmine bathe notes vibrant warmth fresh green tones feel spicy natural utterly unique soft woods patchouli briskly musky ambergris base emerges tuberose softened elevated wonderfully recognizable still leagues apart tuberose we've smelled sotto la luna tuberose typically unadorned soliflore perhaps traditionally real sense that's exactly singular artistic vision tuberose andy tauer could bring us,"cinnamon, cloves, galbanum, geranium, tuberose, ylang-ylang, rose, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, ambergris"
Jasmin Angelique Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne,"When most fragrance houses announce a jasmine scent, it doesn't necessarily move the needle, but as a house dedicated solely to cologne-style compositions, the notably indolic, sensual white flower might seem a bit more challenging. Luckily for us, Jerome Epinette and Atelier Cologne have done it again- Jasmin Angelique is a stunning, crisply complex cologne absolue that balances layers of herbaceous green notes against a lovely, lilting jasmine accord that feels natural, fresh and warmly comforting. Jasmin Angelique opens with a crisp, spicy burst of Sicilian lemon, set against a fiery, energetic kick of Sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced by a floral yet fresh jasmine, resinous galbanum, and a lovely green fig note, which together give the impression of breathing deeply while walking through a meadow on a warm spring afternoon. This wondrous sensation lingers for hours, until slowly warming into the smooth, warm and light amber drydown. Vivid, green and aromatic, Jasmin Angelique is wholly unlike any jasmine fragrance we've tried before- and that's precisely what we love about it.","lemon, sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51029.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance houses announce jasmine scent necessarily move needle house dedicated solely cologne style compositions notably indolic sensual white flower might seem bit challenging luckily us jerome epinette atelier cologne done jasmin angelique stunning crisply complex cologne absolue balances layers herbaceous green notes lovely lilting jasmine accord feels natural fresh warmly comforting jasmin angelique opens crisp spicy burst sicilian lemon set fiery energetic kick sichaun pepper that's quickly balanced floral yet fresh jasmine resinous galbanum lovely green fig note together give impression breathing deeply walking meadow warm spring afternoon wondrous sensation lingers hours slowly warming smooth warm light amber drydown vivid green aromatic jasmin angelique wholly unlike jasmine fragrance we've tried that's precisely love,"lemon, sichuan pepper, angelique, jasmine, galbanum, fig, incense, white amber, tonka bean"
Iris Cendre Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir,"Enigmatic, elegant and enchanting, the iris is one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients- and also one of its most challenging. So when we heard that Naomi Goodsir's first-ever floral was to be named Iris Cendre (or ""Iris Ash""), our hearts began to flutter with anticipation of an Iris fragrance that might transcend convention and offer a bold new portrait of this beloved material. And even beyond our wildest dreams, Goodsir and perfumer Julien Rasquinet have delivered a bona fide masterpiece- a lush, warm, buttery interpretation of iris with a gorgeously restrained hint of smokiness that feels both wonderfully creative, and quintessentially Naomi Goodsir.
Before even the first spray, Iris Cendre affirms its rarity with a striking green color that results from its uniquely high concentration of true iris concrete, a property that gives the fragrance its striking depth and nuance. While the opening presents a crisp, delicately fruity burst of bergamot and spiced tangerine, the rich heart of buttery iris soon takes over, displaying a gorgeously evocative facet of the flower with warmer, more sultry tones than we've ever before found in an iris scent. A light veil of violet reinforces the floral depth, while a sensually smoky accord of cistus, tobacco and amber evokes the distinctly complex drydown of another Naomi Goodsir classic, Bois D'Ascese. The overall effect is both subtle and striking, a wholly unisex floral that seems to contain multitudes without ever raising its voice, feeling vivid and deep but also masterfully restrained. With Iris Cendre, Naomi Goodsir and Julien Rasquinet have redefined what we thought an iris scent could be and in doing so, created a new reference.","bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,enigmatic elegant enchanting iris one perfumery's treasured ingredients also one challenging heard naomi goodsir's first ever floral named iris cendre iris ash hearts began flutter anticipation iris fragrance might transcend convention offer bold new portrait beloved material even beyond wildest dreams goodsir perfumer julien rasquinet delivered bona fide masterpiece lush warm buttery interpretation iris gorgeously restrained hint smokiness feels wonderfully creative quintessentially naomi goodsir even first spray iris cendre affirms rarity striking green color results uniquely high concentration true iris concrete property gives fragrance striking depth nuance opening presents crisp delicately fruity burst bergamot spiced tangerine rich heart buttery iris soon takes displaying gorgeously evocative facet flower warmer sultry tones we've ever found iris scent light veil violet reinforces floral depth sensually smoky accord cistus tobacco amber evokes distinctly complex drydown another naomi goodsir classic bois d'ascese overall effect subtle striking wholly unisex floral seems contain multitudes without ever raising voice feeling vivid deep also masterfully restrained iris cendre naomi goodsir julien rasquinet redefined thought iris scent could created new reference,"bergamot, tangerine, orris butter, violet, amber, cistus, tobacco"
Bahiana Eau de Parfum,Maitre Parfumeur et Gantier,"Oh to be in Bahia, hypnotized by the incessant beat of the drums, dancing under the stars with a caipirinha in our hand. Sadly, we are here, instead. At least we have Bahiana, which lets us dream of hot Brazilian nights. A brilliant burst of sharp citrus fuses with exotic deep woods and coconut to create a fruity blend that is more dry than sweet. It reminds us of pineapple âÂ not drenched with syrup, but freshly cut, with a startling trace of green. As vivid as a caipirinha, and almost as intoxicating.","orange, caipirinha limon, mandarin, tagette, green leaf, rosewood, gaiac wood, elemi, amber, musk, coconut",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/29323.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oh bahia hypnotized incessant beat drums dancing stars caipirinha hand sadly instead least bahiana lets us dream hot brazilian nights brilliant burst sharp citrus fuses exotic deep woods coconut create fruity blend dry sweet reminds us pineapple drenched syrup freshly cut startling trace green vivid caipirinha almost intoxicating,"orange, caipirinha limon, mandarin, tagette, green leaf, rosewood, gaiac wood, elemi, amber, musk, coconut"
Incense Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville,"For the third entry in his joyfully creative Tauerville project, Andy Tauer turns his attention to an ingredient that his primary line has ample familiarity with: incense. And while Incense Flash's woods-and-incense motif seems to cover some familiar ground, we're pleased to report that this earthy, leathery, compulsively sniffable scent walks a deft line between comfortable and creative, with ample appeal for lovers of Andy's previous incense work and newcomers alike. As would befit a fragrance named Incense Flash, the incense buzzes from the very first spray, dry enough to bring out the natural earthiness of the Boswellia Serrata incense used, but supplemented with a subtly musky, woodsy sharpness- dare we say a hint of the famous Tauer signature? As Incense Flash dries, the incense lingers, now paired against a wonderfully evocative leather- rough and dusty, yet as it dries increasingly supple and smooth. What now lasts for hours is a new reference for incense scents, less forest, painter's studio or bazaar and more starlit, high desert vista. Distinct, compelling and easy to wear, Incense Flash is at once uniquely an Andy Tauer creation- and also something altogether new.","leather, musky woods, ambergris, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69202.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,third entry joyfully creative tauerville project andy tauer turns attention ingredient primary line ample familiarity incense incense flash's woods incense motif seems cover familiar ground we're pleased report earthy leathery compulsively sniffable scent walks deft line comfortable creative ample appeal lovers andy's previous incense work newcomers alike would befit fragrance named incense flash incense buzzes first spray dry enough bring natural earthiness boswellia serrata incense used supplemented subtly musky woodsy sharpness dare say hint famous tauer signature incense flash dries incense lingers paired wonderfully evocative leather rough dusty yet dries increasingly supple smooth lasts hours new reference incense scents less forest painter's studio bazaar starlit high desert vista distinct compelling easy wear incense flash uniquely andy tauer creation also something altogether new,"leather, musky woods, ambergris, incense"
Framboise Noire Eau de Parfum,Shay & Blue,"Like an aged wine in an ancient cellar, Framboise Noire is a testament to the darker side of berries and wood, a celebration of the complexity that can be achieved in pitch blackness. Opening with a note of rare black raspberries mixed with a handful of juicy red forest berries, Framboise Noir begins both sweet and nuanced, before a heart note of seductive iris adds floral depth and a modern touch. A base of rich white oud and dark, musky black woods increases the sensuality, igniting the palate and deepening the sophistication. Sweet, rich and more than a bit dangerous, Framboise Noire is an enticing invitation to discover what lurks in the darkness.","black raspberry, mixed berries, iris pallida, white oud, black woods",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70413.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like aged wine ancient cellar framboise noire testament darker side berries wood celebration complexity achieved pitch blackness opening note rare black raspberries mixed handful juicy red forest berries framboise noir begins sweet nuanced heart note seductive iris adds floral depth modern touch base rich white oud dark musky black woods increases sensuality igniting palate deepening sophistication sweet rich bit dangerous framboise noire enticing invitation discover lurks darkness,"black raspberry, mixed berries, iris pallida, white oud, black woods"
Halfeti Eau de Parfum,Penhaligons,"Sumptuous and mysterious, lush and spicy, Halfeti builds on the promise of the previous entries in Penhaligon's Trade Routes series by delivering an exotic and beautiful rose fragrance that sings with the luxuries of the 19th century's most rare and valuable trading commodities. Named for the gorgeous and exceedingly rare black roses found along the Euphrates river in Turkey, Halfeti takes this rose note- luscious, lightly fruity, fresh and rich- and sets it amongst notes of juicy, sharp grapefruit, fresh green vegetation, and a mouthwatering melange of culinary spices anchored with golden, redolent saffron. As the rose increases in intensity, joined by lightly indolic jasmine and fresh lily, a rich, regal base of leather, oud, patchouli and precious woods lends sophisticated depth, calling to mind a merchant ship returning to port, overflowing with priceless goods. Such is the balance of this exquisite fragrance that spicy and soft, lovely and dark, complex and comfortable all blend in perfect harmony, with that singularly beautiful rose standing tall in the middle.

Venetian Bergamot Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Bergamot- fresh, fruity, spicy and complex- is perhaps the most unsung hero of perfumery of all styles and histories. Without bergamot, eaux de cologne lose their snappy freshness, fougeres forego their bracing sharpness, and chypres fall into flat, heavy dullness. It's therefore only appropriate that Tom Ford's new Venetian Bergamot, a modern-facing blend of these renowned styles of fragrance, keeps the noble bergamot front and center, sweeping us off our feet with the versatility and vibrancy of Italian bergamot carefully supported in a lush, fresh, spicy blend of woods and florals that refreshes and intoxicates all at once. Delicately creamy magnolia and sweet, fleshy gardenia and ylang ylang embrace smooth, robust cedarwood and cashmeran, while a sweet/spicy duo of black and pink pepper dance above the ground, each aspect enforcing and complimenting an aspect of the exquisite bergamot oil at the top of it all.

La Vierge de Fer Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Serge Lutens has a history of playful names that subtly subvert the fragrances they're attached to, but naming a lush, gentle lily after a medieval torture device might take the cake. ""La Vierge de Fer,"" after all, translates to ""the iron maiden,"" that infamous spiked coffin more associated with heavy metal than French fragrance. But as always, there's a method to the madness, with La Vierge revealing itself to be a beautiful lily-led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening and lightly metallic incense base suggest the maiden's deadly spikes with a wink and a smile.
La Vierge de Fer opens, as we mentioned, with a bright dose of aldehydes, charging the concoction with tingling energy and subtle sweetness. As the floral heart warms, jasmine brings the luscious fullness, while lily provides the edges, fresh, green and yes, lightly metallic. This last, thematically appropriate element is further reinforced with the incense base, while the musk accentuates the sweetness that also carries throughout the life of this fragrance. Sure, we can see the subtleties that must have put a smile on the Serge Lutens team's faces when they chose to name this fragrance after the iron maiden. But to us, this gorgeous, sophisticated, easy to wear floral is the opposite of torture.","aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36153.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,serge lutens history playful names subtly subvert fragrances they're attached naming lush gentle lily medieval torture device might take cake la vierge de fer translates iron maiden infamous spiked coffin associated heavy metal french fragrance always there's method madness la vierge revealing beautiful lily led white floral whose sparkling aldehydic opening lightly metallic incense base suggest maiden's deadly spikes wink smile la vierge de fer opens mentioned bright dose aldehydes charging concoction tingling energy subtle sweetness floral heart warms jasmine brings luscious fullness lily provides edges fresh green yes lightly metallic last thematically appropriate element reinforced incense base musk accentuates sweetness also carries throughout life fragrance sure see subtleties must put smile serge lutens team's faces chose name fragrance iron maiden us gorgeous sophisticated easy wear floral opposite torture,"aldehydes, lily, jasmine, incense, white musk"

Mojave Ghost Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"In the xeric wilderness of the mojave desert, trees and vegetation more ancient than many civilizations defy conditions that prey on human vulnerability. The ghost flower is a rare species that dares to blossom above this baked, hard ground. Despite its arid surroundings and inability to produce nectar, the ghost flower, or mohavea confertiflora, maintains its perfect, majestic beauty and thrives year after year. In an astonishing feat of ingenuity, the flower uses mimicry to attract the pollinators of a neighboring plant species by developing markings that resemble those of a female bee, therefore attracting it and duping the male bee into following suit. This moving human-like behavior and captivating tale of survival lies in the foundation that inspired 'mojave ghost', an homage to this most bewitching flower.
Mojave Ghost opens with a familiar yet mysterious fruit note, like a pear grown on another planet. Languid and almost buttery ambrette and sandalwood facets smooth and stretch these slices of fruit into a golden desert sunset, with petals of violet and magnolia basking in its diminishing light. Warm woods and ambergris remain on the skin for hours, prolonging a magic desert twilight.","ambrette, sapodilla, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, ambergris, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64163.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,xeric wilderness mojave desert trees vegetation ancient many civilizations defy conditions prey human vulnerability ghost flower rare species dares blossom baked hard ground despite arid surroundings inability produce nectar ghost flower mohavea confertiflora maintains perfect majestic beauty thrives year year astonishing feat ingenuity flower uses mimicry attract pollinators neighboring plant species developing markings resemble female bee therefore attracting duping male bee following suit moving human like behavior captivating tale survival lies foundation inspired 'mojave ghost' homage bewitching flower mojave ghost opens familiar yet mysterious fruit note like pear grown another planet languid almost buttery ambrette sandalwood facets smooth stretch slices fruit golden desert sunset petals violet magnolia basking diminishing light warm woods ambergris remain skin hours prolonging magic desert twilight,"ambrette, sapodilla, violet, sandalwood, magnolia, ambergris, cedar"
Flowerhead Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"In the traditional Indian wedding, flower heads are strung together on giant leis, including Jaimala garlands which are exchanged between bride and groom as a token of mutual respect. Couples are often showered with petals by the groom's brother for spiritual protection. Flowers are abundant; from the mandap wedding canopy, which is entirely covered in exotic blooms, to the spiritual pooja rooms and verandahs, the explosion of colour is wildly celebratory and the scent is overwhelming.
Ben Gorham, the visionary behind Byredo, used his impression of a bride in a Traditional Indian wedding as his inspiration for Flowerhead. 'The idea of marrying someone you don't know was very interesting. There's anxiety and excitement, and I described this person as a 'flowerhead', because the bride is completely covered in floral hair arrangements.'
Flowerhead has definitely set our hearts a flutter. It's a bold yet modern white floral; on one hand, it uses the classic combination of sambac jasmine and tuberose for it's floral heart, but without the slightest touch of cream or indole usually associated with white florals. Instead, the dryer aspect of white petals is blended with with a green rose, tart lemon and cranberry. Angelica seed adds a celery-green herbal dimension. Flowerhead doesn't shy away from the the classic white floral silage or volume. In fact we find this to be one of Byredo's most robust compositions yet-- after a slow gorgeous drydown, Flowerhead softens to a lingering wisper of suede and ambergris.","angelica seeds, cranberries, lemon, sambac jasmine, rose petals, tuberose, suede ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,traditional indian wedding flower heads strung together giant leis including jaimala garlands exchanged bride groom token mutual respect couples often showered petals groom's brother spiritual protection flowers abundant mandap wedding canopy entirely covered exotic blooms spiritual pooja rooms verandahs explosion colour wildly celebratory scent overwhelming ben gorham visionary behind byredo used impression bride traditional indian wedding inspiration flowerhead 'the idea marrying someone know interesting there's anxiety excitement described person 'flowerhead' bride completely covered floral hair arrangements ' flowerhead definitely set hearts flutter bold yet modern white floral one hand uses classic combination sambac jasmine tuberose floral heart without slightest touch cream indole usually associated white florals instead dryer aspect white petals blended green rose tart lemon cranberry angelica seed adds celery green herbal dimension flowerhead shy away classic white floral silage volume fact find one byredo's robust compositions yet slow gorgeous drydown flowerhead softens lingering wisper suede ambergris,"angelica seeds, cranberries, lemon, sambac jasmine, rose petals, tuberose, suede ambergris"
Monoscent G Eau de Parfum,What We Do Is Secret,"What, exactly, is Galaxolide Super, the sole aromachemical responsible for Monoscent G? In simple terms, it's a synthetic ingredient with a light, clean, musky vibe that has been used in fragrance creation since standard Galaxolide was created in the 1960s- the powered-up ""Super"" version featuring light floral-powder tones came in 2007. In Monoscent G, Galaxolide Super finally steps out from behind the crush of perfume ingredients and stands alone. The result is a tantalizingly subtle skin-musk that can be either worn alone for a barely-there spritz of sexiness, or used quite effectively as a base layer for other fragrances, where it adds both longevity and an almost subconscious sensuality. However you choose to deploy it, Monoscent G is a secret weapon in any modern fragrance lover's arsenal.

Pegasus Eau de Parfum,Parfums de Marly,"Pegasus- the horse God, the heavenly stallion portrayed in Coustou's famed statue. A creature of such power, refinement and nobility that only a God himself would dare attempt to ride him. In this spirit, Parfums de Marly's Pegasus is, itself, fragrance nobility- a skillfully refined take on the fougere style featuring unexpected notes of almond and vanilla that give it unique lasting power and striking dignity. Pegasus opens with the aforementioned almond note- lightly sweet, somewhat bitter, and warm, given juicy heft by a more traditionally fougere-like bergamot. The heart of the fragrance further expands on the almonds' sweet, marzipan-like depth, while an unlisted floral accord (lavender and jasmine?)exudes gentle, refined masculinity. In the base, vanilla is the clear star of the show, replacing a traditional fougere's mossiness with creamy warmth supplemented by amber notes, while a light, sharp sandalwood keeps everything airy enough to still earn the genre. To read the notes of Pegasus is to wonder how it earns a categorization as a men's fougere- to smell it, on the other hand, is to be so swept up in its sophistication and majesty that you've no choice but to understand.","bergamot, heliotrope, spice, almond, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/70005.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,pegasus horse god heavenly stallion portrayed coustou's famed statue creature power refinement nobility god would dare attempt ride spirit parfums de marly's pegasus fragrance nobility skillfully refined take fougere style featuring unexpected notes almond vanilla give unique lasting power striking dignity pegasus opens aforementioned almond note lightly sweet somewhat bitter warm given juicy heft traditionally fougere like bergamot heart fragrance expands almonds' sweet marzipan like depth unlisted floral accord lavender jasmine exudes gentle refined masculinity base vanilla clear star show replacing traditional fougere's mossiness creamy warmth supplemented amber notes light sharp sandalwood keeps everything airy enough still earn genre read notes pegasus wonder earns categorization men's fougere smell hand swept sophistication majesty choice understand,"bergamot, heliotrope, spice, almond, amber, vanilla, sandalwood"

White Parfum Extrait,Puredistance,"What does happiness smell like? Surely, there are a million individual answers, and yet White, the result of Puredistance and Antoine Lie's quest to create a fragrance that would instantly evoke intense joy, glows with an undeniable, universal radiance. Born from the uncompromising quality of vision and material that Puredistance has become renowned for, White is much more than an ordinary bright, lush floral: it's a genuine work of breathtaking, yet nuanced, beauty that's impossible to dislike.
The true, joyous beauty of White lies in its structure, which neither conforms to the traditional top-heart-base note configuration, nor is it what we normally consider linear. Instead, White is a giddily rotating ensemble of gorgeously lush Rose de Mai, immaculate sandalwood, lightly potent vetyver, orris butter and patchouli, and exquisitely deep tonka bean. One sniff may distinctly carry orris' powdery violet-like essence, another, luscious full-bodied rose, the next, rich, vanillic tonka. It's the type of elegant sophistication we've grown to expect from Puredistance, a compliment that makes White no less amazing. If Puredistance's goal was to create a scent it would be impossible not to smile around, then we're happy to say they've succeeded with flying colors.","rose de mai, tonka bean absolute, orris absolute, sandalwood, bergamot, musk, vetiver, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53021.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,happiness smell like surely million individual answers yet white result puredistance antoine lie's quest create fragrance would instantly evoke intense joy glows undeniable universal radiance born uncompromising quality vision material puredistance become renowned white much ordinary bright lush floral genuine work breathtaking yet nuanced beauty that's impossible dislike true joyous beauty white lies structure neither conforms traditional top heart base note configuration normally consider linear instead white giddily rotating ensemble gorgeously lush rose de mai immaculate sandalwood lightly potent vetyver orris butter patchouli exquisitely deep tonka bean one sniff may distinctly carry orris' powdery violet like essence another luscious full bodied rose next rich vanillic tonka type elegant sophistication we've grown expect puredistance compliment makes white less amazing puredistance's goal create scent would impossible smile around we're happy say they've succeeded flying colors,"rose de mai, tonka bean absolute, orris absolute, sandalwood, bergamot, musk, vetiver, patchouli"

This scent evokes Cio Cio San's happiest days, opening with an exhilarating splash of yuzu, limette and ginger that is joined by a profusion of flowers. The first impression is that of walking into a garden in full bloom, but the heady peonies and cherry blossoms quickly become light and sheer as the exquisite sweetness at the heart of the fragrance appears. Lychee is an incredibly distinctive note that blends delectable juicy fruit with a soft, rose-like quality--it is both instantly familiar and impossible to place, like a candy eaten in a dream. A watercolor wash of oolong tea adds to this wistful nostalgia, creating an ethereal finish that is both clean and vibrant. Like a haiku that can conjure up an entire scene with a few well-chosen details, Cio Cio San is a serene meditation that evokes the springtime and romance of old Japan with heart-twisting clarity.","yuzu, limette, lemon, ginger, grapefruit, cherry blossom, peony, lychee, oolong tea, gaiac, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36518.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,picture stage set paper lanterns parasols rustling silk kimonos trees bursting cherry blossoms heightened glowing version far place might see opera find endearing ever hopeful cio cio san might know better madame butterfly forget moment tragic ending think instead heroine lives happy bubble memory confection young love nostalgia lovely fragile namesake scent evokes cio cio san's happiest days opening exhilarating splash yuzu limette ginger joined profusion flowers first impression walking garden full bloom heady peonies cherry blossoms quickly become light sheer exquisite sweetness heart fragrance appears lychee incredibly distinctive note blends delectable juicy fruit soft rose like quality instantly familiar impossible place like candy eaten dream watercolor wash oolong tea adds wistful nostalgia creating ethereal finish clean vibrant like haiku conjure entire scene well chosen details cio cio san serene meditation evokes springtime romance old japan heart twisting clarity,"yuzu, limette, lemon, ginger, grapefruit, cherry blossom, peony, lychee, oolong tea, gaiac, cedarwood, musk"

Grisette Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"In the Belle Epoque, a grisette referred to the stylish young women employed in droves in Paris' booming sewing workshops. A fixture in the bars of Montmartre and the guinguettes on the Marne, the grisette was flirtatious, fun-loving, liberated, and full of the joie de vivre that inspired so much of the era's famed art and culture. Now as the newest fragrance from the venerable house of Lubin, Grisette is poised to capture the essence of these beautiful, industrious coquettes with a crisp, lush, spirited fragrance that you can hardly sniff without a smile. Grisette opens with bright citrus notes of grapefruit and bergamot, evoking the sun shining along the Seine as young roses- Moroccan and Bulgarian, presented as lovely and unpretentious as can be- wafts across the waters. Using for the first time an alcolate of rose concrete, Lubin has managed to preserve the most volatile and lively of the rose notes, which mingle with a touch of grapefruit to positively dance off the skin. Discreet heart notes of orris oil are cloaked in incense and hints of cedar wood with touches of musk and amber melt into the scent of Madagascan vanilla absolute.

Sans Un Mot Extrait de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"Picture a perfume that parts the heavens, that stops men and women alike dead in their tracks, that grants the woman who wears it the power to suspend an entire airport terminal or street corner frozen in rapture, eyes suddenly darting towards the source of such stunning beauty? In French, they call such an experience un ange passe, literally, 'an angel passes.' And with Sans Un Mot, Jovoy has created a new great French powdery floral.
Sans un Mot opens with a spicy burst of pink peppercorn and zesty mandarin before moving into the rich, neo-classical heart of rose, ylang, and juicy blackcurrant. A finish of powdery musk and vanilla grounds it firmly in the tradition of classic French floral orientals, while an unexpectedly modern dose of soft woods and violet remind us that this is indeed the 21st century.

Vanilla Flash Eau de Parfum,Tauerville,"The success of Rose Flash- so fresh, so wonderfully wearable, and yet so different from the Tauer scents we already knew and loved- had us salivating at the prospect of future Tauerville releases. Now, with Vanilla Flash, Andy Tauer has turned his considerable talent and imagination towards the goal of creating a vanilla fragrance he'd actually like to wear- meaning sickly sweet, overly creamy or referentially foody was out the window.

Musc Extrait Extrait de Parfum,Bruno Acampora,"Is the new Musc Extrait the perfect form for Bruno Acampora's widely beloved Musc? After all, while the classic oil is still renowned for its originality, depth and jaw-dropping longevity, and the Eau de Bruno spray is similarly worshipped for its versatility, sensuality and warmth, the Extrait encompasses all of this and more. Still steadfastly true to the deep, damp earthiness of the opening and the toe-curling pleasure of the richly comforting drydown that follows, Musc Extrait ups the ante with a satisfying floral sweetness that appears after the first spray and lingers through the gorgeous evolution that follows. It's everything you know and love about Bruno Musc- only even better. ""The Extrait of perfume is the holistic expression of Acampora's collection.

Precision & Grace Eau de Parfum,The Beautiful Mind Series,"For Volume 2 of this fascinating collaboration with exceptional women from diverse fields, perfumer Geza Schoen chose to team with Polina Semionova, an internationally-feted ballet dancer. ;I was fascinated by what goes on in the mind of a great dancer while she's dancing,' says Schoen, 'in the precision she must have to express the grace.' The result is Precision & Grace, a stunningly balanced modern fragrance that marries uplifting fruity notes to soft florals, all perched atop a warm, deceptively strong woodsy drydown. I wanted to have pear and plum because they remind me of summer in the Russian countryside of my childhood,' says Semionova. The top note of Williams pear brings forth a crisp, juicy greenness. The heart of the fragrance is an accord of Egyptian jasmine with plum, meant to evoke the lightness of a ballerina's gossamer costume. Finally the base of Precision & Grace, a powerful yet subtle real sandalwood and musk combination that shows the tremendous physical strength that a dancer must possess in order to project the sublimely delicate beauty visible to the audience. Breezy and feminine, yet hiding a deeper core of power and strength, Precision & Grace is another unique and fascinating triumph for The Beautiful Mind Series.","williams pear, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, jasmine, plum, osmanthus, rose, mimosa, pink pepper, freesia, violet, sandalwood, myrrh, moss, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,volume fascinating collaboration exceptional women diverse fields perfumer geza schoen chose team polina semionova internationally feted ballet dancer fascinated goes mind great dancer dancing ' says schoen 'in precision must express grace ' result precision grace stunningly balanced modern fragrance marries uplifting fruity notes soft florals perched atop warm deceptively strong woodsy drydown wanted pear plum remind summer russian countryside childhood ' says semionova top note williams pear brings forth crisp juicy greenness heart fragrance accord egyptian jasmine plum meant evoke lightness ballerina's gossamer costume finally base precision grace powerful yet subtle real sandalwood musk combination shows tremendous physical strength dancer must possess order project sublimely delicate beauty visible audience breezy feminine yet hiding deeper core power strength precision grace another unique fascinating triumph beautiful mind series,"williams pear, bergamot, mandarin, lemon, jasmine, plum, osmanthus, rose, mimosa, pink pepper, freesia, violet, sandalwood, myrrh, moss, amber"
Fauna Parfum,Regime des Fleurs,"An enchanted oudh for creatures of the night, Fauna paints a picture of a nocturnal wonderland teeming with magical life radiating in the faint glow of the stars. Unleashed by the retirement of the waking world, creatures great and small embark on their nightly routine, their raw animalic odors softened by the ghostly night-blooming cereus, the greenness of the forest, a tantalizing vein of delicate spices that lingers in the atmosphere. Genuine Laotion and Indonesian agarwood extractions howl, and rich albino musk howls back.

Freeworld Parfum,Regime des Fleurs,"What, precisely, defines an 'American Oriental,' as Ezra Woods and Alia Raza have chosen to categorize freeworld? We think a single sniff might be all you need to understand- while freeworld features a positively intoxicating melange of spices and a warm, earthy base that would more than qualify it as an oriental, it crackles with a youthful exuberance and energy that paint a dramatically more upbeat, casual picture than the snarling, sultry grand dames of classic European takes on the genre. With bright, lemony geranium standing in for more opulent florals, sparkling aldehydes and fizzy citrus adding light and levitation, and a mouthwatering nutmeg and vanilla blend evoking memories of ice-cold root beer on a sweltering summer night, freeworld feels as American as New York pizza, apple pie or baseball- a few other things we once borrowed from overseas.","geranium, citruses, neroli, nutmeg, coriander, sandalwood, vanilla, aldehydes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,precisely defines 'american oriental ' ezra woods alia raza chosen categorize freeworld think single sniff might need understand freeworld features positively intoxicating melange spices warm earthy base would qualify oriental crackles youthful exuberance energy paint dramatically upbeat casual picture snarling sultry grand dames classic european takes genre bright lemony geranium standing opulent florals sparkling aldehydes fizzy citrus adding light levitation mouthwatering nutmeg vanilla blend evoking memories ice cold root beer sweltering summer night freeworld feels american new york pizza apple pie baseball things borrowed overseas,"geranium, citruses, neroli, nutmeg, coriander, sandalwood, vanilla, aldehydes"
Room 237 Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"It's not everyday that we get a fragrance based on one of the most terrifying films ever made, but that's precisely what Room 237 is- an homage to Kubrick's classic adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining, where the pastel-green bathroom of the titular room shelters an unspeakable evil. It's not exactly the kind of concept one attempts lightly, but Bruno Fazzolari has delivered something truly unique, a soft, enveloping, soapy-green scent that powerfully evokes a feeling of dreamlike confusion that's both wearable and, dare we say, at least a little bit disturbing. Like its source material itself, Room 237 doesn't smash you over the head with its more transgressive elements, but rather it draws you further into the room with Kubrickian deliberation- clean musk and resin flow together with synthetic plastic and vinyl notes that assert themselves in waves, keeping you sniffing at your wrist even though you know something about it feels wrong. And just as Jack Torrance couldn't see the truth of Room 237's lone resident until he was at the edge of her bathtub and it was far too late, so too will you fall prey to this fascinatingly constructed fragrance. Horror fans, fragrance adventurers- you absolutely have to try this for yourself.","angelica, flea bane, estragon, costus, oppoponax, olibanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69303.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,everyday get fragrance based one terrifying films ever made that's precisely room homage kubrick's classic adaptation stephen king's shining pastel green bathroom titular room shelters unspeakable evil exactly kind concept one attempts lightly bruno fazzolari delivered something truly unique soft enveloping soapy green scent powerfully evokes feeling dreamlike confusion that's wearable dare say least little bit disturbing like source material room smash head transgressive elements rather draws room kubrickian deliberation clean musk resin flow together synthetic plastic vinyl notes assert waves keeping sniffing wrist even though know something feels wrong jack torrance see truth room 's lone resident edge bathtub far late fall prey fascinatingly constructed fragrance horror fans fragrance adventurers absolutely try,"angelica, flea bane, estragon, costus, oppoponax, olibanum"
Monserrat Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"Like any true beauty, Monserrat is so much more than just a pretty face. Which is to say, while you may find yourself swooning over its luscious, brightly fruity opening, this is no simplistic department store fruity floral. It's a Bruno Fazzolari, and that means that what starts as a straightforward- if mouthwatering- burst of juicy peach and green grapefruit soon grows far more literate and complex with a delicately indolic jasmine and an unexpected plaster note that recontextualizes all that vibrant fruitiness into something delightfully dry- as if you were looking at a Cezanne still life so masterfully done that you find yourself wishing you could take a bite. Fruity florals often get a bad rap, and not always undeservedly. But if they were all as clever, innovative and compelling as Monserrat, even the most die-hard critic might be singing a different tune.","pink grapefruit, green leaves, carrot seed, osmanthus, jasmine, white musk, setting plaster",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69305.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like true beauty monserrat much pretty face say may find swooning luscious brightly fruity opening simplistic department store fruity floral bruno fazzolari means starts straightforward mouthwatering burst juicy peach green grapefruit soon grows far literate complex delicately indolic jasmine unexpected plaster note recontextualizes vibrant fruitiness something delightfully dry looking cezanne still life masterfully done find wishing could take bite fruity florals often get bad rap always undeservedly clever innovative compelling monserrat even die hard critic might singing different tune,"pink grapefruit, green leaves, carrot seed, osmanthus, jasmine, white musk, setting plaster"
Sunshine Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Bright and joyful, Amouage's exuberant new fragrance shines like a desert metropolis at high noon. Sunshine opens with glowingly youthful top notes of almond, sweet, floral davana and mouthwatering blackcurrant liqueur, igniting the senses and infusing the wearer with passionate energy. The heart of the fragrance reveals a sophisticated floral bouquet- luscious osmanthus, fresh magnolia, rich jasmine, all smoothed together with a warm, light vanilla that enchants us with its playful, yet complex, innocence. A base of wonderfully earthy patchouli, aromatic cade, woody papyrus and savory blond tobacco add richness and longevity without sacrificing an ounce of delightfully airy floral character. Presented in a beautifully iridescent yellow bottle, Sunshine couldn't be a more appropriate name- this is warm, sophisticated happiness in a fragrance, and we're honored to be one of the few select retailers on the planet to offer this joyful treasure.","blackcurrant liqueur, almond, davana, osmanthus, jasmine, vanilla, magnolia, cade, patchouli, blond tobacco, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41862.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bright joyful amouage's exuberant new fragrance shines like desert metropolis high noon sunshine opens glowingly youthful top notes almond sweet floral davana mouthwatering blackcurrant liqueur igniting senses infusing wearer passionate energy heart fragrance reveals sophisticated floral bouquet luscious osmanthus fresh magnolia rich jasmine smoothed together warm light vanilla enchants us playful yet complex innocence base wonderfully earthy patchouli aromatic cade woody papyrus savory blond tobacco add richness longevity without sacrificing ounce delightfully airy floral character presented beautifully iridescent yellow bottle sunshine appropriate name warm sophisticated happiness fragrance we're honored one select retailers planet offer joyful treasure,"blackcurrant liqueur, almond, davana, osmanthus, jasmine, vanilla, magnolia, cade, patchouli, blond tobacco, papyrus"
Lampblack Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"The sudden, eerily calm darkness before a ferocious storm. The hushed, electric silence when the lights cut out and the curtain has yet to rise. The colors and shapes that dance in front of our eyes when we wake in the middle of the night and try to focus in the pitch darkness. This is what Bruno Fazzolari has captured in Lampblack, last year's much-buzzed-over cult sensation. Inspired by the smell of India ink, this triumphantly exciting fragrance is transparent and earthy and colorful and wholly unique, and we couldn't be more thrilled to offer it to you. Lampblack opens with a bracing citrus note, sweet orange coming up against bitter grapefruit, with a nose-tingling, borderline metallic black pepper asserting itself and establishing an off-kilter modernism to the whole affair. As the inky cypriol and earthy vetiver take over, the air continues to crackle with anticipatory energy, revealing the hidden depths of the darkness that still envelops the fragrance. Dark yet colorful, simple yet intricate, Lampblack embraces its contradictions for a modern, boldly creative scent that isn't just noticeably unique, but also uniquely easy to wear.","sweet orange, black pepper, bitter grapefruit, nagamotha, benzoin, vetiver, shadow",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69300.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sudden eerily calm darkness ferocious storm hushed electric silence lights cut curtain yet rise colors shapes dance front eyes wake middle night try focus pitch darkness bruno fazzolari captured lampblack last year's much buzzed cult sensation inspired smell india ink triumphantly exciting fragrance transparent earthy colorful wholly unique thrilled offer lampblack opens bracing citrus note sweet orange coming bitter grapefruit nose tingling borderline metallic black pepper asserting establishing kilter modernism whole affair inky cypriol earthy vetiver take air continues crackle anticipatory energy revealing hidden depths darkness still envelops fragrance dark yet colorful simple yet intricate lampblack embraces contradictions modern boldly creative scent noticeably unique also uniquely easy wear,"sweet orange, black pepper, bitter grapefruit, nagamotha, benzoin, vetiver, shadow"
Five Eau de Parfum,Bruno Fazzolari,"As the first of his perfumes to be featured in a gallery alongside his paintings, Bruno Fazzolari paired Five with â vivid and lively paintings in primary colors... lit by strong fluorescent lights.' One sniff of this brisk, crisply assertive citrus/herbal/woods fragrance and the association becomes clear. Five is almost a traditional cologne- bright, fresh, and vibrantly spiced- but like the otherworldly fluorescents casting their own character on a painting, there's something in the balance of the fragrance, and in the lightly mineralic touches, that forces one to see the whole thing slightly askew. Aromatic rosemary mingles with a heavy dose of petitgrain and a 'high altitude' accord to give a robustly ozonic characteristic, as if pure oxygen was pumping from Five's otherwise traditionally composed heart. Like the gallery lights set up to deliberately alter your perception of the painting, Five is the traditional cologne born anew.","lemon, red mandarin, bergamot, neroli, rosemary, petitgrain, sweet woods, mineral, saltwater notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first perfumes featured gallery alongside paintings bruno fazzolari paired five vivid lively paintings primary colors lit strong fluorescent lights ' one sniff brisk crisply assertive citrus/herbal/woods fragrance association becomes clear five almost traditional cologne bright fresh vibrantly spiced like otherworldly fluorescents casting character painting there's something balance fragrance lightly mineralic touches forces one see whole thing slightly askew aromatic rosemary mingles heavy dose petitgrain 'high altitude' accord give robustly ozonic characteristic pure oxygen pumping five's otherwise traditionally composed heart like gallery lights set deliberately alter perception painting five traditional cologne born anew,"lemon, red mandarin, bergamot, neroli, rosemary, petitgrain, sweet woods, mineral, saltwater notes"
Tempted Muse Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics,"Inspired by mythical ambrosia, the dessert of the gods, Tempted Muse is an irresistible fruity nectar - as sweet and sensual as it is bright and innocent. Perfumer Tanja Bochnig envisioned a drowsy-eyed muse waking up on a sunny morning in a flower covered meadow, still ""drunken on nectar and love"", considering stealing a kiss from her sleeping lover. Tempted Muse opens like a sunrise - sparkling and warm - with grapefruit, frangipani and tuberose. The sweet freshness is balanced with balmy white florals and rose in the heart; and deepened by honeyed tonka, vanilla and sandalwood in the base. Perhaps the flirtiest scent we've smelled from April Aromatics, and we're smitten.","frangipani, tuberose, jasmine, rose otto, tonka bean, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, pink grapefruit, vanilla, anis fruit accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65812.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired mythical ambrosia dessert gods tempted muse irresistible fruity nectar sweet sensual bright innocent perfumer tanja bochnig envisioned drowsy eyed muse waking sunny morning flower covered meadow still drunken nectar love considering stealing kiss sleeping lover tempted muse opens like sunrise sparkling warm grapefruit frangipani tuberose sweet freshness balanced balmy white florals rose heart deepened honeyed tonka vanilla sandalwood base perhaps flirtiest scent we've smelled april aromatics we're smitten,"frangipani, tuberose, jasmine, rose otto, tonka bean, sandalwood, ylang-ylang, pink grapefruit, vanilla, anis fruit accord"
La Religieuse Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"At turns delicate and animalic, pure and carnal, jasmine is rightfully considered one of perfumery's most versatile and valued notes. Both reverent and blasphemous, La Religieuse ('the nun') uses its jasmine to paint a portrait of a woman in full, where sweet and comforting give way to hidden depths of animalic desire, and ultimately, to freedom. La Religieuse opens with a gourmand flourish, as the fresh, lightly green jasmine combines with sweet, sugared mimosa and smooth incense to evoke imagery of a saintly servant of god, pure in her devotion and intentions, bringing comfort and joy to those under her care. But as it evolves, and a more animalic civet note begins to coax out the other side of the jasmine, we realize that this woman has her own desires, her own fantasies, and her own yearning to escape the life that has been given to her. While the sweetness lingers, the incense now feels dirtier, the musk sexier. La Religieuse never goes fully down and dirty, but the transition is thrillingly palpable: our heroine, while she might never go completely wild, is no longer content to be anyone's silent bride. Once again, Serge Lutens has delivered us a gorgeous, encompassing fragrance that tells a story we won't soon forget.","jasmine, incense, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36152.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,turns delicate animalic pure carnal jasmine rightfully considered one perfumery's versatile valued notes reverent blasphemous la religieuse 'the nun' uses jasmine paint portrait woman full sweet comforting give way hidden depths animalic desire ultimately freedom la religieuse opens gourmand flourish fresh lightly green jasmine combines sweet sugared mimosa smooth incense evoke imagery saintly servant god pure devotion intentions bringing comfort joy care evolves animalic civet note begins coax side jasmine realize woman desires fantasies yearning escape life given sweetness lingers incense feels dirtier musk sexier la religieuse never goes fully dirty transition thrillingly palpable heroine might never go completely wild longer content anyone's silent bride serge lutens delivered us gorgeous encompassing fragrance tells story soon forget,"jasmine, incense, civet"
Rose Flash Parfum Extrait,Tauerville,"While we've never had trouble getting excited about a new fragrance from Andy Tauer, we have to admit we weren't sure exactly what might make the first entry from Tauerville different from the flagship Tauer Perfumes we know and love. But then we tried the immaculately composed, surprisingly naturalistic Rose Flash, a fragrance quintessentially Andy Tauer in its reverence for both subject and wearer but made with an entirely different sort of artistic flourish, and we instantly understood. Whether you've loved everything he's ever made or not, or if you simply love a beautifully constructed rose scent, Rose Flash is not to be missed.
As part of the grand Tauerville experiment, it is Mr. Tauer's wish not to list the notes, rather, to let the fragrance speak for itself. But what we can tell you is that Rose Flash is a tribute to the gorgeous fullness of a rose still growing- spicy, creamy, green, luscious, all aligned in a wonderful balance that never isolates any of these disparate elements but rather allows them to shine through together.

Bal D'Afrique Roll-on Oil Perfume Oil,BYREDO,"Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent. Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself. A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupeon of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub â sweet and adorable, but it still has claws. Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy.

Gypsy Water Hair Perfume,BYREDO,"BYREDO presents a hair perfume collection that invites you to care for and delicately scent the hair in one sensuous beautifying gesture. Enjoy the uplifting power of long lasting scents as they subtly diffuse throughout the day, amplified by the natural movement of the hair. Each hair perfume combines one of BYREDO's signature scents with a unique silicone and polymer formula to create a light, invisible veil designed to leave the hair nourished and luminous whilst divinely scented.
This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy â strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire â golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top. This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous.","bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64168.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,byredo presents hair perfume collection invites care delicately scent hair one sensuous beautifying gesture enjoy uplifting power long lasting scents subtly diffuse throughout day amplified natural movement hair hair perfume combines one byredo's signature scents unique silicone polymer formula create light invisible veil designed leave hair nourished luminous whilst divinely scented entrancing shape shifter one popular fragrances byredo line understand opening crisp outdoorsy strong vibrant citrus cool juniper sharp pine needles floating incense sweet earthiness orris help set scene camping inky deep blue sky studded brilliant stars surrounded pine trees hint smoke cutting chilly night air wears skin warm elements begin flicker beneath cool sharp ones like glowing embers campfire golden amber creamy vanilla luscious sandalwood warm soft dreamy skin scent emerges still lovely cool traces juniper lemon incense wafting top soft amber coziness beloved cashmere sweater last worn bonfire winter solstice traces smoke pine night air threads danger long wild night remembered warm safe place richly evocative absolutely gorgeous,"bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood"

An effortlessly lovely ode to the color white. Blanche opens with the crystalline sharpness of aldehydes, and then eases into a gentle white floral washed with soft sandalwood and transparent musk. Blanche is as light as a bubble floating on a warm summer wind and as clean as the steam from a long, hot shower. This is definitely in the family of freshly laundered scents, but it has a delicious warmth at its core that sets it apart. The ephemeral sweetness of the violet is anchored with the delectable milky richness of the sandalwood. Blanche does not bring to mind harsh detergents or astringent cleansers, but rather the creamy lather of French-milled soap on clean, wet skin. As sheer and weightless as silk chiffon, you could wrap yourself in it and it would still read as delicate and airy. A classic and elegant rendering of the concept of 'clean', it balances the brisk, fresh elements with soft, sensual ones. Pure and beautiful.","white rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64169.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,byredo presents hair perfume collection invites care delicately scent hair one sensuous beautifying gesture enjoy uplifting power long lasting scents subtly diffuse throughout day amplified natural movement hair hair perfume combines one byredo's signature scents unique silicone polymer formula create light invisible veil designed leave hair nourished luminous whilst divinely scented effortlessly lovely ode color white blanche opens crystalline sharpness aldehydes eases gentle white floral washed soft sandalwood transparent musk blanche light bubble floating warm summer wind clean steam long hot shower definitely family freshly laundered scents delicious warmth core sets apart ephemeral sweetness violet anchored delectable milky richness sandalwood blanche bring mind harsh detergents astringent cleansers rather creamy lather french milled soap clean wet skin sheer weightless silk chiffon could wrap would still read delicate airy classic elegant rendering concept 'clean' balances brisk fresh elements soft sensual ones pure beautiful,"white rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk"

Laudano Nero Extrait de Parfum,Tiziana Terenzi,"Paris on a rainy autumn day: warm rain beating on slate rooftops, stone streets lit by dim lights. A small fire at the crossroads of Montmartre heats musicians and acrobats, waiting for the tourists to return. The magical atmosphere is steeped in precious scents that echo this timeless place: an unusual explosion of absinthe-like camphor, a swell of rich labdanum and cognac, a strong vein of precious woods.

Kedu Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"Kedu, nicknamed 'the garden of Java' in Indonesia, is a plain bordered by a volcano. Its soil, which has been made fertile by the ash, is sacred. Glossy green palm trees nonchalantly rub shoulders with one-horned rhinoceros, giant flowers in changing colours, prehistoric buffalo and bent-backed pilgrims.
Tradition has it that you can purify your soul by throwing sesame seeds â one seed for each passion â into one of the flaming domes. By capturing this unique ingredient alongside a beautifully vibrant grapefruit note, Kedu whisks us away to one of the world's most unique locations.
Kedu opens with that grapefruit essence, tart, juicy and bright, fleshed out further with supporting notes of citrus and mate. Peppery green freesia explodes like the heat of the volcano, warming the sesame for a composition both floral and fresh but with a toasted complexity. If the holy site of Kedu represents purification, then the fragrance is the moments thereafter: light, bright, vibrant and free.","grapefruit, neroli, mandarin, mate absolute, freesia, rose, peony, sesame absolute, white musk, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69111.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kedu nicknamed 'the garden java' indonesia plain bordered volcano soil made fertile ash sacred glossy green palm trees nonchalantly rub shoulders one horned rhinoceros giant flowers changing colours prehistoric buffalo bent backed pilgrims tradition purify soul throwing sesame seeds one seed passion one flaming domes capturing unique ingredient alongside beautifully vibrant grapefruit note kedu whisks us away one world's unique locations kedu opens grapefruit essence tart juicy bright fleshed supporting notes citrus mate peppery green freesia explodes like heat volcano warming sesame composition floral fresh toasted complexity holy site kedu represents purification fragrance moments thereafter light bright vibrant free,"grapefruit, neroli, mandarin, mate absolute, freesia, rose, peony, sesame absolute, white musk, moss"

Lalibela Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"A place of pilgrimage and celebration, the ancient city of Lalibela in Ethiopa is known for its twelve stunning churches, hewn from solid rock in the 12th and 13th centuries. Now, MEMO and perfumer Alienor Massenet present this breathtakingly mysterious locale in a fragrance both mystifying and comforting, a full-bodied incense floral where Western ritual meets the delectably exotic, resulting in a fragrance that exists somewhere between earthly and divine- much like the city itself. Lalibela opens with a burst of patchouli-inflected spiciness and a compellingly mouthwatering coconut and orchid combination that feels as mystical as it does gourmand. A full-bodied rose adds to the spicy-smooth bouquet, while the incense walks the line between churchy and far-flung. To the pilgrims who have endured the grueling journey, their joyous fervor on reaching their holy destination can only be described as ecstatic. With Lalibela, MEMO delivers a similarly ecstatic experience- no pilgrimage necessary.","coconut orchid, rose, jasmine absolute, patchouli, rockrose, vanilla, tobacco, frankincense, labdanum resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,place pilgrimage celebration ancient city lalibela ethiopa known twelve stunning churches hewn solid rock th th centuries memo perfumer alienor massenet present breathtakingly mysterious locale fragrance mystifying comforting full bodied incense floral western ritual meets delectably exotic resulting fragrance exists somewhere earthly divine much like city lalibela opens burst patchouli inflected spiciness compellingly mouthwatering coconut orchid combination feels mystical gourmand full bodied rose adds spicy smooth bouquet incense walks line churchy far flung pilgrims endured grueling journey joyous fervor reaching holy destination described ecstatic lalibela memo delivers similarly ecstatic experience pilgrimage necessary,"coconut orchid, rose, jasmine absolute, patchouli, rockrose, vanilla, tobacco, frankincense, labdanum resin"
Shams Oud,MEMO,"Legend has it that the Persian god Mithras climbs into his gold-covered chariot at dawn and whips his horses forward to pull the sun across the sky until dusk. But then at nightfall, the sun is swallowed, only to return the following morning. With Shams Oud, MEMO celebrates this cycle of life, death and rebirth with a vibrantly spiced, intoxicatingly warm and woodsy fragrance that shines as bright as the sun itself.
Shams Oud opens with a sunrise of pepper, ginger and saffron, dazzling with complexity and energy. As the sun rises higher in the sky, its warmth increases, represented here by cypriol, styrax, and a lovely, luminescent oud that showcases a facet often underrepresented- its potential for an almost narcotic, powdery woodsiness. With knockout sillage and a gorgeous, enveloping profile, Shams Oud will have you sniffing your wrist from now until the sun is ready to repeat its journey again tomorrow.","pepper, rose, ginger, saffron, cypriol heart, cashmeran, tonka bean, tolu balsam absolute, styrax absolute, labdanum absolute, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,legend persian god mithras climbs gold covered chariot dawn whips horses forward pull sun across sky dusk nightfall sun swallowed return following morning shams oud memo celebrates cycle life death rebirth vibrantly spiced intoxicatingly warm woodsy fragrance shines bright sun shams oud opens sunrise pepper ginger saffron dazzling complexity energy sun rises higher sky warmth increases represented cypriol styrax lovely luminescent oud showcases facet often underrepresented potential almost narcotic powdery woodsiness knockout sillage gorgeous enveloping profile shams oud sniffing wrist sun ready repeat journey tomorrow,"pepper, rose, ginger, saffron, cypriol heart, cashmeran, tonka bean, tolu balsam absolute, styrax absolute, labdanum absolute, oud"
Granada Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"A feminine white floral with hidden complexities, Granada is an ultra romantic, surprisingly sensual late night dance through the gardens of the Alhambra. Inspired by late evenings beneath the walls of the famed red castle, the nighttime air redolent with Andalusian jasmine, Granada seduces us with a lightly resinous mix of clean and dirty florals that balance purity and carnality with expert precision. Granada opens sweet and bright, with bergamot and African orange flower balancing atop a delightfully dry grenadine note. The jasmine emerges, first virginally clean, then lightly indolic, its transition smoothed with a hazy heliotrope. A delicately woodsy base of tonka, vanilla and musks gives longevity and swings the balance back towards sexiness. Like Spain itself, Granada proves itself complex enough to represent many different facets of beauty.","oil bergamot, pomegranate, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, heliotrope, musk, amber wood accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,feminine white floral hidden complexities granada ultra romantic surprisingly sensual late night dance gardens alhambra inspired late evenings beneath walls famed red castle nighttime air redolent andalusian jasmine granada seduces us lightly resinous mix clean dirty florals balance purity carnality expert precision granada opens sweet bright bergamot african orange flower balancing atop delightfully dry grenadine note jasmine emerges first virginally clean lightly indolic transition smoothed hazy heliotrope delicately woodsy base tonka vanilla musks gives longevity swings balance back towards sexiness like spain granada proves complex enough represent many different facets beauty,"oil bergamot, pomegranate, orange blossom, jasmine sambac, heliotrope, musk, amber wood accord"
Moon Fever,MEMO,"Is Moon Fever the fragrance of an imaginary safari on the mysterious dark side of the moon, as MEMO's promotional concept suggests? Or does it perhaps simply represent the multitude of stars visible in the perpetual dusk of the Serengeti night, where the planet's most majestic wildlife stares up at the same brilliant tapestry that you do? Either way, there's only one word appropriate to describe the crisp depths of Moon Fever: luminous. Moon Fever draws you in with a crisp, full citrus opening, blending fresh juicy mandarin with tart grapefruit, bright lemon and a lovely bitter orange for a citrus blend that's unexpectedly cool and full-bodied. The lightly earthy heart of verbena, primrose, vetiver and sage gives an almost tea-like smoothness, keeping the enchanting contrast between the black night sky and the sparkling stars as an enrapturing tonka bean drydown connects earth to heaven.

Luxor Oud,MEMO,"The gateway of Luxor is humanity's oldest prayer site, a place where time stands still on the banks of the Nile. Under the shade of the colossus Ramses II, roses and fruits grow wild amongst the temple stones. Luxor Oud presents this majestic, mystical place in all of its balance between the ancient and the natural, freshness and sensuality vibrating in harmony with deep, resinous wood. Luxor Oud's balance comes from the classic marriage of rose and oud; in this case, a lush mixture of rose absolute given juicy fullness from essence of mandarin. Against this backdrop, the marvelous oud accord- robust and full-bodied with not a hint of medicinal artificiality- exudes quiet power.

Irish Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"It's one of those icy, biting mornings. The sun scarcely manages to break through the heavy grey clouds. The air is crisp and dry, and the wind slips beneath my clothes. The North wind whips the grass that sticks to my boots. I walk into the stable and swing open the wooden tack room doors, freeing the burning scent of leather, wood, amber and honey. Its age-old odor stands out sharply in the frozen morning air. My horse whinnies softly. It's the smell of her freedom. The leather gathers in the wind, the grass warms with the wood. Irish Leather gallops off into the horizon.'
MEMO co-founder John Molloy is understandably proud of his rural Irish upbringing, and Irish Leather, the first of MEMO's Cuirs Nomades series, positively sings of Ireland's rustic beauty. Opening notes of juniper, pink pepper and clary sage whisk us away to the wild countryside, while the leather- sharp, well-worn and deeply animalic- gives us the barn, the saddle and the horse all at once. Comforting yet forlorn, stark yet vibrantly beautiful, Irish Leather is among the most wonderfully wearable leathers we've ever experienced.","pink pepper, clary sage, juniper berry, green mate absolute, flouve, iris concrete, tonka bean absolute, leather, birch, amber accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one icy biting mornings sun scarcely manages break heavy grey clouds air crisp dry wind slips beneath clothes north wind whips grass sticks boots walk stable swing open wooden tack room doors freeing burning scent leather wood amber honey age old odor stands sharply frozen morning air horse whinnies softly smell freedom leather gathers wind grass warms wood irish leather gallops horizon ' memo co founder john molloy understandably proud rural irish upbringing irish leather first memo's cuirs nomades series positively sings ireland's rustic beauty opening notes juniper pink pepper clary sage whisk us away wild countryside leather sharp well worn deeply animalic gives us barn saddle horse comforting yet forlorn stark yet vibrantly beautiful irish leather among wonderfully wearable leathers we've ever experienced,"pink pepper, clary sage, juniper berry, green mate absolute, flouve, iris concrete, tonka bean absolute, leather, birch, amber accord"
Italian Leather Eau de Parfum,MEMO,"The smell of leather can represent so much in Italian culture, from a couture jacket to ancient Roman armor. But for the Italian edition of their Cuirs Nomades series, MEMO and Alienor Massenet chose the ultimate depiction of the quintessentially Italian la bella vita- the leather-wrapped steering wheel of a top-down cabriolet hugging the curves on a coastal highway, young lovers tucked into the seats, hair whipping in the countryside-scented wind, a sumptuous picnic packed into a basket in the backseat. The first impressions of Italian Leather are fresh and green: tomato leaf and soft, lightly herbal vanilla, accompanied by a sharp, young leather that invigorates. As the leather matures and mixes with orris root and resinous galbanum, the warm, spicy outdoorsy qualities give off a hint of motor oil and coastal air, leaving us relaxed and excited all at once. Italians, as they say, are the French in a good mood- and one sniff of Italian Leather is bound to put you in a good mood all your own.","green tomato leaf, vanilla, leather, rockrose absolute, galbanum, clary sage, iris concrete, vanilla bean, sandalwood, tolu balsam resin, opoponax resin, myrrh resin, benzoin resin, leather accord, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/69109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,smell leather represent much italian culture couture jacket ancient roman armor italian edition cuirs nomades series memo alienor massenet chose ultimate depiction quintessentially italian la bella vita leather wrapped steering wheel top cabriolet hugging curves coastal highway young lovers tucked seats hair whipping countryside scented wind sumptuous picnic packed basket backseat first impressions italian leather fresh green tomato leaf soft lightly herbal vanilla accompanied sharp young leather invigorates leather matures mixes orris root resinous galbanum warm spicy outdoorsy qualities give hint motor oil coastal air leaving us relaxed excited italians say french good mood one sniff italian leather bound put good mood,"green tomato leaf, vanilla, leather, rockrose absolute, galbanum, clary sage, iris concrete, vanilla bean, sandalwood, tolu balsam resin, opoponax resin, myrrh resin, benzoin resin, leather accord, musk"

Pomelo Paradis Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne,"The Pomelo may look like a jumbo-sized grapefruit, but don't mistake the two. They're actually distant cousins that share very little in common. Beneath the pomelo's bitter, bright green peel lies a pink fruit with the sweetness of an orange. Though pomelos have been loved in Southeast Asia for ages, they've only recently gained popularity in western groceries.
Pomelo Paradis is Atelier Cologne's 7th cologne absolue in their Collection Originale, and is an homage to this unsung citrus. With one of the most mouthwatering openings we've ever smelled, Pomelo Paradis serves up both the crisp edginess of the peel with all the sweetness of its fruit; like the moment of pulling apart the juicy segments, with the peel just removed, not yet discarded.
Pomelo Paradis sustains its crisp, sweet freshness by surrounding Floridian pink pomelo with heart notes of the highest quality - tangy black currant bud, sweet Calabrian mandarin, Moroccan orange blossom, Bulgarian rose and Chinese mint.

Debaser Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Blaring Pixies music on a hot day - that's the inspiration for D.S. and Duga's woody fig scent, Debaser. For anyone who has heard Pixies' front man Black Francis' wail, the thought of a fig scent may seem an odd choice. But Debaser, named after the band's 1989 hit, is not a typically creamy, lactic or fruity fig. It's a bright, hot green scent that opens with a waft of fig tree broiling in the August sun. It's an energetic, warm, bold and woody fig.
Debaser's refrain, ""I am un chien andalusia,"" is a nod to the title of Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's classic surrealist film. Black Francis said of Bunuel, ""I wish Bunuel were still alive. He made this film about nothing in particular. The title itself is a nonsense."" D.S. and Durga's Debaser is therefor a tribute to a song about a film about ""nothing in particular."" And fittingly, it's a fragrance that becomes even more compelling in its drydown, when it sheds the specificity of its figgy verisimilitude. That's when a perfect blend of base notes - iris, coconut, tonka and moss - leave a cool, velvet-soft hint of wood on skin.

Freetrapper Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"D.S. & Durga's Freetrapper distills a rugged landscape of rivers and tangled trees through sharp citrus and a sweet, warm shadow of cedar. It evokes the free-spirited trappers, traders, and mountain men who roamed the Rockies, living with the elements when trading in beaver pelts was necessary business, when the beaver (castor canendensis) was hunted for its fur and valuable musk. Freetrapper's heart notes of light, smoky incense encircles the bracing green citrus; like smoke on the horizon with the crush of faded greens underfoot on a trapper's weary trek homeward. It's the crisp yet animalic scent of wild dangerous times - of loners, lawbreakers, vagabond merchants crisscrossing dense, aromatic and desolate wilds to make money, settle land, love local women and die with their beaver boots on.","distilled incense, bergamot, bitter orange, dark cedar, snakeroot, osmanthus, amberwood, santal, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68601.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,durga's freetrapper distills rugged landscape rivers tangled trees sharp citrus sweet warm shadow cedar evokes free spirited trappers traders mountain men roamed rockies living elements trading beaver pelts necessary business beaver castor canendensis hunted fur valuable musk freetrapper's heart notes light smoky incense encircles bracing green citrus like smoke horizon crush faded greens underfoot trapper's weary trek homeward crisp yet animalic scent wild dangerous times loners lawbreakers vagabond merchants crisscrossing dense aromatic desolate wilds make money settle land love local women die beaver boots,"distilled incense, bergamot, bitter orange, dark cedar, snakeroot, osmanthus, amberwood, santal, castoreum"
Burning Barbershop Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"In 1891, Westlake NY, a bottle of blackened cologne survived a conflagration that burned the Curling Bros. barbershop to the ground. Charred, reduced and dark, this scorched blend of vintage gentlemanly notes has been vividly re-created by David Moltz in all its pungent, roasted glory. The resonance and reach of Burning Barbershop is quite magnificent; a sweet rubbed spearmint note mixed with offbeat salted lime creates wonderful fumes of nostalgia. Everything smells baked and piquant. Lavender is a beautiful rich addition, smoky, hot and sugared, crumbled across the embers of the cologne's base notes. It is scent for flesh, not for paper and abstract wanderings. You might miss the most amazing soft-shoed vanilla as it dances softy in the smoke, tempering the excesses of bitter citrus and metallic pyrotechnics. A black, rubber whiff of night pervades the drydown, as if the skin is releasing soot into a starless sky. A scent of darkened wonderment.","spearmint, lime, hemlock spruce, lavender absolute, rose, burnt oil, vanilla, hay",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68603.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,westlake ny bottle blackened cologne survived conflagration burned curling bros barbershop ground charred reduced dark scorched blend vintage gentlemanly notes vividly created david moltz pungent roasted glory resonance reach burning barbershop quite magnificent sweet rubbed spearmint note mixed offbeat salted lime creates wonderful fumes nostalgia everything smells baked piquant lavender beautiful rich addition smoky hot sugared crumbled across embers cologne's base notes scent flesh paper abstract wanderings might miss amazing soft shoed vanilla dances softy smoke tempering excesses bitter citrus metallic pyrotechnics black rubber whiff night pervades drydown skin releasing soot starless sky scent darkened wonderment,"spearmint, lime, hemlock spruce, lavender absolute, rose, burnt oil, vanilla, hay"
Bowmakers Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"If you can imagine a workshop, lit by oil lamps and a brace of flickering candles, wax dripping to the floor. Everywhere is wood, maple, mahogany, chips of darkest ebony, floor littered in fragrant curled shavings, the air filled with lacquered dust and the aromatics of a thousand sweet pencils. A man bends over an oak bench, tending to the curved form of a violin, the body warm and golden in the soft light, its neck, pegs and tailpiece scattered under his nimble fingers. Puffs of pine resin drift as he works, smoothing, gluing and attending to the preparation of varnishes and oils to give ornate lustre to grain and line. This is D.S & Durga's Bowmakers, an astonishing time capsule evocation of violin and bow making workshops in 18th century American pioneer towns. Each workshop concocted their own secret recipe for the decorative shellacs and lacquers. These might contain elemi, benzoin, saffron, mastic, sandalwood and turpentine for color, preservation, finish, tone and beauty. D.S.& Durga have brought this polished, resinous portrait of craftsmen to life in an affecting and vibrantly glowing scent.","violin varnish, mahogany, outdoors accord, amber pine resin, maplewood, cypress, spiced tree resin, cedar, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68604.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,imagine workshop lit oil lamps brace flickering candles wax dripping floor everywhere wood maple mahogany chips darkest ebony floor littered fragrant curled shavings air filled lacquered dust aromatics thousand sweet pencils man bends oak bench tending curved form violin body warm golden soft light neck pegs tailpiece scattered nimble fingers puffs pine resin drift works smoothing gluing attending preparation varnishes oils give ornate lustre grain line durga's bowmakers astonishing time capsule evocation violin bow making workshops th century american pioneer towns workshop concocted secret recipe decorative shellacs lacquers might contain elemi benzoin saffron mastic sandalwood turpentine color preservation finish tone beauty durga brought polished resinous portrait craftsmen life affecting vibrantly glowing scent,"violin varnish, mahogany, outdoors accord, amber pine resin, maplewood, cypress, spiced tree resin, cedar, moss"
Coriander Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Coriander is perhaps one of the most inscrutable and left-field aromas in the D.S. & Durga canon. It is sparklingly green, but also a dry peppery herbal, and at the same time a delicate aquatic floral musk. Coriander defies easy classification. But where is the fun is labeling anyway? It might be the subtle, unexpected salinity that makes this scent such an enigma, that sea breeze drifting through the formula, deftly weaving pepper, juniper, geranium, magnolia, musk and mace around the heart of Ukrainian coriander. As it unfolds on the skin it evokes a warm summer breeze off the Black Sea, rolling up the hills above Odessa. It's a light, fresh, energetic green.","russian coriander, pepper, juniper needle, geranium, clove stem, clary sage, musk, magnolia, mace",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,coriander perhaps one inscrutable left field aromas durga canon sparklingly green also dry peppery herbal time delicate aquatic floral musk coriander defies easy classification fun labeling anyway might subtle unexpected salinity makes scent enigma sea breeze drifting formula deftly weaving pepper juniper geranium magnolia musk mace around heart ukrainian coriander unfolds skin evokes warm summer breeze black sea rolling hills odessa light fresh energetic green,"russian coriander, pepper, juniper needle, geranium, clove stem, clary sage, musk, magnolia, mace"
Cowboy Grass Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Still as a silvered sunset on a dry summer's eve, Cowboy Grass crackles with quiet urgency across the skin. Parched and desolate, the sagebrush awaits the fire. The scent teeters on the edge of ignition, but seems somehow to hold back, soothed perhaps by a sense of latent moisture in the air, brushing through the flowering white thyme and prairie switchgrass. The rooty majesty of vetiver is one of perfumery's most vital and transcendent notes, the full flavor secreted away in the rhizome of Chrysopogon zizanioides which is harvested, hung and dried like precious game. Cowboy Grass is lit through with Haitian vetiver, known for its sweeter, smokier tones. The fragrance settles into a calming rhythmic aridity, vast and mysterious. We see the hands of Christina Olson in Wyeth's iconic 1948 painting planted firmly in the grass as she looks up at that distant haunting grey house. One of the most skeletal depictions of landscape in scent, Cowboy Grass is a quiet masterpiece, a poignant scent of hush and privacy.","rosewood, wild thyme, bergamot, sagebrush, basil, rose otto, vetiver, grass, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,still silvered sunset dry summer's eve cowboy grass crackles quiet urgency across skin parched desolate sagebrush awaits fire scent teeters edge ignition seems somehow hold back soothed perhaps sense latent moisture air brushing flowering white thyme prairie switchgrass rooty majesty vetiver one perfumery's vital transcendent notes full flavor secreted away rhizome chrysopogon zizanioides harvested hung dried like precious game cowboy grass lit haitian vetiver known sweeter smokier tones fragrance settles calming rhythmic aridity vast mysterious see hands christina olson wyeth's iconic painting planted firmly grass looks distant haunting grey house one skeletal depictions landscape scent cowboy grass quiet masterpiece poignant scent hush privacy,"rosewood, wild thyme, bergamot, sagebrush, basil, rose otto, vetiver, grass, ambergris"
Italian Citrus Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Any D.S. & Durga take on citrus notes will intrigue the senses and warm the blood. This is balmy sprawled afternoons under parasols, tugged gently by summer winds, books and neglected papers scattered softly in the temperate shade. The scent of citrus trees drifts by like a reminder of seasons lived and loved. There is so much depth to Italian Citrus, a balsamic, rounded fervor rare in this family of effervescent fleeting aromas. Designed traditionally to refresh and whet our olfactory edge, citrus scents use sparkle, zing and sherbet to widen our senses and awaken the torpid soul. This oddly powdered scent with its hints of sticky Campari and candied peel fuses traditional zest and peel with smoke and sweet animalics for an incredibly sophisticated patina of cocktail poise. Hours into the drydown Italian Citrus is an exercise in clean, tender classicism.","cold pressed lemon, chinotto, blood orange, green mandarin, violet leaf, incense, copaiba balsam, musk ambrette, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68607.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,durga take citrus notes intrigue senses warm blood balmy sprawled afternoons parasols tugged gently summer winds books neglected papers scattered softly temperate shade scent citrus trees drifts like reminder seasons lived loved much depth italian citrus balsamic rounded fervor rare family effervescent fleeting aromas designed traditionally refresh whet olfactory edge citrus scents use sparkle zing sherbet widen senses awaken torpid soul oddly powdered scent hints sticky campari candied peel fuses traditional zest peel smoke sweet animalics incredibly sophisticated patina cocktail poise hours drydown italian citrus exercise clean tender classicism,"cold pressed lemon, chinotto, blood orange, green mandarin, violet leaf, incense, copaiba balsam, musk ambrette, oakmoss"
Mississippi Medicine Eau de Parfum,D.S. and Durga,"Tribal pyres burning in the forests, with smoke from pine, holly, cypress, laurel, and cedar rising upwards to the gods. D.S.& Durga looked to the funerary rituals of the early Mississippian Death Cult, the loosely connected network of tribes in America's regions around the 1200 AD, as the inspirations for the haunting yet comfortingly earthy Mississippi Medicine.
Mississippi Medicine opens with herbal, woody top notes of freshly gathered juniper branches, twigs, lichen-clad bark, and sweet grassy violet - damp, cool, and dense with a stunning realism. Birch tar emerges like smoke mingling up through the wood and herbs of the pyre before it is consumed in flames. As the birch smoke floats above the skin in wafts of muted, spectral, gray in the scent's unfolding, the base of dry cedar and frankincense grows stronger. And in the final dry down all that remains is that incense and the woody embers, like the ash that was left after the pyres died down; after the smoke had reached the gods above and only the cinders remain to be covered and buried back into the soil.","red cedar, aldehydes, frankincense distillate, cypress root, black pine, cascarilla bark, incense, cade, birch tar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/68608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tribal pyres burning forests smoke pine holly cypress laurel cedar rising upwards gods durga looked funerary rituals early mississippian death cult loosely connected network tribes america's regions around ad inspirations haunting yet comfortingly earthy mississippi medicine mississippi medicine opens herbal woody top notes freshly gathered juniper branches twigs lichen clad bark sweet grassy violet damp cool dense stunning realism birch tar emerges like smoke mingling wood herbs pyre consumed flames birch smoke floats skin wafts muted spectral gray scent's unfolding base dry cedar frankincense grows stronger final dry remains incense woody embers like ash left pyres died smoke reached gods cinders remain covered buried back soil,"red cedar, aldehydes, frankincense distillate, cypress root, black pine, cascarilla bark, incense, cade, birch tar"
A La Rose Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"A la rose is a declaration of love for all women captured in a fragrance. Queen of flowers, the rose knows no boundaries and has inspired those in the creative arts for centuries. Poets, painters, musicians... and perfumers alike. All have sought to capture its aura, its magic and its secrets.
Two varieties of rose have bestowed the radiance and richness of their petals on this Eau de parfum: two hundred and fifty Centifolia roses from Grasse (May Rose) in the form of an absolute produce a very floral base note with sweet honeyed and carnal accents. One hundred and fifty Damascena roses from Bulgaria in the form of an essential oil create a top note with a playful blend of pear and lychee.

Vetiver Oriental Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"A Palais Royal exclusive, released for export for a limited time only, Vetiver Oriental is a completely unique interpretation of vetiver, as original as we came to expect from Lutens. Rich and striking, Vetiver Oriental enthralls us with its luxuriously balsamic accents of benzoin and labdanum. Moving from the brighter, more aromatic vetiver of the top notes, highlighted by the greens and the earthy chilliness of iris, the fragrance darkens considerably. The heart is a nocturnal, sultry brew of spicy gaiac wood and vetiver, a deep, exceptionally luxurious accord, which underscores the velvety depth of the vetiver by including a chocolate note. The union of the earthy, resinous notes and the dark, bitter chocolate is breathtakingly beautiful. Enriched further by the opulent base notes of soft musk, golden amber, sweet sandalwood and warm, silky-smooth labdanum, the scent wows us with its exceptional luxuriousness, its mysterious beauty and proves once and for all that where the woody oriental perfumes are concerned, Lutens has no equals.","sap, iris pallida, undergrowth notes, vetiver, gaiac wood, chocolate, musk, amber, mosses, sandalwood, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36110.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,palais royal exclusive released export limited time vetiver oriental completely unique interpretation vetiver original came expect lutens rich striking vetiver oriental enthralls us luxuriously balsamic accents benzoin labdanum moving brighter aromatic vetiver top notes highlighted greens earthy chilliness iris fragrance darkens considerably heart nocturnal sultry brew spicy gaiac wood vetiver deep exceptionally luxurious accord underscores velvety depth vetiver including chocolate note union earthy resinous notes dark bitter chocolate breathtakingly beautiful enriched opulent base notes soft musk golden amber sweet sandalwood warm silky smooth labdanum scent wows us exceptional luxuriousness mysterious beauty proves woody oriental perfumes concerned lutens equals,"sap, iris pallida, undergrowth notes, vetiver, gaiac wood, chocolate, musk, amber, mosses, sandalwood, labdanum"

As the most elegantly feminine of Penhaligon's new Trade Routes Collection, Empressa is a testament to the silks, baubles and delicacies then available to only a lucky few- those most exotic of imports that gave rise to the luxury goods we covet to this day. Empressa's opening shimmers with bright pink pepper, succulent blood orange, dewberry, and a juicy, mouthwatering peach note. The heart is richly floral, lustrous with the dusky pinks and soft whites of rose and neroli, evoking smooth silks and luminous jewels.

Erdenstern Eau de Parfum,April Aromatics,"It might not seem like a compliment to say that a fragrance reminds you of a rainy day, but in the case of Erdenstern, the latest all-natural stunner from April Aromatics, we mean it as high praise. Of course, we're not talking about some ordinary rainy day- Erdenstern is more like a warm, gentle rain in a mist-shrouded meadow, an earthy, musky meditation with an almost spiritual power to uplift and inspire reflection.
Erdenstern ('Earth Star') takes its inspiration from Avalon, the Arthurian holy place between the worlds of gods and mortals, so it's only natural that the fragrance is elevated and ethereal, linking wet, earthy vetiver to a heavenly, incense-tinged botanical musk accord that melds the sensual with the spiritual. A restrained touch of sweetness from opoponax and tobacco protect against solemnity, while an unprecedented botanical ambergris accord is stunning in its delicate complexity. Tanja Bochnig has long impressed us with her gift for creating fragrances that embrace their all-natural ingredients as an asset and an identity. But as good as each and every offering from April Aromatics has been, Erdenstern, with its deep well of gentle beauty and genuine wisdom, might be her best yet.","botanical musk accord, botanical ambergris accord, tonka bean, vetiver, tabak, cacao, opoponax",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65811.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,might seem like compliment say fragrance reminds rainy day case erdenstern latest natural stunner april aromatics mean high praise course we're talking ordinary rainy day erdenstern like warm gentle rain mist shrouded meadow earthy musky meditation almost spiritual power uplift inspire reflection erdenstern 'earth star' takes inspiration avalon arthurian holy place worlds gods mortals natural fragrance elevated ethereal linking wet earthy vetiver heavenly incense tinged botanical musk accord melds sensual spiritual restrained touch sweetness opoponax tobacco protect solemnity unprecedented botanical ambergris accord stunning delicate complexity tanja bochnig long impressed us gift creating fragrances embrace natural ingredients asset identity good every offering april aromatics erdenstern deep well gentle beauty genuine wisdom might best yet,"botanical musk accord, botanical ambergris accord, tonka bean, vetiver, tabak, cacao, opoponax"
Tagete Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"The scent of a courtyard garden in Amalfi is, of course, far more than just the garden itself. On Italy's postcard-perfect Mediterranean coast, the lush, dewy florals of a carefully cultivated garden blend seamlessly into the ambient fragrance of the terroir: the wild plants, the mossy trees, the ocean itself. Breathtakingly, authentically beautiful, Tagete is an opportunity to visit one of the most peaceful locales on the planet- no matter where you might be.
Tagete opens in a fresh, lovely burst of flowers, both wild and cultivated- rich, honey-sweet marigold, full-bodied jasmine, and the creamy, lively tuberose that Profumum perfected in their Tuberosa. A delicately earthy vetiver adds depth, while a damp, fresh moss bridges the gap between sea and earth. The overall effect is meditative, a stolen moment of reflection and appreciation.

Kashan Rose Eau de Toilette,The Different Company,"The Different Company's L'Esprit Cologne series has consistently reinvigorated an often narrowly defined category with fresh, light scents that still manage to showcase sophisticated ingredients with surprising sillage and longevity. Kashan Rose, the latest in the line, accomplishes this with distinction, delivering a bright, cheerful, lightly spicy rose of unexpected sophistication and depth that's as effortlessly attractive as it is easy to wear. Kashan Rose opens with a tingly sparkle of pink pepper, given fruity depth from litchi and an herbaceous hum of cardamom and sage. The rose that emerges, named for a Persian city famous for its annual Rose Festival, is fresh, green and uplifting, projecting a natural, full-bodied rose that never gets heavy or cloying. And despite the exquisite lightness of the rose note, it lingers for hours, supported by a sheer, musky base of ambrette and hawthorn.

Egypt, one of two stunning new fragrances rediscovered from Fouquet's private collection, is a testament to Fouquet's enduring legacy, a subtle, sophisticated and remarkably fresh woody eau de parfum inspired by (and conceived during) two sightseeing trips through one of the world's most fascinating, culturally rich countries. Based on the exotic plants and flowers Fouquet found in the gardens of his Egyptian friend during his visit, Egypt opens with a crisp, understated mixture of citrus, lavender and moss, calling to mind leisurely mornings in sunny courtyards with good company.

Cap d'Antibes Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob,"Sailing in the picturesque waters of the Grande Bleue, taking in a golden sunset from the gardens of the Eden Roc, enjoying a cocktail in the refined company of European aristocracy: summer on the French Riviera in the 1930s was the kind of glamorous existence that simply has no equal in contemporary society. For Albert Fouquet, it was the very pinnacle of life, one he was inspired to capture in a fragrance that might help chase away the doldrums of the cold Parisian winter. The resulting fragrance was Cap D'Antibes, an enveloping, sophisticated fougere that was exclusive to Fouquet's private collection- until now. Cap D'Antibes immediately whisks you to the sun-kissed cobblestones of the south of France with a bright, sparkling opening of sweet violet, cool mint, and lightly resinous birch.

Brazilian photographer Gustavo Pellizzon brings out the beauty of shadows; his image Ombre Indigo (a print is included in the box) is a tribute to grace. This serene, relaxed man seems to have waltzed with the sun. He carried on his shoulders the firepower of stars and now surrenders to the indigo wave that brings the gentleness of sunset.

Cuir Cuba Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Why name a fragrance Cuir Cuba Intense when a standard 'Cuir Cuba' doesn't even exist? One sniff of Patricia de Nicolai's stunningly complex new tobacco and leather scent should clear that question up. Rich, spicy, floral and animalic, Cuir Cuba Intense is such a gorgeously constructed head-turner that a more modest name would have felt like an understatement.
Inspired by Mme de Nicolai's early memories of the family humidor, Cuir Cuba Intense opens with a nostalgic burst of lemon, mint and licorice, brisk and herbaceous, which conjures the wonders and pleasures of childhood. As the centerpiece tobacco leaf accord unfolds, smooth and musky, it's embraced by a soft floral bouquet and gourmand spice notes of cumin and coriander. The dry down reveals further amber/leather warmth and smoothness, blending seamlessly with the heart notes until making way for a sexy, animalic hay-and-civet final phase. Vivid, complex and richly comforting, Cuir Cuba Intense is the kind of unique, compelling fragrance that words can't do justice- you'll have to experience it for yourself.","lemon, star anise, licorice, mint, lavender, geranium, ylang-ylang, magnolia, coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, tobacco, hay, liatris, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31351.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,name fragrance cuir cuba intense standard 'cuir cuba' even exist one sniff patricia de nicolai's stunningly complex new tobacco leather scent clear question rich spicy floral animalic cuir cuba intense gorgeously constructed head turner modest name would felt like understatement inspired mme de nicolai's early memories family humidor cuir cuba intense opens nostalgic burst lemon mint licorice brisk herbaceous conjures wonders pleasures childhood centerpiece tobacco leaf accord unfolds smooth musky embraced soft floral bouquet gourmand spice notes cumin coriander dry reveals amber/leather warmth smoothness blending seamlessly heart notes making way sexy animalic hay civet final phase vivid complex richly comforting cuir cuba intense kind unique compelling fragrance words can't justice experience,"lemon, star anise, licorice, mint, lavender, geranium, ylang-ylang, magnolia, coriander, cumin, patchouli, cedar, tobacco, hay, liatris, civet"
Land of Warriors Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince,"In the storybook world of The Vagabond Prince, our heroes are classic archetypes: noble monarchs, comely damsels, and, in the case of Land of Warriors, honorable yet ferocious adventurers clad head to toe in that most rugged of all materials- leather. In fact, Bertrand Duchaufour has stunned us yet again with his inventiveness, gifting Land of Warriors with a unique vertical blend of leather accords that emerge across every stage of the fragrance, paying tribute to multiple facets of this versatile, powerful material.
We follow the leather in Land of Warriors through its impressively distinct phases, beginning with top notes of vegetal leather: violet leaf, cucumber accord and blackcurrant open fresh, tart and green. Before long, we encounter leather again, now in a more spicy, mineral state: syrupy davana and cistus absolute serve as a backdrop for oakwood, saffron and nutmeg, forming central notes that project with a refined but undeniable strength. As the more animalic facets of leather emerge in the form of castoreum, strength shares space with sensuality. Finally, the battle won, the warrior relaxes by the evening campfire, where the final smoky leather effect of styrax and tar swirls into an intoxicating base.

Swan Princess Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince,"As the old European fairy tale goes, a princess was turned into a beautiful white swan so resplendent in her plumage that anyone who touched her feathers was compelled to follow her wherever she went. Built around a lavish cocoon of six beautifully distinct musks, Swan Princess proves itself worthy of its namesake, delivering an enchantingly soft musky-floral that instantly puts you under its spell. As if first seeing the titular Swan from a distance, your first impressions of Swan Princess are sheer whiteness- sparkling clean aldehydes and crisp, fresh citrus, with only the tiniest zing of pink pepper for contrast. As the softness of the indulgently muscenone-laden base begins to emerge, it gently twists around a lusciously floral heart, led by notes of iris, rose and jasmine. The result is extraordinary- fresh, utterly natural flowers that float seamlessly into one another, every possible rough edge polished smooth by the gorgeous musk blend. Breathtakingly soft, achingly beautiful- Swan Princess is pure magic.","pink pepper, aldehydes, fresh citrus accord, bergamot, jasmine, gardenia, lily of the valley, mimosa, iris, rose, peony, musk, sandalwood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,old european fairy tale goes princess turned beautiful white swan resplendent plumage anyone touched feathers compelled follow wherever went built around lavish cocoon six beautifully distinct musks swan princess proves worthy namesake delivering enchantingly soft musky floral instantly puts spell first seeing titular swan distance first impressions swan princess sheer whiteness sparkling clean aldehydes crisp fresh citrus tiniest zing pink pepper contrast softness indulgently muscenone laden base begins emerge gently twists around lusciously floral heart led notes iris rose jasmine result extraordinary fresh utterly natural flowers float seamlessly one another every possible rough edge polished smooth gorgeous musk blend breathtakingly soft achingly beautiful swan princess pure magic,"pink pepper, aldehydes, fresh citrus accord, bergamot, jasmine, gardenia, lily valley, mimosa, iris, rose, peony, musk, sandalwood, vetiver"
Violettes du Czar Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"Of the many honors bestowed upon the legendary perfumers of France, only Oriza L. Legrand was ever given the title ofâÂPurveyor to the Russian Court.' As the standout fragrance from the ensuing royal collection, Violettes du Czar caused a sensation across the Courts of Europe, thrilling the men and women noble enough to wear it with its audacious fortitude. Now, Oriza L. Legrand has brought back this classic fragrance, and we're delighted to report that this violet-and-leather stunner is every bit as head-turning as it must have been 100 years ago. Much of Violettes du Czars' distinctive character comes, unsurprisingly, from the violets- specifically, the distinguished violets found in the south of France. Violettes du Czar showcases these prized flowers in all of their complexity, opening with the energizing sharpness of green violet leaves and earthy wild violet flowers before the sophisticated, lightly woody sweetness of the prized violets of Nice takes center stage in the heart, supported by iris and heliotrope. A virile yet silk-smooth accord of Russian leather anchors the base, adding power without sacrificing an ounce of sophistication. The days of the czar may be long gone, but his royal fragrance is back and better than ever.","violet leaves, wild violet, violet, iris, heliotrope, tolu balm, leather, amber, gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65225.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,many honors bestowed upon legendary perfumers france oriza l legrand ever given title purveyor russian court ' standout fragrance ensuing royal collection violettes du czar caused sensation across courts europe thrilling men women noble enough wear audacious fortitude oriza l legrand brought back classic fragrance we're delighted report violet leather stunner every bit head turning must years ago much violettes du czars' distinctive character comes unsurprisingly violets specifically distinguished violets found south france violettes du czar showcases prized flowers complexity opening energizing sharpness green violet leaves earthy wild violet flowers sophisticated lightly woody sweetness prized violets nice takes center stage heart supported iris heliotrope virile yet silk smooth accord russian leather anchors base adding power without sacrificing ounce sophistication days czar may long gone royal fragrance back better ever,"violet leaves, wild violet, violet, iris, heliotrope, tolu balm, leather, amber, gaiac wood"
Heliotrope Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"In the last 100 or so years, the heliotrope has been selectively bred to maximize its striking purple color, often sadly at the expense of its powerful, distinctive scent. How fortunate, therefore, that Heliotrope Blanc, created in 1886, honors the history of the flower by keeping the gorgeous vanilla-and-almond characteristics of heliotrope front and center. As a result, Heliotrope Blanc isn't just a fresh, elegantly blended floral with light gourmand touches- like all Oriza L. Legrand masterpieces, it's also a trip back through history. An exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level of this beautiful scent, opening alongside crisp violet leaves and orange blossom. In the heart, almond and mimosa draw out the heliotrope's indulgent side, drawing out the gourmand aspects of the flower while a sparkling iris keeps everything light and sheer. As Heliotrope Blanc dries down, musk and powder elements radiate softly, projecting timeless elegance. Not every heliotrope flower may smell as wonderfully as they used to, but as long as Oriza L. Legrand is around, we're happy knowing we can still get a gorgeous dose of the past.","orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65227.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,last years heliotrope selectively bred maximize striking purple color often sadly expense powerful distinctive scent fortunate therefore heliotrope blanc created honors history flower keeping gorgeous vanilla almond characteristics heliotrope front center result heliotrope blanc fresh elegantly blended floral light gourmand touches like oriza l legrand masterpieces also trip back history exquisitely rich heliotrope permeates every level beautiful scent opening alongside crisp violet leaves orange blossom heart almond mimosa draw heliotrope's indulgent side drawing gourmand aspects flower sparkling iris keeps everything light sheer heliotrope blanc dries musk powder elements radiate softly projecting timeless elegance every heliotrope flower may smell wonderfully used long oriza l legrand around we're happy knowing still get gorgeous dose past,"orange blossom, heliotrope, violet leaves, almond, mimosa, iris, musk, rice powder, benzoin, tonka bean"
Myrrh Casati Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Inspired by Marchesa Casati, the legendary patron of the arts and muse of eccentricity, known for her extravagant dark fashion and lavish fetes replete with exotic animals, gilded servants, and an infectious waft of incense and mystery that surrounded her.
Myrrh Casati casts a sharp spell with its concentrated top notes of spicy Peruvian red berries and pink pepper. We are swept into the heart and star of the fragrance, dark myrrh enrapt in richly herbal bittersweet notes of licorice, cardamom and safron. Incense, sweet benzoin and heady patchouli rise and dip into exotic smoky guaiac wood and earthy cypriol oil.

03. Apr. 1968 Eau de Parfum,Rundholz Parfums,"The ethereal properties of incense have inspired ritual and spiritual fascination in disparate cultures across the globe since the early beginnings of civilization. From the austere resins of Roman Catholic incense to the tartness of Indian Ayurvedic blends, it's a material with endless facets but a single, deeply mystical, heart. This is the foundation upon which German designer Lenka Rundholz commissioned Rundholz 03. Apr. 1968, a fragrance intended not merely to capture a single aspect of incense, but to represent that most cherished substance in its totality. The result, delivered masterfully by Arturetto Landi, is stunning: an utterly unique blend of incenses at once wise and playful, sexy and welcoming, with an individuality of spirit that immediately announces the wearer as one who would prefer to set trends rather than follow them. A juicy lychee note provides unexpected fruitiness at the top, making a bold, fashionable statement, while a heart of heliotrope gives a softly savory complexity to the heart. The incense, meanwhile, is the undeniable star of the show- every facet of this magical substance, from dry to rich to sultry, weaves in and out from one another to create a scent that continues to delight as it lingers on the skin for hours. As Rundholz has said, the moment-to-moment unpredictability is precisely the point- this gorgeous fragrance will manage to surprise you long after you've fallen in love with it.","lychee, heliotrope, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/67800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ethereal properties incense inspired ritual spiritual fascination disparate cultures across globe since early beginnings civilization austere resins roman catholic incense tartness indian ayurvedic blends material endless facets single deeply mystical heart foundation upon german designer lenka rundholz commissioned rundholz apr fragrance intended merely capture single aspect incense represent cherished substance totality result delivered masterfully arturetto landi stunning utterly unique blend incenses wise playful sexy welcoming individuality spirit immediately announces wearer one would prefer set trends rather follow juicy lychee note provides unexpected fruitiness top making bold fashionable statement heart heliotrope gives softly savory complexity heart incense meanwhile undeniable star show every facet magical substance dry rich sultry weaves one another create scent continues delight lingers skin hours rundholz said moment moment unpredictability precisely point gorgeous fragrance manage surprise long fallen love,"lychee, heliotrope, incense"
Nuit Noire Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Dirty, dark and delicious, Mona di Orio's Nuit Noire is a throwback to perfumes worn by women who didn't work in offices, but rather used their scents to perfume fur, cigarettes... or other unmentionables.
Nuit Noire starts with a surprisingly raunchy opening that combines cardamom and ginger with orange flower in a way that brings out the not-so-innocent orange flower's ripe-dirty side. From the beginning, Nuit Noire announces this perfume's rating: R, with a nod to triple-X. Incense and cinnamon-clove spices combined with the carnal tuberose then dries down, â if you can take it! â to a barnyard-y animalic dirtiness from leather and musk, no doubt with some sandalwood lurking around in the background.
Although Mona di Orio's press materials asks us to imagine we're in 'The souks, gardens, and hams of old Tunis' (of course Nuit Noire's notes reference old Arabia), Nuit Noire's soul is decidedly Film Noir: erotic and dangerous.","orange flower, cardamom, ginger, orange guinee, olibanum, cinnamon, tuberose, sandalwood, clove, cedarwood, amber, leather, musk, tonka",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dirty dark delicious mona di orio's nuit noire throwback perfumes worn women work offices rather used scents perfume fur cigarettes unmentionables nuit noire starts surprisingly raunchy opening combines cardamom ginger orange flower way brings innocent orange flower's ripe dirty side beginning nuit noire announces perfume's rating r nod triple x incense cinnamon clove spices combined carnal tuberose dries take barnyard animalic dirtiness leather musk doubt sandalwood lurking around background although mona di orio's press materials asks us imagine we're 'the souks gardens hams old tunis' course nuit noire's notes reference old arabia nuit noire's soul decidedly film noir erotic dangerous,"orange flower, cardamom, ginger, orange guinee, olibanum, cinnamon, tuberose, sandalwood, clove, cedarwood, amber, leather, musk, tonka"
Lux Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Like a chiaroscuro painting that contrasts extreme light with dark shadows, Mona di Orio's Lux (Latin for light) plays with an olfactory palette of light and dark. Lux starts off with a sparkling, sweet, and citrusy burst of Sicilian lemon and a lemongrass note from the Litsea cubeba, a tree in the evergreen family that is found in parts of Asia. This bright sweetness is tempered by the bitter-green herb note petitgrain signaling that, in spite of its name, Lux has more than a one-track mind.
Darker tones of amber, benzoin, labdanum and vanilla add a creamy, heavier mood to Lux, while vetiver, cedar and sandalwood add texture and woods. While Lux's bright notes can still be felt in the drydown, an almost gourmand darkness takes over. To Lux's warmth and creaminess, di Orio adds another surprise as Lux takes on an unexpected dimension: an animalic drydown that lists musk in the notes, but that smells like civet to the nose.
Like a walk in the woods as the day's light dims and the animal mystery of the forest is released, Lux's transformation is an olfactory wonder to behold.","lemon, litsea cubeba, petitgrain, vetiver, cedarwood, sandalwood, musk, amber, benzoin, bourbon vanilla cistus labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51707.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like chiaroscuro painting contrasts extreme light dark shadows mona di orio's lux latin light plays olfactory palette light dark lux starts sparkling sweet citrusy burst sicilian lemon lemongrass note litsea cubeba tree evergreen family found parts asia bright sweetness tempered bitter green herb note petitgrain signaling spite name lux one track mind darker tones amber benzoin labdanum vanilla add creamy heavier mood lux vetiver cedar sandalwood add texture woods lux's bright notes still felt drydown almost gourmand darkness takes lux's warmth creaminess di orio adds another surprise lux takes unexpected dimension animalic drydown lists musk notes smells like civet nose like walk woods day's light dims animal mystery forest released lux's transformation olfactory wonder behold,"lemon, litsea cubeba, petitgrain, vetiver, cedarwood, sandalwood, musk, amber, benzoin, bourbon vanilla cistus labdanum"
Lys Noir Eau de Parfum,Isabey,"The original edition of Lys Noir made its debut in 1924, the height of the glamorous anees folles, where its mysterious elegance and chic art deco design elements made it an instant hit among the fearless, trendsetting women that came to define the era. Now, 90 years later, the house of Isabey is again on the rise, and to celebrate the onset of their 10th decade, Lys Noir has been resurrected and updated for the modern market. We are delighted to confirm that this seductive, opulent woody floral fragrance is as perfect for the sophisticated femme fatale of today as it would have been all those years ago.
As the name suggests, Lys Noir is built around the captivating, narcotic flower of the lily, which is accompanied at the opening with an invigoratingly spicy burst of black pepper. As the rest of the heady, deeply floral bouquet emerges- animalic tuberose, spicy narcissus- Lys Noir envelops us completely, drawing us further and further under its spell not with raw volume but with the sophistication and seductive appeal of its composition. A darkly attractive base of smooth patchouli, powerful ebony and milky sandalwood maintains a perfect harmony between beauty and complexity- just like the dynamic women for whom this fragrance is perfectly suited. An exquisite and stylish black lacquered act-deco bottle and elegant coffret true to the original specifications complete the timeless aesthetic, ensuring that Lys Noir is a gem ideally suited to every collection.","black pepper, lily, tuberose, heliotrope, narcissus, ebony, sandalwood, patchouli, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,original edition lys noir made debut height glamorous anees folles mysterious elegance chic art deco design elements made instant hit among fearless trendsetting women came define era years later house isabey rise celebrate onset th decade lys noir resurrected updated modern market delighted confirm seductive opulent woody floral fragrance perfect sophisticated femme fatale today would years ago name suggests lys noir built around captivating narcotic flower lily accompanied opening invigoratingly spicy burst black pepper rest heady deeply floral bouquet emerges animalic tuberose spicy narcissus lys noir envelops us completely drawing us spell raw volume sophistication seductive appeal composition darkly attractive base smooth patchouli powerful ebony milky sandalwood maintains perfect harmony beauty complexity like dynamic women fragrance perfectly suited exquisite stylish black lacquered act deco bottle elegant coffret true original specifications complete timeless aesthetic ensuring lys noir gem ideally suited every collection,"black pepper, lily, tuberose, heliotrope, narcissus, ebony, sandalwood, patchouli, musk"
Doe in the Snow Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"The beauty of Sarah McCartney's playful, inventive creations lies in the specificity by which they're often created- inspired as she is by unique people, stories and requests, her scents are often more than a little out there- but they're never boring. Doe in the Snow, created for a customer's wintertime wedding, had a seemingly conflicting mission statement- make a big, fruity, mossy '60s/'70s-style chypre, but make it 'cold.' The results are striking- 'citrus fruits, flowers and woods, stirred with an icicle.' There's plenty of brightness from the grapefruit, yuzu and cedrat, but the cool, mossy leather notes and the sparkle of the aldehydes give a crisp chilliness to the light that feels like the sun rising across a frozen lake. Do you love the profile of big, vintage fragrances, but are uncomfortable with the idea of your scent entering the room before you do? Doe in the Snow lets you have it both ways. Graceful, yet practical, it's the casually opulent scent you never realized you needed.","grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64612.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,beauty sarah mccartney's playful inventive creations lies specificity they're often created inspired unique people stories requests scents often little they're never boring doe snow created customer's wintertime wedding seemingly conflicting mission statement make big fruity mossy ' s/' style chypre make 'cold ' results striking 'citrus fruits flowers woods stirred icicle ' there's plenty brightness grapefruit yuzu cedrat cool mossy leather notes sparkle aldehydes give crisp chilliness light feels like sun rising across frozen lake love profile big vintage fragrances uncomfortable idea scent entering room doe snow lets ways graceful yet practical casually opulent scent never realized needed,"grapefruit, cedrat, yuzu, peach aldehyde, snow, cedarwood, rose, jasmine, oak, opoponax, oakmoss, leather, green tea absolute"
Tart's Knicker Drawer Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"One day in the lab we were filtering six different fragrances at once. I tweeted, 'I'm about to get in the E3 bus smelling like a tart's boudoir'. The replies came back, 'You should make it!' 'I'd like to smell that one' 'Can I buy some?' so the next day, I sat down and blended some versions of all six.'
It may have come to pass from an off-color joke, but as with most of Sarah McCartney's more spontaneous sources of inspiration, the end results more than justify the concept. Tart's Knicker Drawer, despite the name, is anything but overloaded- in fact, it presents the sophisticated, immaculately assembled feel of an elegant woman of the 1950s- fitted waist, hat, heels, perfect makeup, and full-bodied, expensive perfume. In other words, while there's plenty of notes (as one might suspect from such a blend-intensive fragrance!), the result is both cohesive and surprisingly easy to wear. Indeed, Tart's Knicker Drawer wears its tongue-in-cheek moniker as a badge of pride, reveling in the thick cloud of big, powdery florals and spices and musky, rich base notes with a seductive confidence. If you're the type of person who can tell someone that you're wearing a fragrance named Tart's Knicker Drawer, then you're also the type who can pull off something this big, beautiful and fun.","bergamot, orange, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, raspberry, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood, violet, tuberose, gaiacwood, amber, musk, vanilla, benzoin, tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64613.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one day lab filtering six different fragrances tweeted 'i'm get e bus smelling like tart's boudoir' replies came back 'you make ' 'i'd like smell one' 'can buy ' next day sat blended versions six ' may come pass color joke sarah mccartney's spontaneous sources inspiration end results justify concept tart's knicker drawer despite name anything overloaded fact presents sophisticated immaculately assembled feel elegant woman fitted waist hat heels perfect makeup full bodied expensive perfume words there's plenty notes one might suspect blend intensive fragrance result cohesive surprisingly easy wear indeed tart's knicker drawer wears tongue cheek moniker badge pride reveling thick cloud big powdery florals spices musky rich base notes seductive confidence type person tell someone wearing fragrance named tart's knicker drawer also type pull something big beautiful fun,"bergamot, orange, grapefruit, pink peppercorn, raspberry, rose, jasmine, sandalwood, cedarwood, violet, tuberose, gaiacwood, amber, musk, vanilla, benzoin, tobacco"
Red Hoba Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"A fragrance doesn't necessarily have to be a gourmand in order to make you smell good enough to eat. That was our first thought after trying Red Hoba, a rich, exquisitely spiced addition to Xerjoff's Shooting Stars collection that blends intensely smoky notes with growling animalic ones, and yet arrives at a result both thrilling and, yes, mouthwatering. Like a meal with a groundbreaking Michelin-starred chef, you may not understand how the flavors come together when you're reading the menu, but you certainly will once you try the results. Red Hoba opens with an almost-Christmas-y cinnamon and cardamom that dance on the skin and balance the floral and fruity nuances of a full-bodied bergamot. Warm orris, jasmine and patchouli swirl in harmony with gentle incense, but as the base emerges, a fiercely sexy mix of labdanum and castoreum mingle with a soft, comforting musk and a delicate gaiac wood. What category does Red Hoba fall into? One sniff, and we promise you won't care.","bergamot, cinnamon, cardamom, jasmine, orris, incense, patchouli, cashmeran, guaiac wood, labdanum, papyrus, musk castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51138.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance necessarily gourmand order make smell good enough eat first thought trying red hoba rich exquisitely spiced addition xerjoff's shooting stars collection blends intensely smoky notes growling animalic ones yet arrives result thrilling yes mouthwatering like meal groundbreaking michelin starred chef may understand flavors come together reading menu certainly try results red hoba opens almost christmas cinnamon cardamom dance skin balance floral fruity nuances full bodied bergamot warm orris jasmine patchouli swirl harmony gentle incense base emerges fiercely sexy mix labdanum castoreum mingle soft comforting musk delicate gaiac wood category red hoba fall one sniff promise care,"bergamot, cinnamon, cardamom, jasmine, orris, incense, patchouli, cashmeran, guaiac wood, labdanum, papyrus, musk castoreum"
Blue Hope Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"Conventional wisdom says that cool fragrances can't be passionate and gourmands must be sickly sweet. We're glad nobody told Xerjoff that, because Blue Hope, the newest Shooting Star, is a tantalizingly complex stunner that combines fresh citrus and delicate spices with a delectably sexy vanilla-based drydown. Blue Hope announces its year-round wearability with an opening blast of bright citrus, immediately given intriguing depth with a heart featuring rich, warm cedar and savory saffron. As the smooth, creamy vanilla of the base blends with the spices to create a mouthwatering melange, an equally captivating castoreum/musk blend also asserts itself, balancing the delectable with the aphrodisiac. Finally, a fragrance guaranteed to make you smell delicious- in every way.","bergamot, mandarin orange, saffron, cedar, jasmine, vanilla, castoreum musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51139.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,conventional wisdom says cool fragrances can't passionate gourmands must sickly sweet we're glad nobody told xerjoff blue hope newest shooting star tantalizingly complex stunner combines fresh citrus delicate spices delectably sexy vanilla based drydown blue hope announces year round wearability opening blast bright citrus immediately given intriguing depth heart featuring rich warm cedar savory saffron smooth creamy vanilla base blends spices create mouthwatering melange equally captivating castoreum/musk blend also asserts balancing delectable aphrodisiac finally fragrance guaranteed make smell delicious every way,"bergamot, mandarin orange, saffron, cedar, jasmine, vanilla, castoreum musk"
Hedonist Rose Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya,"Viktoria Minya possesses an undeniable talent for flirty, gorgeous florals. Her Hedonist Rose is a take of light airiness - a bouquet of fresh roses with a crisp white wine accord, like a chilled Sancerre with a hint of peach. Top notes of lemon and peach give way to a sultry base of clove, amber, musk and vanilla.
Hedonist Rose is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine golden liquid.

Hedonist Iris Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya,"Viktoria Minya's Hedonist Iris is a perfect balance of the chic and the sensual. An elegant iris heart is warmed with cocoa, blackcurrant, labdanum, and musk. The effect is a graceful drydown, as the cool cloud of the iris petals settle into the warmth of labdanum and cocoa. Creamy, comforting and addictive (like an expensive French-milled soap), this is a must try for any iris lover.
Iris being the most expensive raw material of all, I knew I did not need to search further when searching for inspiration for the new Hedonists. I concentrated on the flower's delicate scent instead of the root, which is what most perfumers do. Hence the scent is powdery but much more refined, and it reflects better the majesty of Iris. Timeless elegance is what I felt being expressed whenever I worked on each trial, and often times I get feedback that it just smells like The Woman. The indulging note here is cocoa, but I didn't want it to be overwhelming, so it stays delicately in the background. Labdanum gives a certain depth to the fragrance, which I found particularly interesting, while the composition stays sheer and chic."" â Viktoria Minya Hedonist Iris is presented within a beautifully crafted bottle filled with hundreds of genuine bohemian crystals that sparkle brilliantly in the divine liquid and the bottle itself is enclosed within a handmade wooden box fashioned to capture the sleek look and feel of snakeskin leather.

Eau de Hongrie Eau de Parfum,Viktoria Minya,"Viktoria Minya's Eau de Hongrie is the revisite version of the famous Eau de la Reine de Hongrie (Water of the Queen of Hungary). The original Eau de la Reine de Hongrie was the first modern perfume referenced ever. According to the legend, the perfume was a gift from an angel and gave back youth and beauty to the aging Elisabeth in the 14th century, hence the Polish king fell in love and married her. In the 1300's the juice smelled pretty much smelled like rosemary tincture, so Minya decided to come up with a modern context of the famous scent. Today Hungary's famous Tokaji Asze ( Tokaji Essence ) represents a world wide appreciated dessert wine with proven medical benefits, this is why Eau de Hongrie evokes the honeyed aroma of this precious wine specialty.
Lovers of gourmands and Tokaji Aszu alike will delight in the floating honey notes of Eau de Hongrie. It is truly a bewitching elixir, capable of making one drunk just upon smelling. Glittering citrus notes shape the opening of the scent, followed by smooth balsamic labdanum and immortelle. A soft buzz of clove and a grounding sandalwood base finish it off, and all the time there is the glow of honey - warm and heavenly, as if it were dropped from the hands of an angel.
It is represented in a unique wine-shaped bottle with the black textured wooden box.","lemon, grapefruit, clove, jasmine, honey, sandalwood, immortelle, labdanum, musk, tonka bean, tokaji aszu wine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/62403.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,viktoria minya's eau de hongrie revisite version famous eau de la reine de hongrie water queen hungary original eau de la reine de hongrie first modern perfume referenced ever according legend perfume gift angel gave back youth beauty aging elisabeth th century hence polish king fell love married 's juice smelled pretty much smelled like rosemary tincture minya decided come modern context famous scent today hungary's famous tokaji asze tokaji essence represents world wide appreciated dessert wine proven medical benefits eau de hongrie evokes honeyed aroma precious wine specialty lovers gourmands tokaji aszu alike delight floating honey notes eau de hongrie truly bewitching elixir capable making one drunk upon smelling glittering citrus notes shape opening scent followed smooth balsamic labdanum immortelle soft buzz clove grounding sandalwood base finish time glow honey warm heavenly dropped hands angel represented unique wine shaped bottle black textured wooden box,"lemon, grapefruit, clove, jasmine, honey, sandalwood, immortelle, labdanum, musk, tonka bean, tokaji aszu wine"

Musc Tonkin Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"A powerful, addictive, erotic aura...The scent of heated flesh, solar, feline, subtly leathery. This elixir reinvents in a novel, contemporary style, the most suave note in perfumery, worshiped for millennia: Tonkin musk. More than a fragrance: an imprint.
The Chinese have prized it since Antiquity for its aphrodisiac virtues. Its smell was considered so heavenly by Islam it was blended into the mortar of some mosques so that they would exhale it in the sun. It was so penetrating that ships loaded with tea would refuse to carry it for fear it would impregnate their cargo...Tonkin musk, produced by a species of Himalayan deer, was one of the most precious ingredients of the perfumers' palette: it suffused their blends with a sensual aura that fixed and magnified every other essence.
No longer used for ethical reasons, natural musk still haunts perfumers since it has never been perfectly replaced. It is to capture this fascinating ghost that Musc Tonkin reinvents it by blending the most opulent raw materials to conjure its myriad facets. Their names don't matter: like the mysterious charisma of certain people who draw us into their wake, Musc Tonkin should be experienced rather than described.
Vibrant, faceted, surprising, at once nocturnal and solar, this aphrodisiac potion changes on each skin, the better to enhance it. A lick of salt for the taste of skin. A heady floral whiff to remind us that perfume links our bodies to the erotic spells of nature. A mulled-fruit burn contrasting with a light, shimmering veil of powder...unctuous as honey, melting and waxy as the finest leather, the scent conjures living flesh heated by pleasure but also its mossy ink-black depths.","stone absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35716.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,powerful addictive erotic aura scent heated flesh solar feline subtly leathery elixir reinvents novel contemporary style suave note perfumery worshiped millennia tonkin musk fragrance imprint chinese prized since antiquity aphrodisiac virtues smell considered heavenly islam blended mortar mosques would exhale sun penetrating ships loaded tea would refuse carry fear would impregnate cargo tonkin musk produced species himalayan deer one precious ingredients perfumers' palette suffused blends sensual aura fixed magnified every essence longer used ethical reasons natural musk still haunts perfumers since never perfectly replaced capture fascinating ghost musc tonkin reinvents blending opulent raw materials conjure myriad facets names matter like mysterious charisma certain people draw us wake musc tonkin experienced rather described vibrant faceted surprising nocturnal solar aphrodisiac potion changes skin better enhance lick salt taste skin heady floral whiff remind us perfume links bodies erotic spells nature mulled fruit burn contrasting light shimmering veil powder unctuous honey melting waxy finest leather scent conjures living flesh heated pleasure also mossy ink black depths,"stone absolute, musk"

Patchouli Absolu Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Patchouli Absolu is Tom Ford's personal ode to an ingredient that is intertwined with his own story. The iconic olfactive note of the 1970s, it evokes louche sensuality and after-dark glamour, as well as the heady blending of masculine and feminine that defined the era. This Eastern oil perfumed the skin of late seventies' glitterati and bohemians alike, pervading the air of jet-set parties with a provocative, dark glamour. Patchouli fragranced the world that was to shape Tom Ford's singular vision of style.
Today, Tom Ford reinvents this influential ingredient into a truly vanguard scent for a new era. Patchouli Absolu merges three opulent â and distinctly different â versions of this iconic plant ingredient. Patchouli oil contributes raw and primal texture; patchouli coeur, the ultra-luxurious, absolute extract of the plant, contributes an elusive and refined earthiness, and a breakthrough iteration of patchouli called Clearwood, used for the very first time in perfumery, is the most exquisite and pure rendition of patchouli's darkly addictive signature ever captured. The merging of these three facets creates the uniquely unconventional heart of the fragrance. They create a prism effect, reflecting off each other to intensify the depth and intrigue that is inherent to patchouli. Patchouli Absolu has a hypnotic signature that pulses with dark mystery.
Patchouli Absolu opens with wave upon wave of refined patchouli that coats your skin like dark brown velvet glittering with gold. Spicy sweetness fuses with multi-faceted woods and smokiness to create a lush, deeply sensual mix with enormous warmth. Tom Ford goes beyond the dusty earthiness and blackened camphor of many traditional patchouli fragrances, opting instead for subtle hints of green mosses and a wisp of fresh herbs, all wrapped up with dark woods and golden amber. In the drydown, the spicy, smoky woods turn creamy and soft with a touch of leather that feels like suede. The end result is not only plush, bold, and elegant from start to finish, but a far cry from the dirty, raw scent of the patchouli oils from the 1970s. In short, this is a patchouli fragrance for the 21st century, darkly sensual, luxurious, and sophisticated.","bay leaf, rosemary, moss, patchouli oil, patchouli coeur, patchouli clearwood, guaic wood, cypriol, violetwood, cashmere woods, tonka bean, amber, musk, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63536.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,patchouli absolu tom ford's personal ode ingredient intertwined story iconic olfactive note evokes louche sensuality dark glamour well heady blending masculine feminine defined era eastern oil perfumed skin late seventies' glitterati bohemians alike pervading air jet set parties provocative dark glamour patchouli fragranced world shape tom ford's singular vision style today tom ford reinvents influential ingredient truly vanguard scent new era patchouli absolu merges three opulent distinctly different versions iconic plant ingredient patchouli oil contributes raw primal texture patchouli coeur ultra luxurious absolute extract plant contributes elusive refined earthiness breakthrough iteration patchouli called clearwood used first time perfumery exquisite pure rendition patchouli's darkly addictive signature ever captured merging three facets creates uniquely unconventional heart fragrance create prism effect reflecting intensify depth intrigue inherent patchouli patchouli absolu hypnotic signature pulses dark mystery patchouli absolu opens wave upon wave refined patchouli coats skin like dark brown velvet glittering gold spicy sweetness fuses multi faceted woods smokiness create lush deeply sensual mix enormous warmth tom ford goes beyond dusty earthiness blackened camphor many traditional patchouli fragrances opting instead subtle hints green mosses wisp fresh herbs wrapped dark woods golden amber drydown spicy smoky woods turn creamy soft touch leather feels like suede end result plush bold elegant start finish far cry dirty raw scent patchouli oils short patchouli fragrance st century darkly sensual luxurious sophisticated,"bay leaf, rosemary, moss, patchouli oil, patchouli coeur, patchouli clearwood, guaic wood, cypriol, violetwood, cashmere woods, tonka bean, amber, musk, leather"

And that unmistakably dry and smoky aftertaste given by the caravanserai campfires, meant to keep the precious tea cargo dry in the never-ending journey through Siberia. The fresh mint leaves give a pleasant fresh touch to the hot water. A teaspoon of raspberry preserve sweetens, without altering it, the bitter aftertaste of leather and birch. We sip it slowly, gazing out of the wide window, towards the beautiful cathedral of Our Lady of Kazan and beyond. The Russian Tea Ritual today carried us to an unexpected journey in remote lands, full of mystery and fascination.
'Russian Tea is a journey, a day spent in Russia with a boiling Samovar, reigning in the house as the center of socialization and sharing. The black tea smell is strong, diffusing all around the house. It also evokes the journey of the tea through Siberia, taking the smell of campfires, and transportation in harsh conditions, interpreted by woody and leathery notes. The fresh mint leaves blend incredibly well with the smokiness, and the hint of raspberry and cinnamon that sweeten the bitterness of the tea.' â Julien Rasquinet, perfumer","mint, black pepper, raspberry, black tea, magnolia, everlasting flower, leather accord, incense, birchwood, cistus-labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64004.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,snow covered nevsky prospekt sumptuous art noveau building inside large bookstore first floor elegant cafe water poured cup infusion unleashes characteristic notes black tea heavy intense floral note sharp biting unmistakably dry smoky aftertaste given caravanserai campfires meant keep precious tea cargo dry never ending journey siberia fresh mint leaves give pleasant fresh touch hot water teaspoon raspberry preserve sweetens without altering bitter aftertaste leather birch sip slowly gazing wide window towards beautiful cathedral lady kazan beyond russian tea ritual today carried us unexpected journey remote lands full mystery fascination 'russian tea journey day spent russia boiling samovar reigning house center socialization sharing black tea smell strong diffusing around house also evokes journey tea siberia taking smell campfires transportation harsh conditions interpreted woody leathery notes fresh mint leaves blend incredibly well smokiness hint raspberry cinnamon sweeten bitterness tea ' julien rasquinet perfumer,"mint, black pepper, raspberry, black tea, magnolia, everlasting flower, leather accord, incense, birchwood, cistus-labdanum"

Blamage Parfum Extrait,Nasomatto,"""This fragrance is an unwise and unfortunate creation caused by bad judgement and care."" The Nose.
In the hands of any other creator, this statement might be an apology. For Alessandro Gualtieri, on the other hand, it's a mission statement: Blamage (""disgrace"" in German) may be a testament to mistakes and failures, but the result is as vibrantly intoxicating as each of its predecessors in the now-complete Nasomatto line. Inspired by legends of classic fragrances that achieved their unique character through mistakes in the design process, Gualtieri blindfolded himself, choosing four key (and undisclosed) ingredients at random. The perfume was painstakingly constructed from there, a process (portrayed in the upcoming documentary film ""The Nose- Searching For Blamage"") that took Gualtieri around the world and, supposedly, almost to the breaking point. In the end, however, this final fragrance from the much-beloved brand shines as brightly as the rest. Bright, citrusy/woodsy spice delivers an opening reminiscent of previous Nasomatto scents- but do we detect some fruit this time around? And, concept aside, don't worry about an apologetic sillage- as you might expect from the creator of Black Afgano, Blamage has huge projection and lasts for days. Powerful, intoxicating, and more than a little addictive, Blamage is the best possible kind of mistake- and it might just cause you to make a few mistakes you won't regret either.","white woods, leather, birch, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41010.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance unwise unfortunate creation caused bad judgement care nose hands creator statement might apology alessandro gualtieri hand mission statement blamage disgrace german may testament mistakes failures result vibrantly intoxicating predecessors complete nasomatto line inspired legends classic fragrances achieved unique character mistakes design process gualtieri blindfolded choosing four key undisclosed ingredients random perfume painstakingly constructed process portrayed upcoming documentary film nose searching blamage took gualtieri around world supposedly almost breaking point end however final fragrance much beloved brand shines brightly rest bright citrusy/woodsy spice delivers opening reminiscent previous nasomatto scents detect fruit time around concept aside worry apologetic sillage might expect creator black afgano blamage huge projection lasts days powerful intoxicating little addictive blamage best possible kind mistake might cause make mistakes regret either,"white woods, leather, birch, musk"
Intoxicated Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"No coffee tastes as good as it smells: but this sublime fragrance tantalizes the senses. Addicts crave a substance either as a prop against the harshness of life or to enhance its pleasures.
INTOXICATED is emphatically the latter.
Kilian Hennessy and Calice Becker conjure up the steam from an eggshell cup of rich viscous Turkish coffee laced with green cardamom in double strength - in oil and absolute - to glow as the opulent heart of the scent.

L'Art de la Guerre Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"There is an olfactive family, a perfume territory, which is traditionally emblematic of men; the Fern. This same fern that awakens in us the memory of the one who gave us our first romantic thrill, sometimes by stealing the fragrance of one of his elders.
A woman wearing fern can do it in memory of past conquests or in nostalgia for the comfort of her father's arms. But she can also just do it to defy people around her with alluring and provocative scents. A man wears it for the same reasons, sometimes nostalgic, others conqueror, manly, confident.
Francois Henin, Jovoy's owner and founder, needed a fresh, visionary and talented eye to address the delicate issue of revisiting such a classic universe. It was Vanina Murraciole, and the fragrance in development would soon be known as L'Art de la Guerre (The Art of War).
""The first test made me smile. I knew that the first fresh and incisive rhubarb note was what this fragrance needed to stand out among its nine siblings. Then, the genius of a 'clean' note, a handsome man who shaves himself, takes care of himself, perfumes himself. And at last, the long-awaited fern, slightly tinted by smoked immortal flowers, but woody and spicy.... I was at the time caught in a series of trips and found myself emptying the testers one after the other. I knew that other Noses were working on this bouquet, but I had made my decision, Vanina was right."" â Francois Henin","bergamot, rhubarb, lavender maillette, immortelle, nutmeg, violet leaf, patchouli, sandalwood , leather, oak moss, cistus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61610.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,olfactive family perfume territory traditionally emblematic men fern fern awakens us memory one gave us first romantic thrill sometimes stealing fragrance one elders woman wearing fern memory past conquests nostalgia comfort father's arms also defy people around alluring provocative scents man wears reasons sometimes nostalgic others conqueror manly confident francois henin jovoy's owner founder needed fresh visionary talented eye address delicate issue revisiting classic universe vanina murraciole fragrance development would soon known l'art de la guerre art war first test made smile knew first fresh incisive rhubarb note fragrance needed stand among nine siblings genius 'clean' note handsome man shaves takes care perfumes last long awaited fern slightly tinted smoked immortal flowers woody spicy time caught series trips found emptying testers one knew noses working bouquet made decision vanina right francois henin,"bergamot, rhubarb, lavender maillette, immortelle, nutmeg, violet leaf, patchouli, sandalwood , leather, oak moss, cistus"
Wode Eau de Parfum,Boudicca,"Wode opens with spices and green â coriander, cardamom, clary sage and juniper berries. There is clean earth and a hint of flowers and ocean and it all seems quite brisk and pleasant, until the opium accord kicks in, bitter and unsettling and hopelessly attractive. A stroll in the woods becomes a trek through a primeval forest with a few glowing yellow eyes peering at you from the shadows. A dark and ethereal swirl of resins and animalic notes dances around a heart of amber, leather and musk-- and there is an intriguing undercurrent of something raw and untamed, softened by a soft whisper of sweetly narcotic tuberose. The overall impression is not heavy â but airy and elemental, like the landscape after a fierce and cleansing storm. Iconoclast perfumer Geza Schoen (of Escentric Molecules fame) has taken his inspiration from the scent of raw opium. It reminds us of wet stone, and the way rain unlocks mysterious scents from the earth. Imagine dancing around Stonehenge while thunder rolls through the sky. The inspiration is ancient, but the scent itself is very modernâÂunusual, intriguing, and subtle enough to make it easy to wear, for both men and women. Appropriately addictive.","juniper, cardamon, pink pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, coriander seed, jasmin, rose, tuberose, angelica root, opium accord, saffron, tonka bean, styrax, amber, treemoss, musk, leather, sandalwood, blonde tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,wode opens spices green coriander cardamom clary sage juniper berries clean earth hint flowers ocean seems quite brisk pleasant opium accord kicks bitter unsettling hopelessly attractive stroll woods becomes trek primeval forest glowing yellow eyes peering shadows dark ethereal swirl resins animalic notes dances around heart amber leather musk intriguing undercurrent something raw untamed softened soft whisper sweetly narcotic tuberose overall impression heavy airy elemental like landscape fierce cleansing storm iconoclast perfumer geza schoen escentric molecules fame taken inspiration scent raw opium reminds us wet stone way rain unlocks mysterious scents earth imagine dancing around stonehenge thunder rolls sky inspiration ancient scent modern unusual intriguing subtle enough make easy wear men women appropriately addictive,"juniper, cardamon, pink pepper, black pepper, nutmeg, clary sage, coriander seed, jasmin, rose, tuberose, angelica root, opium accord, saffron, tonka bean, styrax, amber, treemoss, musk, leather, sandalwood, blonde tobacco"
L'Orpheline Eau de Parfum - ...,Serge Lutens,"Serge Lutens wants to explore the mysterious places between the moon and the earth through contrasting elements of black, white, silver, and plush cream. His new L'orpheline begins with the night sky, pitch black from smoky incense, then pierced by the silver light of the moon's sparkling aldehydes. Billowing clouds of myrrh add to the impression of crystal clear brightness, but they are also cool in the style of an Avignon incense fragrance. The incense and aldehydes swirl, dance, and weave their way down to earth where they settle on a pillow of cashmere woods and delicately spiced warmth. Very quickly, L'orpheline transforms itself into the most addictive blend of smoky, woody cream. Clean musk, amber, and a hint of spices dust the soft woods, but the fleecy softness outweighs them all. In its drydown, L'orpheline is like an angora blanket that hugs your skin with comforting, delicate coziness, giving you a gentle caress of meditative incense and pillow-soft creaminess. L'orpheline's transformation is complete. L'orpheline is an Haute Concentration eau de parfum, but its elegant softness make it one of Uncle Serge's more versatile creations. While it could easily be worn to work, we love to snuggle up to it after a long day at work. Its very serene drydown is a wonderful antidote to stress, or maybe we just really love creamy cashmere with incense.","aldehydes, cedar wood, fougere accord, coumarin, clouds ambergris, patchouli, incense, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36146.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,serge lutens wants explore mysterious places moon earth contrasting elements black white silver plush cream new l'orpheline begins night sky pitch black smoky incense pierced silver light moon's sparkling aldehydes billowing clouds myrrh add impression crystal clear brightness also cool style avignon incense fragrance incense aldehydes swirl dance weave way earth settle pillow cashmere woods delicately spiced warmth quickly l'orpheline transforms addictive blend smoky woody cream clean musk amber hint spices dust soft woods fleecy softness outweighs drydown l'orpheline like angora blanket hugs skin comforting delicate coziness giving gentle caress meditative incense pillow soft creaminess l'orpheline's transformation complete l'orpheline haute concentration eau de parfum elegant softness make one uncle serge's versatile creations could easily worn work love snuggle long day work serene drydown wonderful antidote stress maybe really love creamy cashmere incense,"aldehydes, cedar wood, fougere accord, coumarin, clouds ambergris, patchouli, incense, cashmeran"

Sotto La Luna Gardenia Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"Sotto La Luna is a world that is secluded, private in a sense. The world is sleeping. The busy human world has come to a rest. Flower pods open, alluring the creatures of the night. Flowers bloom in the light of a celestial body that does not shine itself, but reflects the sun. It is a reminder of the day, a gentle light pouring down from a cold round rock in a frozen galaxy. The moonlight feels like a luminescent fluid poured over a shadow land. The shadows are long and dark. Sotto la luna is joyful and sentimental at the same time.
Tauer's inspiration for Sotto La Luna Gardenia was the imagery of a gardenia under the moon. The scent flowers out with a spicy freshness, it matures into a round, gentle green floral perfume reminiscent of a hundred different flowers, it closes with powdery mosses and a creamy floral woodiness that disappears into the night.

Musc Monoi Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"A traditional Tahitian Monoi, made with handpicked tiare flowers infused for weeks into pure coconut oil, is a precious substance with countless uses: skin oil, moisturizer, perfume, pain reliever. To Patricia de Nicolae, it's the scent that perfectly represents the airy, playfully indulgent essence of summer, a fragrance profile forever linked in her memory to L'Oreal's iconic Ambre Solaire sunscreen. Musc Monoi is de Nicolae's ode to Ambre Solaire, to traditional Monoi, and to every carefree summer memory and sun-kissed beach between the two.
Your very first sniff of Musc Monoi will whisk you to the tropics: rich, sweet ylang ylang and bright, tart citrus energizes and then immediately relaxes, like the first burst of direct sunlight over a lush beachside garden. Magnolia, neroli and jasmine take turns adding to the bouquet, while a tasteful hint of calone suggests a salty ocean breeze, carrying a fresh breath of nature with each shift in the wind. As the musky coconut base fades in, it's as welcome and soothing as a mid-day nap on pillowy-soft white sand. This isn't the smell of sunscreen; it's the smell of you, wearing sunscreen, on the most impossibly beautiful beach in the world.","neroli, lemon, petitgrain, ylang-ylang, jasmine, coconut, calone, magnolia, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31348.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,traditional tahitian monoi made handpicked tiare flowers infused weeks pure coconut oil precious substance countless uses skin oil moisturizer perfume pain reliever patricia de nicolae scent perfectly represents airy playfully indulgent essence summer fragrance profile forever linked memory l'oreal's iconic ambre solaire sunscreen musc monoi de nicolae's ode ambre solaire traditional monoi every carefree summer memory sun kissed beach two first sniff musc monoi whisk tropics rich sweet ylang ylang bright tart citrus energizes immediately relaxes like first burst direct sunlight lush beachside garden magnolia neroli jasmine take turns adding bouquet tasteful hint calone suggests salty ocean breeze carrying fresh breath nature shift wind musky coconut base fades welcome soothing mid day nap pillowy soft white sand smell sunscreen smell wearing sunscreen impossibly beautiful beach world,"neroli, lemon, petitgrain, ylang-ylang, jasmine, coconut, calone, magnolia, sandalwood, musk"
Nymphaea Caerulea Extrait de Parfum,Regime des Fleurs,"An out of body experience, Nymphaea Caerulea dances on the skin with extremely rare hyper-purified extractions of the sacred blue waterlily. The extraction used in Nymphaea Caerulea was only produced once ever in the early 2000s in India. Ã Â¸Â¢ÃÂ The blossoms of two acre-sized ponds worth of Blue Waterlilies were carefully collected before sunrise when their scent was at its most potent. The blooms were then bathed with a special proprietary solution to gently dissolve the flowers and release the aromatic constituents without heat or pressure creating an extraction much like a traditional absolute but more ""clear"" in scent profile. This absolute was then refined further through a very careful low-heat hydro-distilation using only a copper and glass apparatus in the manner of the time-honored traditional attar-making process (but without the use of sandalwood oil), further removing plant particles, waxes, and pigments. The care and precision applied to the production of this material is unparalleled. The result is a natural aromatic material that is stunning and truly once in a lifetime. Like the enchanting call of Sirens to chosen wayward ships, the mesmerizing base of Nymphaea Caerulea features an abundance of genuine white Ambergris, supported by celestial notes and shimmering accords composed of 80 ingredients: both precious naturals and intuitively selected aroma materials.
The touching salty-sweet opening of Nymphaea Caerulea is at once nostalgic, hopeful and altogether new. An uncanny lemony impression that bares no hint of tartness gives way to perfumed leaves and flower water. Constantly wavering between 'deep blue' and 'emerald green', 'air' and 'water', 'boldness' and 'gentleness', the result is a symphonic aquamarine lullaby within a nebula. Among the many intriguing qualities of this perfume is that to some it recalls impressions of various unusual smells: freeze dried apple, toothpaste, glass cleaner... and yet there is an undeniable beauty and constant floralcy that dominates and mesmerizes the senses in the way that burying one's whole face in a giant lotus blossom would. Shimmering salt crystals on unripened berries. Smokeless incensed altar. Waterfall. And finally, the haunting: the boldly lingering, vaguely caramel, oceanic ambergris. The truest scent of mermaid skin; A singing iridescent floral.

Journey Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Like a Chinese dragon, Journey Man opens with a fiery roar filled with Sichuan peppers and bold spices in a golden, boozy flame. The peppers tingle and gently bite, while a richly fruited sweetness intoxicates you with a cognac note. It's a visual of gold and red, but darkness lurks all around, thanks to swirls of incense, an oud-like cypriol woodiness, and a streak of leathery resins in the base. Tobacco, a sprinkling of cardamom, and the juiciness of neroli orange are the final touches to a complex fragrance that grabs your attention from the start.
Journey is slowly transformed by a beautiful creaminess which tames the dragon's fiery bite. A smooth layer of tonka vanilla coats the peppers, dry woodiness, incense, and spices. The cognac booziness turns into ambered warmth, and the perfume lingers more softly on the skin. Over time, Journey turns into a creamy, tonka sweetness with woods, spices, and just a hint of fruit mingle together. It's a bold fragrance whose initial intensity gives way to softness in a rich mix that feels very much like an Amouage.","sichuan pepper, bergamot, cardamom, neroli bigarade, juniper berries, incense, geraniol, tobacco leaves, ambrox, cyriol, tonka bean abstract",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41860.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,like chinese dragon journey man opens fiery roar filled sichuan peppers bold spices golden boozy flame peppers tingle gently bite richly fruited sweetness intoxicates cognac note visual gold red darkness lurks around thanks swirls incense oud like cypriol woodiness streak leathery resins base tobacco sprinkling cardamom juiciness neroli orange final touches complex fragrance grabs attention start journey slowly transformed beautiful creaminess tames dragon's fiery bite smooth layer tonka vanilla coats peppers dry woodiness incense spices cognac booziness turns ambered warmth perfume lingers softly skin time journey turns creamy tonka sweetness woods spices hint fruit mingle together bold fragrance whose initial intensity gives way softness rich mix feels much like amouage,"sichuan pepper, bergamot, cardamom, neroli bigarade, juniper berries, incense, geraniol, tobacco leaves, ambrox, cyriol, tonka bean abstract"

Or du Serail Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir,"A dreamy meditation on dried fruit and Shisha tobacco. If your mind instantly goes to the cherry tobacco that graced your father's pipe in your youth, you're on the right track, but think more humid, more voluptuous, and more intricate. The fruit is a mix of apple, orange, mango and coconut, drizzled with honey and rum. The rich, golden tobacco is layered with greener, sharper aromatics, like clary sage and mate. Throw in amber, vanilla and labdanum and you would assume this would be heavy and velvet-like - but instead it gives the impression of silken veils, each opulent and shimmering with fine embroidery, but sheer and vibrant. The veils float and swirl and each movement creates a different layering, a new set of colors playing against each other. The impression is indeed golden, rather than dark, and playfully seductive. There is a teasing haylike sharpness that freshens the smokiness of the tobacco and the mango and sweet orange give the amber a twist. A luscious vanilla floats through like something delicious being cooked in the next room. Bertrand Duchaufour has concocted a delightful invitation to temptation that hints at decadence in the most graceful way. Charmingly sensuous.","cistus, apple, red fruit effects, mango, rum, sweet orange, davana, sage, bee wax, honey effect, coco, geranium, ylang-ylang, tobacco, amber, labdanum, oak tree, cedar wood, musk, vanilla, mate",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/59302.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dreamy meditation dried fruit shisha tobacco mind instantly goes cherry tobacco graced father's pipe youth right track think humid voluptuous intricate fruit mix apple orange mango coconut drizzled honey rum rich golden tobacco layered greener sharper aromatics like clary sage mate throw amber vanilla labdanum would assume would heavy velvet like instead gives impression silken veils opulent shimmering fine embroidery sheer vibrant veils float swirl movement creates different layering new set colors playing impression indeed golden rather dark playfully seductive teasing haylike sharpness freshens smokiness tobacco mango sweet orange give amber twist luscious vanilla floats like something delicious cooked next room bertrand duchaufour concocted delightful invitation temptation hints decadence graceful way charmingly sensuous,"cistus, apple, red fruit effects, mango, rum, sweet orange, davana, sage, bee wax, honey effect, coco, geranium, ylang-ylang, tobacco, amber, labdanum, oak tree, cedar wood, musk, vanilla, mate"

Corsica Furiosa Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"A verdant blast built around lentiscus, an evergreen shrub typical of Corsica. Wood, moss, earth, hay, honey, and in every shade, its sillage carries the smells of the mountain. Energizing and impetuous.
Furioso. The term, used as a direction in music, means 'to be played rapidly and with passion'... Because Corsica, where Marc- Antoine Corticchiato has his roots, is never restful. It sends your eyes, your nose, your heart into overdrive. So when you're close to bursting with sensations and emotions, you take to the mountains.
The perfumer's new tribute to his homeland was inspired by the moving scent that greets the returning traveler: the green, intense, facetted fragrance of lentiscus, a shrub that grows on the sunny slopes of Corsica, from the highlands to the Mediterranean seaside.
But Corsica Furiosa is far more than that: the quintessence of everything that makes the 'Island of Beauty' unique, fierce and strong. The violent contrasts of its smells, colors, reliefs, passions, secrets...
Since everyone in Corsica has their own recipe for it, a fiery swig of eau-de-vie sets the top notes ablaze. In its combustible wake, it trails the green bite of nepita, a local variety of wild mint. Crisp green tomato leaf intensifies the natural vibe.
When lentiscus kicks in, the plot thickens. The headstrong essential oil is the first to take off. Peppery, fruity, aromatic, then earthy with mushroom overtones, it thrusts itself into the heart of Corsica Furiosa. Then the absolute takes over with a smoother shade of green with hay, blond tobacco, honey and straw accents, darkened with a tinge of liquorish. A third type of extraction, obtained through a special technique, adds wafts of resin, spices and leather that draw you deeper into the mountain... until you come to rest on a bed of moss.","lentiscus oil, eau-de-vie, nepita, lentiscus absolute, tomato leaf, pepper, lentiscus extract original, cistus, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35713.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,verdant blast built around lentiscus evergreen shrub typical corsica wood moss earth hay honey every shade sillage carries smells mountain energizing impetuous furioso term used direction music means 'to played rapidly passion' corsica marc antoine corticchiato roots never restful sends eyes nose heart overdrive close bursting sensations emotions take mountains perfumer's new tribute homeland inspired moving scent greets returning traveler green intense facetted fragrance lentiscus shrub grows sunny slopes corsica highlands mediterranean seaside corsica furiosa far quintessence everything makes 'island beauty' unique fierce strong violent contrasts smells colors reliefs passions secrets since everyone corsica recipe fiery swig eau de vie sets top notes ablaze combustible wake trails green bite nepita local variety wild mint crisp green tomato leaf intensifies natural vibe lentiscus kicks plot thickens headstrong essential oil first take peppery fruity aromatic earthy mushroom overtones thrusts heart corsica furiosa absolute takes smoother shade green hay blond tobacco honey straw accents darkened tinge liquorish third type extraction obtained special technique adds wafts resin spices leather draw deeper mountain come rest bed moss,"lentiscus oil, eau-de-vie, nepita, lentiscus absolute, tomato leaf, pepper, lentiscus extract original, cistus, oakmoss"

Oeillet Louis XV Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"Powdery and peppery, silky and spicy, Oeillet Louis XV soothes yet confuses with its paradoxes. Reminiscent of an ancient time, powder fades and gives way to spicy notes of clove. Oeillet Louis XV is homage to the beloved French King Louis XV who saw Oriza's birth and became its most illustrious customer. White carnation is at the heart of this fragrance and is the source of its dichotomy. A symbol of true love under the monarchy, the flower embodied the fire of the French Revolution. As a scent, white carnation is as intoxicating as the most subtle poison; a delicate blend of mandarin, monarchical iris and light wood chords, which cannot resist the violence of pepper and spicy clove. Pink carnation brings a note of bitterness, a symbol of Mary's sorrow.
Legend has it that the flower sprang where Mary's tears fell as she saw Jesus carry the cross. Contrasts, olfactory and symbolic, best describe 'Oeillet Louis XV', an elegant scent that never ceases to astonish.","pink pepper, mandarin, white carnation, carnation absolute, white orchid, iris, rose, spicy clove, rice powder, white musk, white honey, woody notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65215.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,powdery peppery silky spicy oeillet louis xv soothes yet confuses paradoxes reminiscent ancient time powder fades gives way spicy notes clove oeillet louis xv homage beloved french king louis xv saw oriza's birth became illustrious customer white carnation heart fragrance source dichotomy symbol true love monarchy flower embodied fire french revolution scent white carnation intoxicating subtle poison delicate blend mandarin monarchical iris light wood chords cannot resist violence pepper spicy clove pink carnation brings note bitterness symbol mary's sorrow legend flower sprang mary's tears fell saw jesus carry cross contrasts olfactory symbolic best describe 'oeillet louis xv' elegant scent never ceases astonish,"pink pepper, mandarin, white carnation, carnation absolute, white orchid, iris, rose, spicy clove, rice powder, white musk, white honey, woody notes"

Jardins d'Armide Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"Les Jardins d'Armide are a symbol of beauty, lush and beautiful, full of fragrant flowers and the rarest species. The beautiful gardens were long mythical, but the success of the Renaissance myth of Armida gave these imaginary incomparable gardens a new impetus. The Great Century in France did not escape the attraction of myths. There was a genuine passion for symbolism, illusions, and enchantments. Armide, an emblematic seventeenth century witch, was a woman of great beauty who knew the art of seduction. She best embodies the ambivalent powers of charm. She is inextricably tied to these extraordinary gardens, so much so that the term ""Gardens of Armida"" became a reference in fashion during the subsequent centuries. Throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Gardens of Armida are incessantly referred to in music (Lully, Vivaldi, Handel, Haydn, Rossini ...), painting (Poussin, Van Dyck, Tiepolo, Fragonard ...) and literature. This myth began with another one, the myth of Tasso in the sixteenth century. In 1909, the prestigious Maison de Parfums Oriza L. Legrand presented 'Jardins d'Aramide' to its elegant clientele, le tout-Paris, in its prestigious boutique 11 Place de la Madeleine.
The perfume is a tribute to the legendary gardens and the women who have symbolized them throughout the ages. The Rose, Queen of Flowers, is at the heart of this enchanting bouquet picked in the Garden of Armida. Iris from Florence, wild violet powder, wisteria and carnations from India, whilst honey, almond and musk bring incomparable strength to this tempting elixir.","rose, orange blossom, iris powder, iris, wild violet, wisteria, carnation, honey, almond, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65217.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,les jardins d'armide symbol beauty lush beautiful full fragrant flowers rarest species beautiful gardens long mythical success renaissance myth armida gave imaginary incomparable gardens new impetus great century france escape attraction myths genuine passion symbolism illusions enchantments armide emblematic seventeenth century witch woman great beauty knew art seduction best embodies ambivalent powers charm inextricably tied extraordinary gardens much term gardens armida became reference fashion subsequent centuries throughout seventeenth eighteenth centuries gardens armida incessantly referred music lully vivaldi handel haydn rossini painting poussin van dyck tiepolo fragonard literature myth began another one myth tasso sixteenth century prestigious maison de parfums oriza l legrand presented 'jardins d'aramide' elegant clientele le tout paris prestigious boutique place de la madeleine perfume tribute legendary gardens women symbolized throughout ages rose queen flowers heart enchanting bouquet picked garden armida iris florence wild violet powder wisteria carnations india whilst honey almond musk bring incomparable strength tempting elixir,"rose, orange blossom, iris powder, iris, wild violet, wisteria, carnation, honey, almond, tonka bean, musk"
Reve d'Ossian Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"Ossianizm was a romantic poetry style in Europe in the XIX century. Ossian is the narrator and purported author of a cycle of Celtic and epic poems. Ossian was influential in the development of the romantic movement at the end of the XVIIIth and the XIXth century. The poems achieved international success (Napoleon Bonaparte was a great fan) and many writers, painters and artists were influenced by the works, including Ingres, Schubert and Oriza L. Legrand Perfumes. The work also had a timely resonance for those swept away by the emerging Romantic movement and the theory of the ""noble savage"". ""ReÂve d'Ossian"" is a perfect perfume for those seeking dark and precious essences, wooden notes filled with the mystery of the forest with fairies and pixies...","frankincense, pine wood, cinnamon, benzoin, tonka bean, opopanax, tolu balm, sandalwood, leather, labdanum, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/65218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ossianizm romantic poetry style europe xix century ossian narrator purported author cycle celtic epic poems ossian influential development romantic movement end xviiith xixth century poems achieved international success napoleon bonaparte great fan many writers painters artists influenced works including ingres schubert oriza l legrand perfumes work also timely resonance swept away emerging romantic movement theory noble savage d'ossian perfect perfume seeking dark precious essences wooden notes filled mystery forest fairies pixies,"frankincense, pine wood, cinnamon, benzoin, tonka bean, opopanax, tolu balm, sandalwood, leather, labdanum, amber, musk"

Horizon Eau de Parfum,Oriza L. Legrand,"After World War I, the Roaring Twenties reflected the desire for exoticism and the need for escape, particularly through fashion and decoration. The East and particularly Asia provides new horizons. The frenzy for exotic travel encourages artists to exhibit eastern cultures in their creations: new silk, fine embroidery, pearl beads, woody scents, heady and sweet ...

Fans of the brand will surely recognize that 4160 Tuesdays already has a ""UK beach holiday"" themed scent, but while Sunshine & Pancakes was rich with a variety of creatively evocative notes like jasmine and lemon, What I Did On My Holidays takes aim squarely at the real smells of a boardwalk-laced English holiday area: the kind full of chip shops, clanging arcade rides, and blissfully happy families.

The Sexiest Scent on the Planet. Ever. (IMHO) Eau de Parfum,4160 Tuesdays,"What happened was that Sarah McCartney spent a week in the Hoxton Hotel courtyard in spring 2013, making The Gin Garden scent with gin botanicals and a lovely smooth base for them to blend with.
A couple of people, including the visiting Tatler journalist, fell in love with the base. The name came from one of the comments about it-- so Sarah thought perhaps it would be a good idea to bottle it the way it is. So she did.
The idea was to make a gentle unassuming blend of background scents that wouldn't try to steal the limelight from the more individual gin botanicals. There is a dash of bergamot - a nice quiet citrus - and a soft hint of creamy vanilla. Then there's some velvety smooth woods and (non animal) musk and ambergris floating around. When one of their guests described it as ""The Sexiest Scent On The Planet. Ever. IMHO,"" they knew it had to be shared with the world. That's it really. And it's quite lovely, to say the least.","gin, bergamot, vanilla, woods, musk, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,happened sarah mccartney spent week hoxton hotel courtyard spring making gin garden scent gin botanicals lovely smooth base blend couple people including visiting tatler journalist fell love base name came one comments sarah thought perhaps would good idea bottle way idea make gentle unassuming blend background scents try steal limelight individual gin botanicals dash bergamot nice quiet citrus soft hint creamy vanilla there's velvety smooth woods non animal musk ambergris floating around one guests described sexiest scent planet ever imho knew shared world that's really quite lovely say least,"gin, bergamot, vanilla, woods, musk, ambergris"

Terralba Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"In front of you, the sea. Behind, mediterranean shrubland. It is morning. The smells of shrubs and the earth mingle intimately and indistinguishably with the salty breath of the sea. You walk cautiously on the rocks of the small pathway leading to the beach, following â almost chasing â the sound of the waves, finding your way through the thick vegetation. It is a narrow and steep pathway. You touch the branches of the bushes. A bent branch bleeds a dense and sticky resinous liquid, whose strong and vital scent doesn't want to leave your skin. At last â in front of you â deep blue. The horizon expands and you abandon yourself to the sounds and the view of the mighty ocean sea.
Terralba is a scent for those searching for an immediate mediterranean escape - it calls to mind Antonioni's L'Avventura, where a group of friends scours an isolated island for a woman who has gone missing among the freedom of the breeze and the sound of the waves. It is everything sweet and beautiful about a hike across the heath - no bitterness or sharpness to be found among these swaying shrubs. The green tangerine and everlasting flower lend a soft sweetness while the sage, myrtle, thyme, and lentisc provide a plush herbal background and deep green woods anchor the composition. Perhaps you will lose yourself between the sun-soaked rocks and the waves as well.","clary sage, lemon, green tangerine, myrtle, thyme, curry leaves, everlasting flower, lentisque, juniper, cypress, cedar wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,front sea behind mediterranean shrubland morning smells shrubs earth mingle intimately indistinguishably salty breath sea walk cautiously rocks small pathway leading beach following almost chasing sound waves finding way thick vegetation narrow steep pathway touch branches bushes bent branch bleeds dense sticky resinous liquid whose strong vital scent want leave skin last front deep blue horizon expands abandon sounds view mighty ocean sea terralba scent searching immediate mediterranean escape calls mind antonioni's l'avventura group friends scours isolated island woman gone missing among freedom breeze sound waves everything sweet beautiful hike across heath bitterness sharpness found among swaying shrubs green tangerine everlasting flower lend soft sweetness sage myrtle thyme lentisc provide plush herbal background deep green woods anchor composition perhaps lose sun soaked rocks waves well,"clary sage, lemon, green tangerine, myrtle, thyme, curry leaves, everlasting flower, lentisque, juniper, cypress, cedar wood"
Montecristo Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"You are in the living room of an old villa, in the Tuscan countryside. It is the close of day. Every single element of the interior contributes to the warmth and reassuring comfort. The floor of old robust wood planks, aged and worn with use. In the massive fireplace, coals are still burning. The comfortable couch is made of the best leather, once stout and rigid, and spotlessly tanned, is now soft and worn, and the color is fading away with years of sideways afternoon sun. A deck of used playing cards lies abandoned on the coffee table next to the tobacco leaves of a hand rolled cigar and a glass of rum.
Montecristo strikes an impeccable balance between smokey and sweet and modern and classic. It has an unfaltering solidness yet it maintains a mysterious movement. Smooth notes of ambrette, benzoin, and rum rest atop the enticing sweetness of gaiac wood. Spice and tobacco curl like a plume of smoke in the last rays of sunlight.

Luci Ed Ombre Eau de Parfum,Masque Milano,"You walk through a thick wood where only small beams of light can shine through. The trees are heavy with moss and the soft and spicy scent of earth. Determined blooms of jasmine and tuberose fight for the sparse light that will keep them alive. A shiver runs down your back and you feel the humid breathe of a wolf down your neck. An uneasiness directs you into a broad meadow where the blinding light makes you sneeze. You overturn a log: damp ground and creatures that haven't seen the sun in years. You no longer know where you are or where you long to be. The dark side is irresistibly fascinating, perhaps stronger than any fears and uneasiness it produces.
Luci ed Ombre speaks to chiaroscuro, or the practice of using light and dark in painting for dramatic effect. These opposites not only cohabit a space but also make one another more powerful. The scent portrays both an energetic freshness and a dark animalic truth. Notes of ginger and earthy patchouli balance indolic florals and a wisp of incense. A perfect scent for those seeking something truly mysterious and captivating.","incense, ginger, tuberose, jasmine, moss, cedarwood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,walk thick wood small beams light shine trees heavy moss soft spicy scent earth determined blooms jasmine tuberose fight sparse light keep alive shiver runs back feel humid breathe wolf neck uneasiness directs broad meadow blinding light makes sneeze overturn log damp ground creatures seen sun years longer know long dark side irresistibly fascinating perhaps stronger fears uneasiness produces luci ed ombre speaks chiaroscuro practice using light dark painting dramatic effect opposites cohabit space also make one another powerful scent portrays energetic freshness dark animalic truth notes ginger earthy patchouli balance indolic florals wisp incense perfect scent seeking something truly mysterious captivating,"incense, ginger, tuberose, jasmine, moss, cedarwood, patchouli"
Bal d'Afrique Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Bal d'Afrique is inspired by Paris in the late 1920's, when the city was infatuated with an idiosyncratic and fantastical vision of African culture, music and dance. Paris embraced the fabulous Josephine Baker as its muse and so does this enigmatic and playful scent. Drawing on the euphoric mix of the avant-garde and exoticism that fueled the artistic life of the city, Jerome Epinette has created a fragrance with the exuberant sensuality of La Baker herself. A vivacious blast of sunny citrus with just a pinch of spicy marigold makes a suitably dramatic entrance, leading to a brew of green bucchu, sheer and aqueous cyclamen and sweet violet. At center stage is the ever-bewitching vetiver, earthy and spicy, and smoothed with sweet amber and warm musk until it becomes velvety and almost edible. An extra soupeon of growl is provided by cedar wood, but the overall effect is less voracious man-eating tiger and more of a mischievous tiger cub â sweet and adorable, but it still has claws. Bal d'Afrique is warm and embracing with a purring, cozy quality that has us at its mercy. Be careful, this one is addictive.","bergamot, lemon, neroli, marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bal d'afrique inspired paris late 's city infatuated idiosyncratic fantastical vision african culture music dance paris embraced fabulous josephine baker muse enigmatic playful scent drawing euphoric mix avant garde exoticism fueled artistic life city jerome epinette created fragrance exuberant sensuality la baker vivacious blast sunny citrus pinch spicy marigold makes suitably dramatic entrance leading brew green bucchu sheer aqueous cyclamen sweet violet center stage ever bewitching vetiver earthy spicy smoothed sweet amber warm musk becomes velvety almost edible extra soupeon growl provided cedar wood overall effect less voracious man eating tiger mischievous tiger cub sweet adorable still claws bal d'afrique warm embracing purring cozy quality us mercy careful one addictive,"bergamot, lemon, neroli, marigold, bucchu, violet, jasmin petals, cyclamen, black amber, musk, vetiver, cedarwood"
Pulp Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Pulp is the epitome of ripe fruit, bottled. Imagine that you have just bitten into the juiciest, ripest plum, felt the snap of a crisp apple in your teeth, indulged in a handful of berries ready to explode, all fresh from the fields and orchards, the kiss of the sun still on them. Now put it all in your mouth at the same time and you have the cacophony of fruit that is Pulp. This is grown-up fruit: no sugar-coating, no syrup, just a tiny hint of sweetness to bring out the nuances. With a whiff of blossom and a touch of bark, you can sense an olfactory arc of how the fruit begins, grows, and ripens. Pulp will make you smile and feel a bit giddy, because there is nothing else quite like it.","bergamot, cardamom, black currant, fig, red apple, tiara, cedar wood, praline, peach flower",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,pulp epitome ripe fruit bottled imagine bitten juiciest ripest plum felt snap crisp apple teeth indulged handful berries ready explode fresh fields orchards kiss sun still put mouth time cacophony fruit pulp grown fruit sugar coating syrup tiny hint sweetness bring nuances whiff blossom touch bark sense olfactory arc fruit begins grows ripens pulp make smile feel bit giddy nothing else quite like,"bergamot, cardamom, black currant, fig, red apple, tiara, cedar wood, praline, peach flower"
Gypsy Water Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"This entrancing shape-shifter is one of the most popular fragrances in the Byredo line, and we can understand why. The opening is crisp and outdoorsy â strong, vibrant citrus, cool juniper and sharp pine needles. Floating incense and the sweet earthiness of orris help to set the scene: camping under an inky deep blue sky studded with brilliant stars, surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of smoke cutting through the chilly night air. As this wears on the skin, warm elements begin to flicker beneath the cool and sharp ones like the glowing embers of a campfire â golden amber, creamy vanilla and luscious sandalwood. A warm, soft, dreamy skin scent emerges, still with lovely cool traces of juniper, lemon and incense wafting over the top. This has all the soft, amber coziness of a beloved cashmere sweater last worn to a bonfire on the winter solstice, with traces of smoke and pine and night air in its threads. It is the danger of a long wild night remembered from a warm and safe place. Richly evocative and absolutely gorgeous.","bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64103.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,entrancing shape shifter one popular fragrances byredo line understand opening crisp outdoorsy strong vibrant citrus cool juniper sharp pine needles floating incense sweet earthiness orris help set scene camping inky deep blue sky studded brilliant stars surrounded pine trees hint smoke cutting chilly night air wears skin warm elements begin flicker beneath cool sharp ones like glowing embers campfire golden amber creamy vanilla luscious sandalwood warm soft dreamy skin scent emerges still lovely cool traces juniper lemon incense wafting top soft amber coziness beloved cashmere sweater last worn bonfire winter solstice traces smoke pine night air threads danger long wild night remembered warm safe place richly evocative absolutely gorgeous,"bergamot, lemon, pepper, juniper berries, incense, pine needles, orris, amber, vanilla, sandalwood"
Rose Noir Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Some roses are best smelled in the dark. Rose Noir takes the innocence of a fresh Damascene rose and tramples it underfoot. The romance of the bed strewn with rose petals intensifies as the petals mingle with the decadent fragrances of sensuality. You can languish in that aroma, made peppery by freesia, and darkened with earthy cistus, green moss, and animalic musk. Rose Noir is a contemporary rose, dirtied up and served with a nice dollop of sensuality.","grapefruit, freesia, rose damascena, cistus, moss, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,roses best smelled dark rose noir takes innocence fresh damascene rose tramples underfoot romance bed strewn rose petals intensifies petals mingle decadent fragrances sensuality languish aroma made peppery freesia darkened earthy cistus green moss animalic musk rose noir contemporary rose dirtied served nice dollop sensuality,"grapefruit, freesia, rose damascena, cistus, moss, musk"
Blanche Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"An effortlessly lovely ode to the color white. This opens with the crystalline sharpness of aldehydes, and then eases into a gentle white floral washed with soft sandalwood and transparent musk. Blanche is as light as a bubble floating on a warm summer wind and as clean as the steam from a long, hot shower. This is definitely in the family of freshly laundered scents, but it has a delicious warmth at its core that sets it apart. The ephemeral sweetness of the violet is anchored with the delectable milky richness of the sandalwood. Blanche does not bring to mind harsh detergents or astringent cleansers, but rather the creamy lather of French-milled soap on clean, wet skin. As sheer and weightless as silk chiffon, you could wrap yourself in it and it would still read as delicate and airy. A classic and elegant rendering of the concept of 'clean', it balances the brisk, fresh elements with soft, sensual ones. Pure and beautiful.","white rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64106.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,effortlessly lovely ode color white opens crystalline sharpness aldehydes eases gentle white floral washed soft sandalwood transparent musk blanche light bubble floating warm summer wind clean steam long hot shower definitely family freshly laundered scents delicious warmth core sets apart ephemeral sweetness violet anchored delectable milky richness sandalwood blanche bring mind harsh detergents astringent cleansers rather creamy lather french milled soap clean wet skin sheer weightless silk chiffon could wrap would still read delicate airy classic elegant rendering concept 'clean' balances brisk fresh elements soft sensual ones pure beautiful,"white rose, pink pepper, aldehyde, violet, neroli, peony, blonde woods, sandalwood, musk"
Sunday Cologne Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"In the 18th century, the Italian perfume maker of the original Eau de Cologne, Giovanni Maria Farina, wrote to his brother that, 'I have found a fragrance that reminds me of an Italian spring morning, of mountain daffodils and orange blossoms after the rain.'
The essential qualities of eau de cologne, the lightest of all the perfume categories, with their fresh and casually elegant mix of citrus, floral, and herb oils, have remained intact throughout the centuries. This basic DNA of eau de cologne remains in Byredo's Sunday Cologne, but with added body and depth, warmth and diffusion. Star anise and cardamom add a touch of olfactory heat and sweetness to Sunday Cologne. Meanwhile, incense adds a spicy bite; patchouli displays a rough, camphorous glow; moss and vetiver harmonize to add a touch of earthiness. Sunday Cologne perfectly balances crispness with warmth, convention with edge.","bergamot, star anise, cardamom, geranium, incense, lavender, vetiver, moss, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,th century italian perfume maker original eau de cologne giovanni maria farina wrote brother 'i found fragrance reminds italian spring morning mountain daffodils orange blossoms rain ' essential qualities eau de cologne lightest perfume categories fresh casually elegant mix citrus floral herb oils remained intact throughout centuries basic dna eau de cologne remains byredo's sunday cologne added body depth warmth diffusion star anise cardamom add touch olfactory heat sweetness sunday cologne meanwhile incense adds spicy bite patchouli displays rough camphorous glow moss vetiver harmonize add touch earthiness sunday cologne perfectly balances crispness warmth convention edge,"bergamot, star anise, cardamom, geranium, incense, lavender, vetiver, moss, patchouli"
Baudelaire Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"...A lazy isle to which nature has given singular trees, savory fruits, men with bodies vigorous and slender, and women in whose eyes shines a startling candor.'
The poet Charles Baudelaire, famously a lover of perfume and the exoticism of faraway lands, was by turns cerebral, sensual, perverse, and sentimental. Byredo's homage to the French dandy reflects this mercurial nature with its multiple olfactory dimensions.
A gentle sweetness lies at the heart of Baudelaire, with hyacinth warmed by amber and a touch of fruit. This sentimental center gives way to the aromatics of caraway, patchouli, and juniper berries, with their green whiff of the brisk outdoors. Baudelaire's base truly provides a counterpoint to its initial warmth, the way that his poetry often launches into philosophy: sensuality gives way to aridity, with a dry, incense-y base of leather, patchouli and papyrus.
Earthy yet worldly, warm yet sophisticated, Baudelaire is as elegant as a dandy's walking stick.","juniper berry, black pepper, caraway, incense, hyacinth, leather, papyrus, patchouli, black amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64108.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lazy isle nature given singular trees savory fruits men bodies vigorous slender women whose eyes shines startling candor ' poet charles baudelaire famously lover perfume exoticism faraway lands turns cerebral sensual perverse sentimental byredo's homage french dandy reflects mercurial nature multiple olfactory dimensions gentle sweetness lies heart baudelaire hyacinth warmed amber touch fruit sentimental center gives way aromatics caraway patchouli juniper berries green whiff brisk outdoors baudelaire's base truly provides counterpoint initial warmth way poetry often launches philosophy sensuality gives way aridity dry incense base leather patchouli papyrus earthy yet worldly warm yet sophisticated baudelaire elegant dandy's walking stick,"juniper berry, black pepper, caraway, incense, hyacinth, leather, papyrus, patchouli, black amber"
La Tulipe Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"A graceful rendering of the scent of a single, perfect tulip. What's that you say? You don't recall tulips having much of a scent? You are not alone. According to Byredo creator Ben Gorham, 'A lot of people say that tulips don't have a scent, so this is a fantasy based on the idea of a tulip.' And we agree that this exquisitely realized soliflore of the imagination is exactly what a tulip should smell like. Clean, modern and bright, with an intensely floral heart and a bit of green stem that has broken through the icy ground to start the spring.
La Tulipe captures the slight bit of waxiness of the tulip petals, thanks to rhubarb, and the cool, damp earthiness of the bulb, courtesy of vetiver. It is refreshingly unsweet, and has a clarity and charm that makes it one of our favorites for those days when one just craves a breath of fresh air. La Tulipe is as simple and elegant as a single red tulip in a crystal vase and just as appropriate for any occasion.","rhubarb, cyclamen, freesia, tulip, blond woods, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64109.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,graceful rendering scent single perfect tulip what's say recall tulips much scent alone according byredo creator ben gorham 'a lot people say tulips scent fantasy based idea tulip ' agree exquisitely realized soliflore imagination exactly tulip smell like clean modern bright intensely floral heart bit green stem broken icy ground start spring la tulipe captures slight bit waxiness tulip petals thanks rhubarb cool damp earthiness bulb courtesy vetiver refreshingly unsweet clarity charm makes one favorites days one craves breath fresh air la tulipe simple elegant single red tulip crystal vase appropriate occasion,"rhubarb, cyclamen, freesia, tulip, blond woods, vetiver"
Accord Oud,BYREDO,"Byredo's Accord Oud presents a striking set of olfactory opposites. The warm sweetness of blackberry and boozy rum pair with a camphorous glow from patchouli. And saffron's rounded softness is set against the sharp and smoky birch of a leather accord. Powdery musks resolve and fill in some of these opposites, and notes like clary sage complement the birch and patchouli.
A resinous, aromatic, fruity leather, Byredo's Accord Oud suggests that oud is as much a mysterious set of olfactory characteristics â sweet, medicinal, soft, and dark â as it is an actual perfume note.","blackberry, saffron, rum, leather accord, clary sage, patchouli, powdery musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,byredo's accord oud presents striking set olfactory opposites warm sweetness blackberry boozy rum pair camphorous glow patchouli saffron's rounded softness set sharp smoky birch leather accord powdery musks resolve fill opposites notes like clary sage complement birch patchouli resinous aromatic fruity leather byredo's accord oud suggests oud much mysterious set olfactory characteristics sweet medicinal soft dark actual perfume note,"blackberry, saffron, rum, leather accord, clary sage, patchouli, powdery musk"
Oud Immortel Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Oud is often thought of as dark, brooding and mysterious. Even the way it comes into the world has a whiff of drama about it: When the Aquilaria tree is infected by a mold, it secretes a protective resin which eventually becomes the precious, fragrant oud wood note.
But Byredo's Oud Immortel bucks the trend and puts a smoky, earthy oud accord in the background, even though its name has top billing. It opens with a gourmand vanillic lemon accord, which contrasts with an earthy, herbaceous base of tobacco leaves, moss, patchouli and papyrus. This base cuts the sweetness with a mysterious dryness, making the scent edgier than sweet scents usually are. And, although it's not listed, it would make sense if the immortel flower, both savory and syrupy sweet, were romping around in Oud Immortel.
Oud Immortel's lemon scent is courtesy of Limoncello, the aromatic citrus-fruity, candied Italian digestif, the major key personality to the oud's minor key. In the background, the slightly medicinal, camphory vibe from patchouli allows a brighter, happier, fruitier character to speak, accented with warming spices of cardamom.
Smoke and mystery combine with sweetness and warmth to create a paradoxical fragrance both friendly and mysterious. Oud Immortel invites you in with candied lemon and cardamom, and then leaves you entranced with its smoky tobacco leaves, sheer oud accord, and moss.","limoncello, incense, cardamom, patchouli, papyrus, rosewood, tobacco leaves, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64113.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oud often thought dark brooding mysterious even way comes world whiff drama aquilaria tree infected mold secretes protective resin eventually becomes precious fragrant oud wood note byredo's oud immortel bucks trend puts smoky earthy oud accord background even though name top billing opens gourmand vanillic lemon accord contrasts earthy herbaceous base tobacco leaves moss patchouli papyrus base cuts sweetness mysterious dryness making scent edgier sweet scents usually although listed would make sense immortel flower savory syrupy sweet romping around oud immortel oud immortel's lemon scent courtesy limoncello aromatic citrus fruity candied italian digestif major key personality oud's minor key background slightly medicinal camphory vibe patchouli allows brighter happier fruitier character speak accented warming spices cardamom smoke mystery combine sweetness warmth create paradoxical fragrance friendly mysterious oud immortel invites candied lemon cardamom leaves entranced smoky tobacco leaves sheer oud accord moss,"limoncello, incense, cardamom, patchouli, papyrus, rosewood, tobacco leaves, moss"
Black Saffron Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Saffron is a spice. Saffron is a color. Saffron is a way of life. Black Saffron pays tribute to the many facets of saffron, weaving a spell of a spice symbolic of India. A vibrant citrus opening belies the deeper heart of the perfume. The aroma of saffron starts to wrap around you like holy robes, earthy and unmistakable. A dewy rose emerges, tickling your nose with a soft sweetness. Then, there it is, the surprise of leather nestled among the woods and vetiver. At once ancient and modern, Black Saffron brings all the traditions of the East alive while winking at you from the seat of a sleek motorcycle.
Byredo founder Ben Gorham, who was raised in India, worked with perfumer Jerome Epinette to create this homage to the holy spice that has become a symbol of India.","pomelo, saffron, juniper berries, black violet, accord cuir, cristal rose, blonde woods, raspberry, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64116.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,saffron spice saffron color saffron way life black saffron pays tribute many facets saffron weaving spell spice symbolic india vibrant citrus opening belies deeper heart perfume aroma saffron starts wrap around like holy robes earthy unmistakable dewy rose emerges tickling nose soft sweetness surprise leather nestled among woods vetiver ancient modern black saffron brings traditions east alive winking seat sleek motorcycle byredo founder ben gorham raised india worked perfumer jerome epinette create homage holy spice become symbol india,"pomelo, saffron, juniper berries, black violet, accord cuir, cristal rose, blonde woods, raspberry, vetiver"
Inflorescence Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"A freshly cut bouquet of flowers that has been supercharged, as if struck by electricity or cross-bred with blossoms from another planet: radiant lily of the valley, honeyed freesia, creamy magnolia, incandescent jasmine âÂ all captured at the height of their bloom, dazzling and stark white in contrast to glossy green leaves. The lily of the valley is especially vivid and luminous, giving this the heightened, otherworldly beauty of a perfect day in spring, with the skies a bright enameled blue and the new grass so vivid it is almost neon.
Inflorescence is airy and euphoric. There is nothing dark or heavy to weigh down the dewy green notes or the profusion of glowing flowers. It has a scintillating lightness, in the sense that it floats and trills like a flute solo, not in the sense of being a shy or soft scent. This is bright and strongly present and joyously feminine from beginning to end.","rose petals, pink freesia, magnolia, lily of the valley, fresh jasmine",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64117.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,freshly cut bouquet flowers supercharged struck electricity cross bred blossoms another planet radiant lily valley honeyed freesia creamy magnolia incandescent jasmine captured height bloom dazzling stark white contrast glossy green leaves lily valley especially vivid luminous giving heightened otherworldly beauty perfect day spring skies bright enameled blue new grass vivid almost neon inflorescence airy euphoric nothing dark heavy weigh dewy green notes profusion glowing flowers scintillating lightness sense floats trills like flute solo sense shy soft scent bright strongly present joyously feminine beginning end,"rose petals, pink freesia, magnolia, lily valley, fresh jasmine"
1996 Eau de Parfum,BYREDO,"Byredo's 1996 perfume was inspired by Dutch photography duo Inez van Lamsweerde & Vinoodh Matadin's photographâÂKirsten 1996, ' which depicts an angelic child, her face seemingly dusted with white powder, her eyes closed and lips lacquered like a geisha's. 1996 is its olfactory counterpart: gentle and dreamy, with an undertow of dark erotics.
1996 bursts forth with a cloud of amber-scented iris, as powdery-soft and diffuse as the incandescent photograph itself. A leather accord dosed with patchouli and black pepper gives its ethereal, confectionary opening some heft and drama. Inez & Vinoodh move freely between both the fashion and art worlds and are known for their hyper-real and digitally retouched photos. They put a sheen of the otherworldly onto their images, and there is something both earthy â the leather, patchouli and rootiness of iris â and elusive and dreamy about 1996, as if an added layer of fairy dust were sprinkled onto its more legible notes.
Byredo founder Ben Gorham has said that 1996 is 'an olfactory snapshot not only of the image but of our emotional response to it.' Enigmatic and romantic, 1996 will be sure to elicit perfume lust and emotion.","juniper berries, black pepper, violet, leather accord, orris, patchouli, black amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/64119.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,byredo's perfume inspired dutch photography duo inez van lamsweerde vinoodh matadin's photograph kirsten ' depicts angelic child face seemingly dusted white powder eyes closed lips lacquered like geisha's olfactory counterpart gentle dreamy undertow dark erotics bursts forth cloud amber scented iris powdery soft diffuse incandescent photograph leather accord dosed patchouli black pepper gives ethereal confectionary opening heft drama inez vinoodh move freely fashion art worlds known hyper real digitally retouched photos put sheen otherworldly onto images something earthy leather patchouli rootiness iris elusive dreamy added layer fairy dust sprinkled onto legible notes byredo founder ben gorham said 'an olfactory snapshot image emotional response ' enigmatic romantic sure elicit perfume lust emotion,"juniper berries, black pepper, violet, leather accord, orris, patchouli, black amber, vanilla"

Nuit Andalouse Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"A dreamy white floral centered around gardenia, the queen of tropical flowers. Nuit Andalouse opens with a sweet, delicate violet that perfectly sets the stage for the euphoric gardenia ahead, like a flower girl dropping petals before the radiant bride steps down the aisle. A sparkling orange note appears, clear and bell-like, which then blends with heady orange blossom, soft creamy vanilla and the luminous gardenia to create a fragrance with the luscious, but airy, quality of a mousse or semifreddo â smooth and delicious, but never too heavy or rich. Created by Cecile Zarokian, this lovely scent pulls off the difficult feat of balancing elegance and charm. It is as exquisitely feminine as the rustle of silk skirts and as light-hearted as a kiss blown in the wind. Rose and ylang ylang contribute to the lushness of the flowers and sensuous sandalwood and musk add cozy warmth. All of these elements are but supporting players to the gardenia, however â doing whatever is necessary to show off our sweet and glowing diva to her best effect.

Eight and Bob Eau de Parfum,Eight and Bob,"When American student John F. Kennedy met Parisian aristocrat Albert Fouquet on the Cotes d'Azur in the 1930s, not only was he charmed by the man, he was also intrigued by his hand-crafted scent. Upon his return to the US, JFK made a quirky request for eight samples 'and if your production allows, another one for Bob'.
EIGHT & BOB, as the cologne came to be known, was a hit with the Hollywood elite, but it would languish for decades after Albert's tragic death in a car crash. WWII forced Fouquet's loyal butler Philippe â the only other person who knew the cologne's formula â to hide his final shipment of bottles inside books that he carefully cut by hand.
But EIGHT & BOB has returned. Based on its original formula, this bright, elegant cologne with the rare 'Andrea' plant extract from the Andes. The Andrea species is a wild plant in short supply due to the altitude and limited area in which it grows, and can only be picked during the months of December and January. The plants gathered undergo a very exacting selection process in which only seven percent are chosen. This process ends between March and April and only then is it known how many units of EIGHT & BOB can be bottled for the year.
A fragrance with a history, EIGHT & BOB is a true perfume event. The bottle is hidden in a book, just as it was long ago.","citrus, spice accord, violet, iris, cedar, sandalwood, gaiac, ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63901.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,american student john f kennedy met parisian aristocrat albert fouquet cotes d'azur charmed man also intrigued hand crafted scent upon return us jfk made quirky request eight samples 'and production allows another one bob' eight bob cologne came known hit hollywood elite would languish decades albert's tragic death car crash wwii forced fouquet's loyal butler philippe person knew cologne's formula hide final shipment bottles inside books carefully cut hand eight bob returned based original formula bright elegant cologne rare 'andrea' plant extract andes andrea species wild plant short supply due altitude limited area grows picked months december january plants gathered undergo exacting selection process seven percent chosen process ends march april known many units eight bob bottled year fragrance history eight bob true perfume event bottle hidden book long ago,"citrus, spice accord, violet, iris, cedar, sandalwood, gaiac, ambergris"

Cuir Garamante Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Leather can be many things â stern military boots, a worn-in saddle, a comfy chair. Cuir Garamante is a leather jacket â thick but supple â worn by a mysterious man who travels the world for reasons he keeps to himself. Journalist? Jewel thief? Spy? This is a jacket that has been to spice bazaars and state dinners and secret parties. It has snuck into palaces and jumped out of planes and hidden in opium dens. The opening has a tantalizing spiciness swirled with a swoony, boozy sweetness. Rich saffron, delicious nutmeg and sultry rose pave the way for the luxurious leather that is the central player. Although this leather does have the creamy aspect we love, it also has simmering animalic sensuality. It's a little bit rough, a little bit dirty and deeply sexy. Oud-like incense and sharp papyrus heighten the edgier qualities, while vanilla and sandalwood add a luscious warmth and smoothness. Weaving in and out is labdanum â smoky, sweetly resinous and mesmerizing. Addictive and fiendishly attractive â this is an outstanding interpretation of leather, one of our favorite notes.","pink pepper, nutmeg, saffron, rose, oud accord, papyrus, leather, vanilla, labdanum, incense, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36514.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,leather many things stern military boots worn saddle comfy chair cuir garamante leather jacket thick supple worn mysterious man travels world reasons keeps journalist jewel thief spy jacket spice bazaars state dinners secret parties snuck palaces jumped planes hidden opium dens opening tantalizing spiciness swirled swoony boozy sweetness rich saffron delicious nutmeg sultry rose pave way luxurious leather central player although leather creamy aspect love also simmering animalic sensuality little bit rough little bit dirty deeply sexy oud like incense sharp papyrus heighten edgier qualities vanilla sandalwood add luscious warmth smoothness weaving labdanum smoky sweetly resinous mesmerizing addictive fiendishly attractive outstanding interpretation leather one favorite notes,"pink pepper, nutmeg, saffron, rose, oud accord, papyrus, leather, vanilla, labdanum, incense, sandalwood"
Black,Comme des Garcons: PLAY,"What's black? Pepper, lapsang souchong tea, birch tar... even tree moss can bring a lacquered black vibe to a scent. Black Play leans towards the fougere, but with an intriguing, salty twist that can almost be tasted, and a metallic, rosy undercurrent. A very light powdery effect conjured by the tree moss and violet turns these dusky accords into the deep matte velvet of a black swallowtail wing.

Thirty Three Eau de Parfum,Ex Idolo,"Thirty-three is a fragrance crafted from very special ingredients. The soul of the fragrance is built around a vintage oud - distilled in 1980 and aged until its release in 2013. It is also the only modern perfume to use a significant amount of wild-harvested Chinese oud oil and natural Chinese rose oil to build the scent profile. Contrary to most ouds however, Thirty-three is a surprisingly soft and velvety fragrance, and genuinely fits in an innovative space in terms of the wider oud category.

Black Parfum Extrait,Puredistance,"What does black mean to you? Is it the darkened room in which you dream, the glistening menace of a panther's fur, the nervous stab of a blot of ink? What do you think black smells like? The smoking screech of a rubber tire, the rainbow shimmer of an oil slick, the sweaty leather of a rebel?
Here is what Black smells like. An aura of spice and incense in a darkened temple, lit only by smoldering candles, surrounds you as you reach a deep meditative state.

Sugi Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle,"Sugi â also known as Japanese cedar â is popular as an ornamental plant in Japan and has a delicate, clean and energising fragrance. After the great success of our first collaborations with Comme des Garcons â Hinoki and Laurel â we've returned to them for this third scent, which has been developed in Paris by Antoine Maisondieu and comes in a Monocle-designed bottle and box. It's a refreshing unisex scent that's light but sophisticated, beginning with top notes of Mediterranean cypress and pepper from Madagascar, followed by iris from Florence and cedar from Virginia, and finished with pine and Haitian vetiver.","cypress, pepper, iris, cedar, pine, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41703.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sugi also known japanese cedar popular ornamental plant japan delicate clean energising fragrance great success first collaborations comme des garcons hinoki laurel we've returned third scent developed paris antoine maisondieu comes monocle designed bottle box refreshing unisex scent that's light sophisticated beginning top notes mediterranean cypress pepper madagascar followed iris florence cedar virginia finished pine haitian vetiver,"cypress, pepper, iris, cedar, pine, vetiver"
Red Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY,"What's red? A cherry. But Antoine Maisondieu didn't want to resort to the usual tricks of the trade, so he conjured it from a quality of Tolu balsam with a cherry facet, added safraleine for shine â and a leather effect that keeps the sweetness in check --, a drop of red mandarin for sweet juiciness as well as osmanthus and myrrh for their fruity effects. The heart burns like a cinnamon candy, freshened with geranium. This cheery cherry is a totally new interpretation of the note, without a drop of added sugar: it takes the 'tart' out of the pie, sticks it back in the tree, and is guaranteed to raise the big goofy grin you'd get if you were a kid let loose on an orchard.","red mandarin, pink peppercorn, safraleine, red cherry accord, geranium, cinnamon, osmanthus, myrrh, tolu balsam",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,what's red cherry antoine maisondieu want resort usual tricks trade conjured quality tolu balsam cherry facet added safraleine shine leather effect keeps sweetness check drop red mandarin sweet juiciness well osmanthus myrrh fruity effects heart burns like cinnamon candy freshened geranium cheery cherry totally new interpretation note without drop added sugar takes 'tart' pie sticks back tree guaranteed raise big goofy grin get kid let loose orchard,"red mandarin, pink peppercorn, safraleine, red cherry accord, geranium, cinnamon, osmanthus, myrrh, tolu balsam"
Green Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: PLAY,"What's green? Mint, lime, basil... Green Play opens with a sap-filled burst of the former, the 'nanah' used in Moroccan mint tea, a sweet variety with a slight absinth facet, churned into a sparkling fresh brew by lime and juniper berry, with green apple effects. Mastic (also known as lentisque) intensifies the greenness while also adding a soft balsamic note, blending with the vegetal musk of ambrette to keep the mint's exuberance in check.

Laurel Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle,"Lebanon has been popping up on the radar as one of the hippest travel destinations on the planet, and it's no wonder the two trend-setters who already teamed up for the best-selling Hinoki, Comme des Garcons and Monocle magazine, found inspiration in the Country of the Cedars for their Scent Two. 'We wanted to capture the same smell and sensation enjoyed while staying with friends in Batroun, Lebanon. It's warm, inviting and at times a little sharp â just like the country, ' says Monocle editor in chief, Tyler Brule.
Cedar, then, obviously, tinged with incense â after all, 'Lebanon' and 'olibanum', another name for frankincense, share the same etymology â and the namesake laurel (the antiseptic laurel bay essential oil is used in Lebanon to make the traditional, olive-oil based Alep soap). A dash of herbs sprinkled with pepper on a warm amber base infuse Laurel with a dry, bracing aroma that redefines the very notion of freshness perfumery. A stunning achievement.","laurel, pepper, cedar, patchouli, incense, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41702.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,lebanon popping radar one hippest travel destinations planet wonder two trend setters already teamed best selling hinoki comme des garcons monocle magazine found inspiration country cedars scent two 'we wanted capture smell sensation enjoyed staying friends batroun lebanon warm inviting times little sharp like country ' says monocle editor chief tyler brule cedar obviously tinged incense 'lebanon' 'olibanum' another name frankincense share etymology namesake laurel antiseptic laurel bay essential oil used lebanon make traditional olive oil based alep soap dash herbs sprinkled pepper warm amber base infuse laurel dry bracing aroma redefines notion freshness perfumery stunning achievement,"laurel, pepper, cedar, patchouli, incense, amber"
Hinoki Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Monocle,"Hinoki takes its name from the hinoki cypress, a tree that only grows in Japan and is the preferred wood for building palaces, temples, shrines and the finest wooden soaking baths. It was inspired by a visit to Tawaraya, a famous three-centuries-old traditional Japanese inn located in Kyoto. Soaking in the legendary open-air hinoki ofuro (wooden bath) filled with warm spring water on a chilly morning, the idea for the perfume was born and the result is breathtaking. The ofuro is captured perfectly: the full, rich scent of the wood, the smells of the surrounding greenery, the soft touch of meditative incense, the memories of native moss. Hinoki is a dry, woody-fresh scent with an intangible 'something' that gives it a mystical edge and the ability, much like CdG's Incense Series, to conjure the exact emotion and feel of the idea behind its creation and name.","cypress, turpentine, camphor, cedar, thyme, pine, georgian wood, frankincense, moss vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,hinoki takes name hinoki cypress tree grows japan preferred wood building palaces temples shrines finest wooden soaking baths inspired visit tawaraya famous three centuries old traditional japanese inn located kyoto soaking legendary open air hinoki ofuro wooden bath filled warm spring water chilly morning idea perfume born result breathtaking ofuro captured perfectly full rich scent wood smells surrounding greenery soft touch meditative incense memories native moss hinoki dry woody fresh scent intangible 'something' gives mystical edge ability much like cdg's incense series conjure exact emotion feel idea behind creation name,"cypress, turpentine, camphor, cedar, thyme, pine, georgian wood, frankincense, moss vetiver"
Oud Wood Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends. Today, not only has Oud Wood become one of the brand's classics, but it has spawned the brand-newâÂOud Collection', built around the original's core accord of oud, sandalwood and patchouli.
Oud Wood's packaging may have changed, but fear not: you'll find the same powerful blend of cool spices and smoky woods, softened with a hint of vanilla and tonka bean. The daunting, medicinal and overly animalic facets of oud are toned down, translating the precious agarwood into a darkly elegant element of the perfumer's palette rather than a full-on French-Arabian extravaganza. As chic, urbane and sharply-cut as Mr. Ford's James Bond suits in Skyfall. And just as much of a sexy beast as Daniel Craig.","oud, pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tom ford pioneered oud note contemporary western perfumery way back tenure artistic director yves saint laurent groundbreaking still one showcase private blends today oud wood become one brand's classics spawned brand new oud collection' built around original's core accord oud sandalwood patchouli oud wood's packaging may changed fear find powerful blend cool spices smoky woods softened hint vanilla tonka bean daunting medicinal overly animalic facets oud toned translating precious agarwood darkly elegant element perfumer's palette rather full french arabian extravaganza chic urbane sharply cut mr ford's james bond suits skyfall much sexy beast daniel craig,"oud, pepper, pink pepper, cardamom, birch tar, cistus, incense, sandalwood, vetiver, patchouli, cedarwood, vanilla, tonka bean"
Tobacco Oud Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"It was Tom Ford who pioneered the oud note in contemporary Western perfumery way back in 2002 during his tenure as the artistic director of Yves Saint Laurent, with the groundbreaking M7. In 2007, he was still one of the few to showcase it in his own Private Blends with Oud Wood.
Along with the latter and Oud Fleur, Tobacco Oud is part of the brand-new 'Oud Collection'. And in case you were wondering, any resemblance with Tobacco Vanille â a firm favorite in the Private Blends â is most emphatically not coincidental, since Tobacco Oud was composed by the very same perfumer, Olivier Gillotin. Here, the vanilla is ousted by â obviously âÂ oud. The tobacco accord is less of a mellow pipe tobacco though it retains the delectable almondy inflection of tonka. Instead, it was inspired by dokha, a traditional 'blend of herbs, flowers and spice-laden tobacco'. And a heady blend it is, matching the fragrant smokes of oud resin and aromatic tobacco, with none of the side effects...
If you've been hankering for a darker, sultrier, woodier version of Tobacco Vanille, or like to tame your oud with a touch of sweetness, a whiff of this might turn your head: it's one of Mr. Ford's most addictive offerings to date.","oud, tobacco dust absolute, coriander, cistus, labdanum, cedarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, roasted organic tonka bean, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63527.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tom ford pioneered oud note contemporary western perfumery way back tenure artistic director yves saint laurent groundbreaking still one showcase private blends oud wood along latter oud fleur tobacco oud part brand new 'oud collection' case wondering resemblance tobacco vanille firm favorite private blends emphatically coincidental since tobacco oud composed perfumer olivier gillotin vanilla ousted obviously oud tobacco accord less mellow pipe tobacco though retains delectable almondy inflection tonka instead inspired dokha traditional 'blend herbs flowers spice laden tobacco' heady blend matching fragrant smokes oud resin aromatic tobacco none side effects hankering darker sultrier woodier version tobacco vanille like tame oud touch sweetness whiff might turn head one mr ford's addictive offerings date,"oud, tobacco dust absolute, coriander, cistus, labdanum, cedarwood, patchouli, sandalwood, roasted organic tonka bean, castoreum"
Fate Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"In the final creation that expresses the end of the first cycle of the Amouage narrative, 'Fate' for man and woman explores the uncertainty of the future and the universal principal by which the order of things is inescapably prescribed. The immutable fragrances are presented in Amouage's iconic clear glass-crystal bottles with a rainbow undertone with gold plated caps accented with an aurora borealis inspired Swarovski crystal.
Fate Man is one of those rare perfumes where you just have to try it to understand it. It begins with an opening salvo of absinthe and herbs through a heart of immortelle swathed in the most luxurious frankincense. The wheel of fortune that is Fate Man ends up on cedar and licorice to bring this stunning perfume to a close. Despite being labeled as masculine, Fate Man is a true shared fragrance and if you are a fan of Amouage-- this is a must try. Fate Man is as ever-changing as the swirling colors on the rainbow coated flacon; the experience is slightly altered every time you wear it.","mandarin, saffron, absinthe, ginger, cumin, everlasting flower, rose, frankincense, lavandin, cistus, copahu, labdanum, cedarwood, liquorice, tonka bean, sandalwood, muske",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41847.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,final creation expresses end first cycle amouage narrative 'fate' man woman explores uncertainty future universal principal order things inescapably prescribed immutable fragrances presented amouage's iconic clear glass crystal bottles rainbow undertone gold plated caps accented aurora borealis inspired swarovski crystal fate man one rare perfumes try understand begins opening salvo absinthe herbs heart immortelle swathed luxurious frankincense wheel fortune fate man ends cedar licorice bring stunning perfume close despite labeled masculine fate man true shared fragrance fan amouage must try fate man ever changing swirling colors rainbow coated flacon experience slightly altered every time wear,"mandarin, saffron, absinthe, ginger, cumin, everlasting flower, rose, frankincense, lavandin, cistus, copahu, labdanum, cedarwood, liquorice, tonka bean, sandalwood, muske"
Fate Woman,Amouage,"Awarded 5 Stars (Masterpiece) by Luca Turin'How time flies. It seems only yesterday (actually five full years) that Christopher Chong took over Amouage's art direction and propelled this Omani firm, then known chiefly for its classic no-expense-spared Gold, into the first rank of perfumery. Chong is that rare bird, a natural perfumery art-director, who knows what he wants and will not give up until he finally smells it. In a recent interview with Style.com/Arabia, he said that Fate was a loud fragrance, so one expects a massively-built monster like the wonderful Ubar reissue in 2009. The surprise begins with the first puff from the spray: a fresh, radiant, powdery advance guard briefly fills the room. Seconds later, you are faced with one of the most intricate and beguiling fragrances in years. Nothing this big, complex and beautiful has been done since the first Boucheron. Though the top has a Guerlain-like appetizing feel, Fate borrows its core from Opium, i.e., woody-balsamic with an emphatic dose of the cool minty note that separates it from the merely warm, dusky Cabochard-Cinnabar style. Opium's virtue was its novel, instantly recognizable tune, of which we eventually tired. But don't let the reference put you off. Fate is to Opium what Mitsouko was to Coty's Chypre: a transfiguration. The central structure is deep in there, now cloaked in a cloud of radiant dust borrowed from the unstructured opulence of Gold, plus â a brilliant touch â a dry, fresh cigar-box cedar note to guard against excessive sweetness. Loud? Possibly, but comfortably so, without harshness or distortion. Like very few fragrances, Fate delivers the rush of physical glee you get when you sit in the front row of the stalls and a great orchestra begins to play. Just don't wear it to supper.' â Luca Turin, Style.com/Arabia","bergamot, cinnamon, chilli, pepper, rose, narcissus, jasmine, frankincense, labdanum, vanilla bean, benzoin, castoreum, patchouli, oakmoss, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41848.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,awarded stars masterpiece luca turin'how time flies seems yesterday actually five full years christopher chong took amouage's art direction propelled omani firm known chiefly classic expense spared gold first rank perfumery chong rare bird natural perfumery art director knows wants give finally smells recent interview style com/arabia said fate loud fragrance one expects massively built monster like wonderful ubar reissue surprise begins first puff spray fresh radiant powdery advance guard briefly fills room seconds later faced one intricate beguiling fragrances years nothing big complex beautiful done since first boucheron though top guerlain like appetizing feel fate borrows core opium e woody balsamic emphatic dose cool minty note separates merely warm dusky cabochard cinnabar style opium's virtue novel instantly recognizable tune eventually tired let reference put fate opium mitsouko coty's chypre transfiguration central structure deep cloaked cloud radiant dust borrowed unstructured opulence gold plus brilliant touch dry fresh cigar box cedar note guard excessive sweetness loud possibly comfortably without harshness distortion like fragrances fate delivers rush physical glee get sit front row stalls great orchestra begins play wear supper ' luca turin style com/arabia,"bergamot, cinnamon, chilli, pepper, rose, narcissus, jasmine, frankincense, labdanum, vanilla bean, benzoin, castoreum, patchouli, oakmoss, leather"
Nemer Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious,"Determined to source a rare and precious Oud for the heart of this exclusive scent, the Boadicea perfumers discovered Tiger Oud. The Tiger Oud name derives from the variegated heart wood of a tree. When the wood is cut, as if by magic, the stripes of a tiger appear. The heart note also provided inspiration for the name of this precious scent â Nemer being the Arabic word for Tiger. Tiger Oud is copper distilled and is beautifully fluid â ensuring Nemers' sense of indulgent luxury and unmistakable quality.
The fragrance contains some of the worlds finest ingredients, including; Saffron, Turkish Rose, Jasmine absolute and Indonesian Patchouli.

Zagorsk Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense,"Built around a 14th century monastery, the Russian holy spot of Zagorsk lends its name to this fragrance. Zagorsk opens with a surge of crisp pine and cedar. At its heart is an almost clean feeling... like pinecones strewn on brand-new snow on a dark winter's eve. Pretty poetic, and so is Zagorsk. At the base is Russia's famous birch wood, but not smoky, just the memory of old, fragrant fires burned in an Orthodox church in the middle of a forest.

It's the scent of gothic cathedrals and Papal palaces, of tapestries imbued with centuries of incense. Of cold marble steps, holy relics and dark confessions. The recognizable smells of frankincense and myrrh open the high mass of Avignon, giving way to the almost eye-smarting, gloriously smoky and resinous heart. A dry vanilla and soft Roman chamomile dull the edges of this reverent fragrance.

Jaisalmer Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Incense,"Named after the ancient desert city in India, Jaisalmer was inspired by the spices and woods that passed through its namesake trade route, linking India to Egypt. Throughout the Incense series, CdG took at least one element associated with the city/country from which each of the scents take their name; in Jaisalmer, prized Indian ebony is added to resinous guaiac hardwood at the base, while a healthy dose of spice comprises the opening.

Lapis Philosophorum Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"Olivier Durbano's mineral-based fragrances have always been a labor of love, an attempt to synthesize the physical properties of his chosen inspiration with their deeper symbolic significance. With Lapis Philosophorum, Olivier has for the first time focused on an element not found in nature- the mythical Philosopher's Stone, legendary in the ancient world for its ability to change basic stone into gold- and the results are simply extraordinary.
Lapis opens with an enticing, wine-laden burst of sweetness that is quickly tempered by Olivier's signature incense accord. Those familiar with Black Tourmaline will appreciate that warm, comforting embrace that keeps you sniffing for more. Truffle and menthol are unusual ingredients, and here they play out in a very subtle manner- truffle adds a creamy, ethereal element, while menthol, barely detectable, adds a liveliness to the composition that keeps it aloft. A rich base of opoponax, oakmoss and myrhh smooth the disparate edges while harkening to an ancient era where magic had yet to disappear from the world. Intoxicating, lively, and truly unique, Lapis Philosophorum is not so much a radical departure for Olivier Durbano, but rather the ultimate example of his ability to take unlikely ingredients and create pure magic.","calamus, juniper, rum, white truffle, grapefruit, wine sediment, frankincense, mesquite, ambergris, menthol, opoponax, myrrh, musk, oak moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36912.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,olivier durbano's mineral based fragrances always labor love attempt synthesize physical properties chosen inspiration deeper symbolic significance lapis philosophorum olivier first time focused element found nature mythical philosopher's stone legendary ancient world ability change basic stone gold results simply extraordinary lapis opens enticing wine laden burst sweetness quickly tempered olivier's signature incense accord familiar black tourmaline appreciate warm comforting embrace keeps sniffing truffle menthol unusual ingredients play subtle manner truffle adds creamy ethereal element menthol barely detectable adds liveliness composition keeps aloft rich base opoponax oakmoss myrhh smooth disparate edges harkening ancient era magic yet disappear world intoxicating lively truly unique lapis philosophorum much radical departure olivier durbano rather ultimate example ability take unlikely ingredients create pure magic,"calamus, juniper, rum, white truffle, grapefruit, wine sediment, frankincense, mesquite, ambergris, menthol, opoponax, myrrh, musk, oak moss"
Violette Fumee,Mona di Orio,"With the creation of Violette Fumee, Mona composed the melody of my favorite passions, memories and materials.
With flirty florals like violet and rose fumed with pipe tobacco, the exquisite smoothness of cashmere and suede, and deep resinous undertones, this warmly smoldering scent evokes my sensorial love for luxury, and makes me feel, dream, travel and remember.
Revved at the start, crisp, fresh notes of herbal lavender and sparkling bergamot pair with inky oakmoss and get a twist as the scent unfolds into the elegance of vetiver and clary sage.
The shy violet and iconic rose develop into a powdery and gourmand fume and then ramp up as spicy and savory notes of aphrodisiac saffron and smoky bois de gaiac communicate with the florals and begin to ignite.
The smoldering continues as resinous opoponax, myrrh, and musky cashmeran dive slowly into an intense velvety embrace.' â Jeroen Oude Sogtoen, Partner & Creative Director for Maison Mona di Orio.","lavender, bergamot, oakmoss, violet flowers leaves, rose, vetiver, clary sage, opoponax, myrrh, cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51725.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,creation violette fumee mona composed melody favorite passions memories materials flirty florals like violet rose fumed pipe tobacco exquisite smoothness cashmere suede deep resinous undertones warmly smoldering scent evokes sensorial love luxury makes feel dream travel remember revved start crisp fresh notes herbal lavender sparkling bergamot pair inky oakmoss get twist scent unfolds elegance vetiver clary sage shy violet iconic rose develop powdery gourmand fume ramp spicy savory notes aphrodisiac saffron smoky bois de gaiac communicate florals begin ignite smoldering continues resinous opoponax myrrh musky cashmeran dive slowly intense velvety embrace ' jeroen oude sogtoen partner creative director maison mona di orio,"lavender, bergamot, oakmoss, violet flowers leaves, rose, vetiver, clary sage, opoponax, myrrh, cashmeran"
Champaca Absolute Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Tom Ford's Champaca Absolute seems to glow from within with a melange of warm fruit and floral notes that melt into a balsamic base. The Champaca flower has a soft, gentle, hard-to-place complexity, with notes of wood, spice, and mint. In Champaca Absolute, that note is combined with magnolia (with its delicate apricot facet), jasmine, and a marron glace accord (chestnuts candied and glazed in sugar syrup). Champaca combined with the fresh-yet-sensuous magnolia smells not only like flowers that have been kissed by the sun â their notes, as a result, warmed up and heightened â but it also has a natural, petals-just-stripped-from-the-flower ripeness, giving a momentary impression of crushed petals releasing a slightly tropical scent.","tokaji wine, cognac, bergamot, magnolia champaca, orchid, violet, jasmine, vanilla, amber, sandalwood, marron glaceÂ",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tom ford's champaca absolute seems glow within melange warm fruit floral notes melt balsamic base champaca flower soft gentle hard place complexity notes wood spice mint champaca absolute note combined magnolia delicate apricot facet jasmine marron glace accord chestnuts candied glazed sugar syrup champaca combined fresh yet sensuous magnolia smells like flowers kissed sun notes result warmed heightened also natural petals stripped flower ripeness giving momentary impression crushed petals releasing slightly tropical scent,"tokaji wine, cognac, bergamot, magnolia champaca, orchid, violet, jasmine, vanilla, amber, sandalwood, marron glaceÂ"
Jasmin Rouge Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Jasmine is one of those perfume ingredients that can be played in many keys, depending on the pitch wanted â high, green and fresh, or low, indolic-dirty, and languid. Tom Ford's Jasmine Rouge/Private Label starts off like a fine glass of champagne, with a bubbly effervescence courtesy of an aldehyde-driven bergamot and mandarine. As it develops with piquante neroli, languid-to-tropical, waxy ylang-ylang, and warming, beguiling spices, Jasmine Rouge seems to explode into variations on jasmine's richness and lightness. Towards the end, balsamic notes of vanilla and amber combine with a subtle woodsy-leather accord to wrap sparkling jasmine in their warm embrace, like a leather jacket on top of delicate, bare shoulders.","bergamot, mandarine, cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, ginger, clary, neroli, ylang-ylang, vanilla, leather, amber, wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63507.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,jasmine one perfume ingredients played many keys depending pitch wanted high green fresh low indolic dirty languid tom ford's jasmine rouge/private label starts like fine glass champagne bubbly effervescence courtesy aldehyde driven bergamot mandarine develops piquante neroli languid tropical waxy ylang ylang warming beguiling spices jasmine rouge seems explode variations jasmine's richness lightness towards end balsamic notes vanilla amber combine subtle woodsy leather accord wrap sparkling jasmine warm embrace like leather jacket top delicate bare shoulders,"bergamot, mandarine, cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, ginger, clary, neroli, ylang-ylang, vanilla, leather, amber, wood"
Neroli Portofino Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Like a bespoke white shirt, Neroli Portofino takes the classic, citrus-driven lightness of the eau de cologne formula and amps up the quality of its ingredients and, as a result, their fit on the skin. It opens with a luscious burst of neroli and layers of citrus notes, including bergamot, lemon and pittosporum, with its heady, jasmine-and-orange blossom-like bouquet. It then accents this bouquet with green and dusky herbs, including rosemary and lavender. This burst of freshness is warmed by an understated woody and amber base.

Noir de Noir Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Certain scents smell like the (olfactory) lights are out, and you're walking into a room trying to see what's inside it. In Tom Ford's dark rose scent Noir de Noir, as the name suggests, black is indeed the name of the game. But once you adjust your eyes, the rose and its handmaidens glimmer like rich jewels glowing in the dark. This inky, goth, midnight rose is cloaked with mantles of oud, amber, and camphory patchouli. Saffron and truffle notes create a soft veil around this darkness, with a hint of vanilla, and tree moss adds a little more texture in the base.

Santal Blush Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"Don't let the 'blush' in Tom Ford's Santal Blush perfume fool you into thinking this is a shy or retreating scent. It's more of an exploration of the multi-dimensionality of the buttery-beautiful sandalwood note.
Like looking at a cross-section of cut wood with its repeating but differentiated rings, sniffing Tom Ford's Santal Blush provides an olfactory version of similar-but-different reverberating facets of sandalwood. It opens with a creamy, almost coconut-y and even fig-fruit richness. Bold Indian spices of cumin and cinnamon give Santal Blush a temporary hot-and-heavy feral energy. As carrot seeds and fenugreek add a vegetal, waxy depth, chic, sandalwood calls in its reinforcements: cedar and oud, softened by musk. Soft, spicy, creamy, and sexy, Santal Blush is more forward than its name.","spices, cumin, cinnamon, carrot seeds, fenugreek, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, sandalwood, cedar, benzoin, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63510.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,let 'blush' tom ford's santal blush perfume fool thinking shy retreating scent exploration multi dimensionality buttery beautiful sandalwood note like looking cross section cut wood repeating differentiated rings sniffing tom ford's santal blush provides olfactory version similar different reverberating facets sandalwood opens creamy almost coconut even fig fruit richness bold indian spices cumin cinnamon give santal blush temporary hot heavy feral energy carrot seeds fenugreek add vegetal waxy depth chic sandalwood calls reinforcements cedar oud softened musk soft spicy creamy sexy santal blush forward name,"spices, cumin, cinnamon, carrot seeds, fenugreek, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, sandalwood, cedar, benzoin, musk"
Tobacco Vanille Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"In the sumptuous and comforting Tobacco Vanilla, one of Tom Ford's Private Blends, a gourmand, marzipan-like fruit chewiness greets you at the gate â the combination of the scent's multi-faceted cinnamon-vanilla-like tonka note combined with vanilla, cocoa, and dried fruit. But as they hit you, they're joined by mellow, even aged tobacco notes that add a dry elegance and club room gravitas to its subtle sweetness.

Tuscan Leather Eau de Parfum,TOM FORD Private Blend,"In Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather, a smoky, bitter birch-tar leather accord combines with thyme, raspberry, and saffron to create a scent paradox: A perfume that's both clean and sultry, bone-dry and sweet. Although it remains a true leather scent through and through, Tuscan Leather shows its refined, softer side, by letting an herbal, fruity and sheer floral sweetness (night blooming jasmine) break its toughness like a leather jacket that gets softer and more supple with wear.

Aqua Vitae Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"It was one afternoon on Formentera, in the Balearic Islands, that the idea of Aqua Vitae came to my mind. Riding an old motorbike, taking it slowly in view of the extreme heat, the air on my face was deliciously cool. The sun intensified the fragrances of the nature around me. Aqua Vitae, the water of life, when life is quite simply beautiful, an extremely sensitive sensuality enveloped with an uncontained freshness.' â Francis Kurkdjian Kurkdjian's gorgeous ode to a summer afternoon opens with a sparkling combination of Calabrian lemon and Sicilian mandarin, evoking the sensual fullness of 'uncontained freshness.' Dazzling Hedione adds with the warmth of the sun while waves of tonka bean and vanilla counter with a cooling breeze.
In its final phase, Aqua Vitae softens to a sunkissed, sandy drydown. By no means is it a fresh dab of coppertone - no beachy coconut here, but rather a whisper of vanilla-sweetened guaiac lingering close to the skin. It's a gentle reminder of summer afternoon caught on the skin, still warm from the sun.","lemon, mandarin, tonka bean, vanilla infusion, hedione guaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,one afternoon formentera balearic islands idea aqua vitae came mind riding old motorbike taking slowly view extreme heat air face deliciously cool sun intensified fragrances nature around aqua vitae water life life quite simply beautiful extremely sensitive sensuality enveloped uncontained freshness ' francis kurkdjian kurkdjian's gorgeous ode summer afternoon opens sparkling combination calabrian lemon sicilian mandarin evoking sensual fullness 'uncontained freshness ' dazzling hedione adds warmth sun waves tonka bean vanilla counter cooling breeze final phase aqua vitae softens sunkissed sandy drydown means fresh dab coppertone beachy coconut rather whisper vanilla sweetened guaiac lingering close skin gentle reminder summer afternoon caught skin still warm sun,"lemon, mandarin, tonka bean, vanilla infusion, hedione guaiac wood"
Classical Eau de Parfum,Anat Fritz,"Inspired by Berlin designer Anat Fritz's youthful memories of sun-drenched weekends in the countryside, Classical has long been that rare fragrance that evokes a near-universal sense of childhood. Now, having been reworked by one of Germany's most renowned noses (we're not supposed to tell), Classical has upped the ante, taking an already bright and comforting scent and rounding it out into a luminously nostalgic Eau de Parfum meant to take each wearer on their own unique journey.
Just as before, Classical features three essential main ingredients. Wild lavender is still the beating heart of the fragrance, underpinned with rich cedarwood and gentle vetiver to evoke images of lush forests and rolling meadows full of children at play. In Anat's new reformulation, however, the Lavender is toned down, and complemented with the addition of creamy sandalwood--adding a blast of air and light, smoothing the edges into a shimmering composition that perfectly captures the ethereal beauty of a childhood memory- no matter where you grew up.","lavender, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35002.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,inspired berlin designer anat fritz's youthful memories sun drenched weekends countryside classical long rare fragrance evokes near universal sense childhood reworked one germany's renowned noses we're supposed tell classical upped ante taking already bright comforting scent rounding luminously nostalgic eau de parfum meant take wearer unique journey classical features three essential main ingredients wild lavender still beating heart fragrance underpinned rich cedarwood gentle vetiver evoke images lush forests rolling meadows full children play anat's new reformulation however lavender toned complemented addition creamy sandalwood adding blast air light smoothing edges shimmering composition perfectly captures ethereal beauty childhood memory matter grew,"lavender, vetiver, cedar, sandalwood"
Java Blossom Attar / perfume oil,Xerjoff - XJ Oud Attars,"Java Blossom is by far the coolest and smoothest in the Xerjoff Oud Attars collection.

Jeke Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse,"Jeke is a tobacco based fragrance with ornaments of spice, smoke and sweetness. Its heart is a rich accord of tobacco absolutes (Bulgarian, French and Spanish) paired with bourbon vanilla absolute and honey to create a sweet, milky tobacco base.

Norne Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse,"Few locations on earth bridge the gap between the terrestrial and the supernatural like the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Dominated by towering old-growth trees, shrouded in fog and deciduous shadow, these forests represent the few remaining places where mankind's dominion over the planet is far from absolute, and the wisdom of nature still supersedes the passing concerns of civilization. With Norne, Slumberhouse aims to capture the essence of this mystical place, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary.
One glance of the ominously beautiful bright-black liquid makes it clear that Norne is far from a typical natural fragrance, and with the first powerful blast of fresh, resinous fir, it's confirmed. As the scent develops, other deeply complex woodland elements emerge: green moss, earthy fungus, fog, and a touch of slightly sweet incense that evokes images of a roaring campfire cutting through the damp air. While the clarity and strength of these notes is almost hard to believe, the explanation is simple: Norne is made with 100% forest absolutes, a complicated and costly process that avoids synthetics and essential oils in favor of natural, powerful ingredients. The result is a fragrance of unparalleled potency and depth, entirely suited to its subject. For lovers of the outdoors, fragrance enthusiasts in search of the truly unique, or anyone with a love for the ethereal, Norne is not to be missed.","fog caked needle, lichen, fern, moss, hemlock, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,locations earth bridge gap terrestrial supernatural like forests pacific northwest dominated towering old growth trees shrouded fog deciduous shadow forests represent remaining places mankind's dominion planet far absolute wisdom nature still supersedes passing concerns civilization norne slumberhouse aims capture essence mystical place results nothing short extraordinary one glance ominously beautiful bright black liquid makes clear norne far typical natural fragrance first powerful blast fresh resinous fir confirmed scent develops deeply complex woodland elements emerge green moss earthy fungus fog touch slightly sweet incense evokes images roaring campfire cutting damp air clarity strength notes almost hard believe explanation simple norne made forest absolutes complicated costly process avoids synthetics essential oils favor natural powerful ingredients result fragrance unparalleled potency depth entirely suited subject lovers outdoors fragrance enthusiasts search truly unique anyone love ethereal norne missed,"fog caked needle, lichen, fern, moss, hemlock, incense"
Ore Parfum Extrait,Slumberhouse,"Gourmand fragrances aren't supposed to be dangerous, but nobody seems to have told Slumberhouse. That's good news for all of us, because Ore, with its sensuous heart of dry cocoa, lactonic balsams and dark wood, makes us think more of the bedroom than the dinner table. From the first smell of tantalizingly complex dry cocoa, it's evident that Ore has no intention of following in the footsteps of a typical gourmand. This is a rich, raw cacao note that blends seamlessly into the dark guaiac and oakwood to evoke the kind of sensual decadence that has nothing to do with the calorie count. A boozy caramel delivers enough warmth to bring a comforting balance to the mystery and provides a backdrop for the creamy balsam that's quickly becoming creator Josh Lobb's signature. No matter how you feel about traditional gourmands, one smell of Ore will be more than enough to make you hope that Slumberhouse never stops breaking the rules.","oakwood, cocoa, mahogany, guaiac, dittany crete (oregano), vanilla, whiskey lactone, resin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,gourmand fragrances supposed dangerous nobody seems told slumberhouse that's good news us ore sensuous heart dry cocoa lactonic balsams dark wood makes us think bedroom dinner table first smell tantalizingly complex dry cocoa evident ore intention following footsteps typical gourmand rich raw cacao note blends seamlessly dark guaiac oakwood evoke kind sensual decadence nothing calorie count boozy caramel delivers enough warmth bring comforting balance mystery provides backdrop creamy balsam that's quickly becoming creator josh lobb's signature matter feel traditional gourmands one smell ore enough make hope slumberhouse never stops breaking rules,"oakwood, cocoa, mahogany, guaiac, dittany crete (oregano), vanilla, whiskey lactone, resin"
40 Knots Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club,"No ordinary aquatic, 40 Knots captures the essence of the famous Italian yacht club and the Mediterranean air. One of Xerjoff's signature traits is an uncanny ability to harmonize the most extreme intervals -- sparkling aquatic top notes in perfect balance with the deepest, darkest bases - like the sea itself with a sparkling surface and fathomless depth. 40 Knots opens with a sea breeze, warmed by sun-kissed, vegetal greens and cooled by the surface of the salty water. The bracing, nearly menthol, salt note ebbs and flows through the entire drydown, which gets darker, woodier, and richer with emerging notes of coffee, cedar, and clove.

Comandante Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club,"A fine cigar, like an exquisite fragrance, allows you the opportunity to momentarily step away from the routine of everyday life and savor the nuance of an extraordinary sensory experience. With Comandante, Xerjoff captures not only the essence of a perfectly crafted cigar, but also the ritual that goes with it, resulting in a meditative fragrance that's sure to whisk away your cares like smoke on the wind.
Comandante opens with the slight sweetness of an expensive cigar before the match is ever struck: cherry, spicy fruit and a distinct note of honey hint at the complexity that awaits. As the metaphorical smoke begins to waft, the tobacco asserts itself, cloaked in leather and a rich amber that together convey a patient, dignified introspection. Throughout it all, a wonderfully soapy iris keeps Comandante from ever falling into a typical barbershop scent and reminds us that the most exclusive clubs choose the most deserving men and women alike. It's not always easy to find a spare moment to appreciate a truly fine cigar, but with Comandante, it's only a deep breath away.","floral, fruity, spicy, sweet, tobacco, cedar, spicy notes, floral notes, fruity notes, patchouli, honey, leather, vanilla, flowery citrus, spicy green",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63205.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fine cigar like exquisite fragrance allows opportunity momentarily step away routine everyday life savor nuance extraordinary sensory experience comandante xerjoff captures essence perfectly crafted cigar also ritual goes resulting meditative fragrance that's sure whisk away cares like smoke wind comandante opens slight sweetness expensive cigar match ever struck cherry spicy fruit distinct note honey hint complexity awaits metaphorical smoke begins waft tobacco asserts cloaked leather rich amber together convey patient dignified introspection throughout wonderfully soapy iris keeps comandante ever falling typical barbershop scent reminds us exclusive clubs choose deserving men women alike always easy find spare moment appreciate truly fine cigar comandante deep breath away,"floral, fruity, spicy, sweet, tobacco, cedar, spicy notes, floral notes, fruity notes, patchouli, honey, leather, vanilla, flowery citrus, spicy green"
More than Words Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff - Join the Club,"As Xerjoff's homage to literature and poetry, More Than Words is proof that the greatest phrases often come from unexpected combinations. Part sumptuous fruity floral, part complex resin-drenched oriental, More Than Words achieves true poetic balance with a composition that celebrates the individuality of its disparate elements without ever sacrificing the captivating blend of the whole fragrance.
While an intoxicating accord of sweet fruit dominates the opening of More Than Words, it also indicates the unpredictability to come, with individual moments of smoky labdanum and wood creeping in just enough to surprise and enchant. As the sweetness dries, the fragrance bounds further into exotic territory, with oud and benzoin providing a warm, sensual backdrop. A waxing and waning frankincense brings everything together with such natural precision that it's easy to forget how bold the whole thing really is. Like all great writing, More Than Words is something more than the sum of its parts.","floral, fruity, oud, spicy, olibanum, labdanum, ambergris, fruity notes, woody notes, oriental notes, agarwood, floral notes",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/63207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,xerjoff's homage literature poetry words proof greatest phrases often come unexpected combinations part sumptuous fruity floral part complex resin drenched oriental words achieves true poetic balance composition celebrates individuality disparate elements without ever sacrificing captivating blend whole fragrance intoxicating accord sweet fruit dominates opening words also indicates unpredictability come individual moments smoky labdanum wood creeping enough surprise enchant sweetness dries fragrance bounds exotic territory oud benzoin providing warm sensual backdrop waxing waning frankincense brings everything together natural precision easy forget bold whole thing really like great writing words something sum parts,"floral, fruity, oud, spicy, olibanum, labdanum, ambergris, fruity notes, woody notes, oriental notes, agarwood, floral notes"

Trunks, maps, and the adrenaline of travel are interpreted in this adventurous composition through a blend of spices, smoke and wood that is both exotic and comforting. Sweet aromatic herbs mix with spice for a fresh, almost mentholated start.

Playing with the Devil Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Playing with the Devil is the fourth edition in Kilian's series of tributes to forbidden fruits. Here, as with the rest of the series, he uses the concept of good & evil as inspiration for a modern fruit-led composition. And as with the three previous scents in the series, naughty always wins out. The nectar freshness of lychee and the crispness of white peach playfully engage black pepper and pimento. The effect is a top with both a flirty tartness and a soft, powdery gauziness. All the crispness in the opening eventually gives way to a woody floral heart, wherein May Rose and jasmine Sambac soften earthy wood notes of cedar, Sandalwood and patchouli. The rich, woody heart grows softer, even more powdery, and increasingly sensual as it dries down into its final animalic-tinged oriental base of tonka, benzoin and vanilla.
Whatever games Kilian and perfumer Calice Becker were intending to evoke in Playing with the Devil, it seems the fun takes a delightful turn for the risque - perhaps like a seemingly innocuous game of Truth or Dare. It never fully abandons its freshness, and never gets too dark or dirty, but rather hints at a sensuality that every girl (good or bad) would want in her scent arsenal.","blood orange, black currant, white peach, lychee, pepper, pimento, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, rose, jasmine, tonka, benzoin, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42570.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,playing devil fourth edition kilian's series tributes forbidden fruits rest series uses concept good evil inspiration modern fruit led composition three previous scents series naughty always wins nectar freshness lychee crispness white peach playfully engage black pepper pimento effect top flirty tartness soft powdery gauziness crispness opening eventually gives way woody floral heart wherein may rose jasmine sambac soften earthy wood notes cedar sandalwood patchouli rich woody heart grows softer even powdery increasingly sensual dries final animalic tinged oriental base tonka benzoin vanilla whatever games kilian perfumer calice becker intending evoke playing devil seems fun takes delightful turn risque perhaps like seemingly innocuous game truth dare never fully abandons freshness never gets dark dirty rather hints sensuality every girl good bad would want scent arsenal,"blood orange, black currant, white peach, lychee, pepper, pimento, cedar, sandalwood, patchouli, rose, jasmine, tonka, benzoin, vanilla"
Coccobello Eau de Parfum,HEELEY,"Coccobello is truly intriguing and not your typical beach scent. It is at once creamy and green, sweet and fresh, classic and cutting edge. Think glamorous high-fashion resort wear spread in Vogue mixed with the lush and colorful tropical paintings of Henri Rousseau. We know - it's that good. Coccobello begins slightly green with wafts of palm leaves, cedar, and watery coconut. While it remains a nice scent on paper, Coccobello absolutely comes to life on skin and works some kind of magic that we're still trying to figure out. The benzoin, vanilla, and gardenia start a party that might end up with someone getting bitten, and something like mango butter makes an unexpected cameo. The scent projects into a gorgeous, creamy, and slightly fruity veil of scent that lifts you away onto the perfect tropical beach vignette: the breeze whispering through the palm trees, a cold drink in your hand, salt water dripping onto your towel, and nearby gardenias blooming with abandon. This may be the best vacation you've ever taken.","palm leaves, gardenia, coconut, sea salt, vanilla bourbon, virgina cedar, sandalwood, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31513.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,coccobello truly intriguing typical beach scent creamy green sweet fresh classic cutting edge think glamorous high fashion resort wear spread vogue mixed lush colorful tropical paintings henri rousseau know good coccobello begins slightly green wafts palm leaves cedar watery coconut remains nice scent paper coccobello absolutely comes life skin works kind magic we're still trying figure benzoin vanilla gardenia start party might end someone getting bitten something like mango butter makes unexpected cameo scent projects gorgeous creamy slightly fruity veil scent lifts away onto perfect tropical beach vignette breeze whispering palm trees cold drink hand salt water dripping onto towel nearby gardenias blooming abandon may best vacation ever taken,"palm leaves, gardenia, coconut, sea salt, vanilla bourbon, virgina cedar, sandalwood, benzoin"
1899 - Ernest Hemingway Eau de Parfum,Histoires de Parfums,"Born on the edge of a century that changed the world order, Ernest Hemingway was involved in the u-turn events of his era. From USA to Spain, from Italy, then Paris to Cuba, Hemingway's journeys tell a lot about his convictions.
Founder of a new genre, his writings depicted a new vision of the world, mixing reality and fiction. Intellectual and activist, compromise was none of his kind, as Hemingway always succeed in finding his own way, and thus, his unique style.
Hemingway's passion was captured in this fragrance. From soldier, to adventurer, journalist and at last writer, his brilliant route invites us to travel, imagine and move to action. This is a tribute to a vibrant and raw man.
Gerald Ghislain, created an oneiric scent for 1899. The top notes of Italian bergamot, juniper and pepper are intended to be the aperitif that sparks the conversation and awakens the palate in anticipation of the meal. Following Papa from Spain to Italy with Mediterranean scents that evaporate to leave place to a darker mood, where the amber and vetiver mixed is reminiscent of the waxed wood of a Cuban bar top. The exotic meets the familiar, the tropical heat is cooled off by a glass of scotch.","bergamot, juniper, black pepper, orange blossom, iris, cinammon, vanilla, vetiver, yellow amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57624.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,born edge century changed world order ernest hemingway involved u turn events era usa spain italy paris cuba hemingway's journeys tell lot convictions founder new genre writings depicted new vision world mixing reality fiction intellectual activist compromise none kind hemingway always succeed finding way thus unique style hemingway's passion captured fragrance soldier adventurer journalist last writer brilliant route invites us travel imagine move action tribute vibrant raw man gerald ghislain created oneiric scent top notes italian bergamot juniper pepper intended aperitif sparks conversation awakens palate anticipation meal following papa spain italy mediterranean scents evaporate leave place darker mood amber vetiver mixed reminiscent waxed wood cuban bar top exotic meets familiar tropical heat cooled glass scotch,"bergamot, juniper, black pepper, orange blossom, iris, cinammon, vanilla, vetiver, yellow amber"
Standard Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons x Artek,"After Monocle, Stephen Jones and Daphne Guinness, Comme des Garcons partners up with the cult Finnish design company Artek, founded by Alvar Aalto, to launch a fragrance with a distinctly Boreal flavor. Comme des Garcons' trademark 'anti-perfume' notes â in this case, a hint of metallic tang bolstering the lemon-ginger opening â blended with two seldom-used materials gathered in the Great North: Finnish Labrador Tea (also known as Indian Tea), extracted from a fir-smelling evergreen shrub, and twinflower, an almond-tinged blossom from the honeysuckle family. The overall effect, however, is unmistakably Comme des Garcons: a medicinal-woody scent, vibrant with the combustible, pencil-shaving fumes of cedar and a cold, almost incense-like effect. Highly diffusive, totally distinctive and as elegantly pared-down as Alvar Aalto's iconic Mid-century Modern designs. You can't get edgier than that.","finnish labrador tea, twinflower (linnea borealis), fennel, ginger, lemon, musk, saffron, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,monocle stephen jones daphne guinness comme des garcons partners cult finnish design company artek founded alvar aalto launch fragrance distinctly boreal flavor comme des garcons' trademark 'anti perfume' notes case hint metallic tang bolstering lemon ginger opening blended two seldom used materials gathered great north finnish labrador tea also known indian tea extracted fir smelling evergreen shrub twinflower almond tinged blossom honeysuckle family overall effect however unmistakably comme des garcons medicinal woody scent vibrant combustible pencil shaving fumes cedar cold almost incense like effect highly diffusive totally distinctive elegantly pared alvar aalto's iconic mid century modern designs can't get edgier,"finnish labrador tea, twinflower (linnea borealis), fennel, ginger, lemon, musk, saffron, cedarwood"
Almost Transparent Blue Eau de Toilette,A Lab on Fire,"Almost Transparent Blue takes the classic elements of cologne and tweaks them to create a futuristic urban citrus, with hints of pavement and ink. The yuzu and lime in the opening are beautifully crystalline and sharply realistic, and the citrus stays crisp and sparkling as the scent evolves. A brisk, hyper-real soap note emerges, with subtle hints of something industrial underneath. This has the stark feel of an abandoned city â a landscape carved in glass and steel, spare and stripped clean and angular, with empty monorail tracks slicing through the sky. The chilly aldehydes are countered by warm cedar and the dry and clarifying scent of hinoki, the prized cypress that grows only in Japan. Hinoki wood is used to make the finest soaking baths and it has a distinctive, incense-like scent â airy, but haunting. Our first impression of this was cool, clean and simple, but as we spend more time with it, we would strike the word simple. This ultramodern blend of citrus and wood has just enough strangeness to make it utterly compelling.","lime, yuzu, thyme flower, aldehyde, hinoki, cedar wood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/56708.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,almost transparent blue takes classic elements cologne tweaks create futuristic urban citrus hints pavement ink yuzu lime opening beautifully crystalline sharply realistic citrus stays crisp sparkling scent evolves brisk hyper real soap note emerges subtle hints something industrial underneath stark feel abandoned city landscape carved glass steel spare stripped clean angular empty monorail tracks slicing sky chilly aldehydes countered warm cedar dry clarifying scent hinoki prized cypress grows japan hinoki wood used make finest soaking baths distinctive incense like scent airy haunting first impression cool clean simple spend time would strike word simple ultramodern blend citrus wood enough strangeness make utterly compelling,"lime, yuzu, thyme flower, aldehyde, hinoki, cedar wood, musk"
Rouge Assassin,Jovoy Paris,"Two types of women from the Twenties mingle in the same space without ever really meeting: One is 'la maitresse de ces messieurs', a mistress in the tradition of the Second Empire and the 'garconne', a term for the emancipated woman, whose look may have been androgynous at times, but who Rouge Assassin pays tribute to those fearless, unstoppable women who upended the established order and broke all the rules. While the gareÂonne look is sometimes considered masculine, femininity is what came through in the way women wore their hair and makeup, in their attitudes, their hunger for freedom and the insatiable desire to love without regard for social codes and conventions. She was the first in the history of women's fashion to reveal her legs. Soon, brassieres would replace corsets. Thick stockings vanished in favor of silk ones worn rolled over a garter above the knee. It was at this time that the first lipsticks appeared.
The scent opens with the mysterious quality of both women's scents intermingling - sweet cigar smoke swirls and twirls in the dim light until it collides with a seductive cloud of powder. Everything is in silhouette as the scent draws you in to explore its development - the lipstick iris and saturated rose notes give way to a plush cushion of ambrette, vanilla, and benzoin. The cedar note lends a kick of smoke that evokes a bewitching image - a pair of glossy red lips smoking a clove cigarette.
Thanks to the collaboration of perfumer Amelie Bourgeois, Rouge Assassin is an homage to femininity that blends lipstick notes (iris butter), with the scent of skin (rice bran, musk, powdery floral accords) and echoes of Parisian cabarets. Men who wear it are either incurable risk-takers or they are Machiavellian schemers.","bergamot, fresh rose, elemi, solar accord, iris, rice bran, ambrette seed, cedar, white musk, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61608.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,two types women twenties mingle space without ever really meeting one 'la maitresse de ces messieurs' mistress tradition second empire 'garconne' term emancipated woman whose look may androgynous times rouge assassin pays tribute fearless unstoppable women upended established order broke rules gare onne look sometimes considered masculine femininity came way women wore hair makeup attitudes hunger freedom insatiable desire love without regard social codes conventions first history women's fashion reveal legs soon brassieres would replace corsets thick stockings vanished favor silk ones worn rolled garter knee time first lipsticks appeared scent opens mysterious quality women's scents intermingling sweet cigar smoke swirls twirls dim light collides seductive cloud powder everything silhouette scent draws explore development lipstick iris saturated rose notes give way plush cushion ambrette vanilla benzoin cedar note lends kick smoke evokes bewitching image pair glossy red lips smoking clove cigarette thanks collaboration perfumer amelie bourgeois rouge assassin homage femininity blends lipstick notes iris butter scent skin rice bran musk powdery floral accords echoes parisian cabarets men wear either incurable risk takers machiavellian schemers,"bergamot, fresh rose, elemi, solar accord, iris, rice bran, ambrette seed, cedar, white musk, sandalwood, vanilla, tonka bean, benzoin"
Knize Forest Eau de Toilette,Knize,"Knize Forest is green and at the same time soft and balmy. It has a contingent of bergamot. The heart is aromatic, spicy and a little woody on a base of ambergris and musk. Memories of the wide, green grassland of Ireland awaken in us.
Knize was founded in Vienna in 1858. After the death of founder Joseph Knize in 1880, his son Joseph Knize Jun took over the business. In 1888 Knize received the coveted title of royal tailor to the Austro-Hungarian Court.

Champaca Eau de Toilette,Comme des Garcons: Luxe,"If heaven had a fragrance, we think it would smell like Champaca. Named after the flower sacred to the Indus Valley, Champaca is a creamy and sweet floral that strikes perfect harmony between flower, perfumed wood and muted spice. It's absolutely stunning and its velvety beauty truly makes us think of something wild and natural, a perfume that seems almost impossible to have been blended by a mere human. Although the other notes in this perfume dance in and out, the holy champaca flower is and remains the exotic star of the perfume throughout, an endless dance of sweet, a soothing embrace of softness, and an otherworldly touch of something very, very rare. The champaca flower forms one of the five flower arrows of Kamadeva, the Hindu god of love known in the Western world as Cupid.

Acqua Decima Eau de Toilette,Eau d'Italie,"Acqua Decima, as its name indicates in Italian, is the tenth fragrance in the Eau d'Italie collection. Born nearly ten years ago as a celebration of Hotel Le Sirenuse's 50th anniversary, Eau d'Italie has become a collection of fragrances that evokes Italy's many seductive faces: not only summer in Positano, but also the roses of Paestum, winter in Tuscany and Umbria, the spirit of Venice, magnolias in Rome, a garden in Sicily, Capri and la dolce vita on the Amalfi coast.
Now Acqua Decima celebrates the spirit of Italy itself, with quintessentially Mediterranean sensations like the scented notes that greet us along The Path of the Gods, the spectacular mountain walk that links the Amalfi coast with the Bay of Sorrento, through cliffs in the wilderness over a glimmering blue sea. The gold of lemons and mandarins, the warmth of Neroli, the fresh coolness of petitgrain, enlivened by zesty notes of mint leaves. The result is a fragrance which from the very first notes inevitably brings a smile to one's face and the immediate good mood we feel when we recognize classic notes we love. Acqua Decima is the fragrance that reflects the sunniest feelings we have inside. Say hello to your perfect summer scent!","lemon, mandarine, mint leaves, neroli, petitgrain, hedione, white wood, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/43226.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,acqua decima name indicates italian tenth fragrance eau d'italie collection born nearly ten years ago celebration hotel le sirenuse's th anniversary eau d'italie become collection fragrances evokes italy's many seductive faces summer positano also roses paestum winter tuscany umbria spirit venice magnolias rome garden sicily capri la dolce vita amalfi coast acqua decima celebrates spirit italy quintessentially mediterranean sensations like scented notes greet us along path gods spectacular mountain walk links amalfi coast bay sorrento cliffs wilderness glimmering blue sea gold lemons mandarins warmth neroli fresh coolness petitgrain enlivened zesty notes mint leaves result fragrance first notes inevitably brings smile one's face immediate good mood feel recognize classic notes love acqua decima fragrance reflects sunniest feelings inside say hello perfect summer scent,"lemon, mandarine, mint leaves, neroli, petitgrain, hedione, white wood, vetiver"
Orangers en Fleurs Eau de Parfum,Houbigant,"The Orange Blossom is a symbol of fertility, of abundance â because Orange trees produce flowers and fruit at the same time â of innocence and marriage by excellence. It is also the emblem of love. It is an orange blossom note wrapped in a sophisticated perfume blend of Turkish rose absolute warmed by an animalistic note of Egyptian jasmine absolute.
The body is a subtle blend of tuberose and Eau de Brouts absolute, an exclusive Robertet raw material, surrounded by the Ylang Comores essence and slightly spiced by Nutmeg. A cedar wood blend with a touch of musk completes the composition.
Parfum Extract Luxe Edition Parfum Extracts are the ultimate form of a perfume, they are more sophisticated, long lasting, and every facet is in greater harmony.

Lys 41 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"A lavish, breathtaking, no-holds-barred big white floral that is drop-dead gorgeous. While the lily gets top billing, two other divas also share the center stage â jasmine and tuberose absolute. They make a grand entrance together, turning all the heads in the room â creamy tuberose, flirty jasmine and ravishing lily. We get the elegant and slightly spicy lily in the forefront, with her dazzling sisters close behind. But we should also note that on a blotter, it appears that the high pitched jasmine takes the lead and we have a friend who swears that, on her, the sweetness of the tuberose is more dominant; so the way this chord plays on your skin may vary somewhat. In any configuration, you get a profusion of glowing white petals -- a soaring mix of the heady qualities of all three blooms -- warmed with gentle woods and a dreamy, cozy vanilla. While this is definitely not light in the sense of being understated, it is light in the sense of being airy and buoyant. It is an expansive airiness - a large billowy cloud of something weightless: rows and rows of ballerinas spinning in tutus, hundreds of white butterflies being released into the air, an impossibly long chiffon veil floating in the wind. Lys 41 is also filled with light â the bright white flowers have a brilliant luminosity which is burnished to a soft pearlescent sheen by the musk and vanilla. The expectations are always high with Le Labo, and Lys 41, created in collaboration with one of Le Labo's iconic noses, Daphne Bugey, does not disappoint. They have created the white floral that we wear in our dreams.

Ylang 49 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"A sumptuous floral chypre with all the moody charisma of a film noir. Like the scarlet-lipped femme fatale with a shadowy past, the enigmatic Ylang 49 starts as a thing of straightforward beauty before leading us down a winding, slightly dangerous path.
Ylang 49 opens with a powerful burst of classic chypre elements â a sultry sweet floral heart of gardenia and ylang ylang, countering a pungently earthy patchouli and oakmoss. But just when you think you've got it figured out, the ylang ylang and gardenia meld into a lush, buttery, exotic floral with hints of apricot. The tension between the creamy flowers and dusky oakmoss creates a gingery fizz and the deep thrum of rich sandalwood and resinous benzoin generates a velvety sweetness that highlights the titular ingredient's peachlike aspect. In the center of all this swirling intrigue is a warm, salty skin note that feels both sensuous and modern, provocative yet comforting. Like the mysterious beauty from so many stories, Ylang 49 is not meant to flirt with everyone it meets, but instead to seduce only the worthy.
Exquisite secrets like the ones contained in Ylang 49 simply cannot be limited to either men or women. The only requirements are boldness, complexity, and a thirst for the extraordinary.

Rose 31 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"A rose for men destined to be stolen by women, Rose 31 takes the most feminine of all notes, darkens, dries and spicies it up turning it into a veritable emblem of masculinity. Mesmerizingly ambiguous, the fragrance alternates between the floral and the spicy with a generous dose of the woody and the animalic thrown in for good measure. The striking, elegantly austere beginning of Rose 31 gives way to the sweet, spicy star note of rose accompanied by fiery spices, pepper, clove and nutmeg. The naughty hint of cumin in the heart of the scent is a prologue to the sensual base of oud and vetiver. Dark, dangerous and sublimely refined, this is one of our favorite Rose perfumes of all time.

Glorious Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious,"Housed in Boadicea's signature falcon, is Glorious, a celebration of difference inspired by the warrior Queen and her unflinching determination to succeed. The desire was to create a non conventional fruity floral scent that would intrigue and bewitch the wearer.
Glorious surprises from the beginning with a hit of glossy, juicy accords loaded with playful mischief. Raspberry, plum and peach mingle on the skin with succulent delight, while apple and pineapple bring a sense of heavenly effervescence. As the fruity tones melt away, Glorious unravels like a fine wine, smooth and utterly divine. The heart of jasmine ensures the palpable feeling of luxury, while the use of cardamom and nutmeg convey the air of nonconformity that has become synonymous with Boadicea the Victorious.
The dry presents a moody, more mature sentient, emerging with warmth and charm. The amalgamation of precious woods, including, cedar wood, sandalwood and patchouli add to the mystique of the perfume. The lick of vanilla and whisper of amber demonstrates a luscious finish to an altogether intoxicating scent. Glorious demonstrates the perfect balance of refinement and innovation.","pineapple, plum, fresh, elemi, raspberry, peach, apple, cardamom, balsam, jasmine, nutmeg, rose, musk, cedar wood, amber, guaiac wood, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, mossy",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48519.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,housed boadicea's signature falcon glorious celebration difference inspired warrior queen unflinching determination succeed desire create non conventional fruity floral scent would intrigue bewitch wearer glorious surprises beginning hit glossy juicy accords loaded playful mischief raspberry plum peach mingle skin succulent delight apple pineapple bring sense heavenly effervescence fruity tones melt away glorious unravels like fine wine smooth utterly divine heart jasmine ensures palpable feeling luxury use cardamom nutmeg convey air nonconformity become synonymous boadicea victorious dry presents moody mature sentient emerging warmth charm amalgamation precious woods including cedar wood sandalwood patchouli add mystique perfume lick vanilla whisper amber demonstrates luscious finish altogether intoxicating scent glorious demonstrates perfect balance refinement innovation,"pineapple, plum, fresh, elemi, raspberry, peach, apple, cardamom, balsam, jasmine, nutmeg, rose, musk, cedar wood, amber, guaiac wood, patchouli, sandalwood, vanilla, mossy"
Mousse II Eau de Parfum,Oliver & Co.,"Oliver & Co.'s handcrafted fragrances are an intensely personal labor of love; created drop by drop to ensure that the end result is as spontaneous as it is satisfying. And while any other perfumer might be justifiably wary of tinkering with the unexpected balance of warm spice and cool musk that makes up the original MOUSSE, Oliver Valverde is not any other perfumer. The result is MOUSSE II, a thrilling reinvention that plays like a virtuosic take on a jazz standard, adding invigorating new depth to a familiar favorite. Like its predecessor, MOUSSE II opens with the spicy warmth of clove against a strong backbone of sandalwood and oak moss. But while the original took its time to slowly develop its cool aldehyde and musk counterbalance, MOUSSE II ups the ante with a powerful blast of mint that immediately ties spicy and fresh together. As the fragrance dries on the skin, notes of lily of the valley and Mexican lime weave together for a rich, bright green that blends vitality and lightness with the ever present warmth of clove without a hint of contradiction. Many fragrances claim to offer perfect balance, but very few manage to pull it off with such creative panache. With MOUSSE II, Oliver & Co. stands alone.

Oliver & Co.'s hypnotic Resina, on the other hand, transports the wearer not only to a different place, but also to a different time, a sultry and mystical forest of the ancients where the miraculous is commonplace, and beauty and wisdom are inextricably intertwined. Opening with an attention-catching burst of ginger and star anise, Resina quickly fills out with an opulent accord of precious woods and resins: tolu balsalm, elemi, frankincense, myrrh, labdanum. A subtle undercurrent of coffee and jasmine only furthers the sensation of exploring an earthy, mist-filled forest, brimming with ancestral knowledge. Spicy without a hint of stuffiness, rich and woody while not the least bit sweet, Resina reveals her secrets only to those who can prove themselves truly worthy.","tolu balsam, elemi, myrrh, labdanum, opopanax, frankincense somalia, benzoin , coffee co2 extract, jasmine sambac, fire tree, rooibos tincture, macis, tonka bean, fir balsam, ginger, star anise",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,say fragrance power transport implies strong sense place salty ocean lush forest flower filled meadow oliver co 's hypnotic resina hand transports wearer different place also different time sultry mystical forest ancients miraculous commonplace beauty wisdom inextricably intertwined opening attention catching burst ginger star anise resina quickly fills opulent accord precious woods resins tolu balsalm elemi frankincense myrrh labdanum subtle undercurrent coffee jasmine furthers sensation exploring earthy mist filled forest brimming ancestral knowledge spicy without hint stuffiness rich woody least bit sweet resina reveals secrets prove truly worthy,"tolu balsam, elemi, myrrh, labdanum, opopanax, frankincense somalia, benzoin , coffee co2 extract, jasmine sambac, fire tree, rooibos tincture, macis, tonka bean, fir balsam, ginger, star anise"
Vetiverus Eau de parfum,Oliver & Co.,"If you love the pure, smoky sexiness of vetiver the way we do, it can be frustrating to try fragrances that hide it behind other powerful ingredients in the name of 'balance.' Vetiverus most certainly does not have this problem. By selecting complementary notes that almost entirely accentuate and highlight the sweet earthiness of the namesake ingredient, Oliver & Co. have bucked tradition yet again with that rare vetiver fragrance that proudly refuses to apologize for being a vetiver. In keeping with this philosophy, Vetiverus opens dramatically with an exquisitely deep and mysterious vetiver, at once smoky and velvety rich, reminiscent of Les Nez's cult classic Turtle Vetiver Exercise 1. And rather than undercut that raw power, Vetiverus goes all in, with labdanum, leather, patchouli and clove serving to reinforce and extend the natural depth and warmth. A base of musk keeps everything standing upright, while the subtle sweetness of osmanthus flowers provides rich smoothness. Plenty of great fragrances feature vetiver. But for the true vetiver enthusiast searching for an unapologetic, uncompromising showcase of the sublimely smoky, there is perhaps no substitute for Vetiverus.","labdanum, styrax, vetiver, ambergris, osmanthus flower, orange peel, patchouli, musk, coriander seed, clove bud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57506.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,love pure smoky sexiness vetiver way frustrating try fragrances hide behind powerful ingredients name 'balance ' vetiverus certainly problem selecting complementary notes almost entirely accentuate highlight sweet earthiness namesake ingredient oliver co bucked tradition yet rare vetiver fragrance proudly refuses apologize vetiver keeping philosophy vetiverus opens dramatically exquisitely deep mysterious vetiver smoky velvety rich reminiscent les nez's cult classic turtle vetiver exercise rather undercut raw power vetiverus goes labdanum leather patchouli clove serving reinforce extend natural depth warmth base musk keeps everything standing upright subtle sweetness osmanthus flowers provides rich smoothness plenty great fragrances feature vetiver true vetiver enthusiast searching unapologetic uncompromising showcase sublimely smoky perhaps substitute vetiverus,"labdanum, styrax, vetiver, ambergris, osmanthus flower, orange peel, patchouli, musk, coriander seed, clove bud"

Bay Rum Cologne,Gilbert Henry,"This cologne is made with the same great essential oil blend as the corresponding Bay Rum aftershave balm, but at a higher concentration. This is a Bay Rum that lasts.

Les Jeux Sont Faits Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"In the 1960s, a particular kind of rogue flourished in French cinema, exemplified by actors Jean Gabin and Lino Ventura. Their natural habitat was the smoky gambling den, the atmosphere thick with vice and retro masculinity. With Jovoy's woody aromatic perfume Les Jeux Sont Faits ('The Bets Have Been Placed'), Francois Henin wanted to pay homage to those louche and romantic icons that marked an era. English gin clinking in a tumbler with ice â aromatic, fresh, and cold â is evoked by the astringent herb angelica as Les Jeux Sont Faits sounds its first notes. Its juniper-like sharpness gives way to accords that recall the woodwork, leather chairs, and gaming men in clandestine gambling clubs: tobacco leaves, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli and leather. To offset these olfactory signifiers of masculinity is a warm and fruity accord rounded off by vanilla and labdanum, which also recalls Old Cuban rums.
As it dries down, Les Jeux Sont Faits' balance of herby petitgrain, boozy accords, woods and spice warmed with vanillic notes makes for one sexy scent you can bet on: this one's a winner.","petitgrain, angelica, dried fruits, rum, gin, tobacco leaf, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61606.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,particular kind rogue flourished french cinema exemplified actors jean gabin lino ventura natural habitat smoky gambling den atmosphere thick vice retro masculinity jovoy's woody aromatic perfume les jeux sont faits 'the bets placed' francois henin wanted pay homage louche romantic icons marked era english gin clinking tumbler ice aromatic fresh cold evoked astringent herb angelica les jeux sont faits sounds first notes juniper like sharpness gives way accords recall woodwork leather chairs gaming men clandestine gambling clubs tobacco leaves cumin sandalwood patchouli leather offset olfactory signifiers masculinity warm fruity accord rounded vanilla labdanum also recalls old cuban rums dries les jeux sont faits' balance herby petitgrain boozy accords woods spice warmed vanillic notes makes one sexy scent bet one's winner,"petitgrain, angelica, dried fruits, rum, gin, tobacco leaf, cumin, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, labdanum"
Coal Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums,"Andrea Maack's Coal fragrance is based on one of her original drawings made with black coal.

Connoisseurs of leather scents will want to flock to this brooding yet seductive perfume. A vetiver leather dosed with patchouli and papyrus sedge, followed by a creamy, woodsy base, Private Label is bone dry and only lightly sweetened yet soft and seductive.

This formidable accord is balanced by the rich, buttery base of sandalwood and vanillic labdanum (cistus).

Psychedelique Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"Psychedelique, Jovoy's magnificent ambered patchouli, largely stays in the shadows, meditating on the synergies between a cocoa-like amber and an inky-dark patchouli, although rose and geranium offer a touch of freshness to its earthy sexiness.
The synaesthete might say that on the olfactory color wheel, patchouli resides somewhere between black and chocolate brown, with a bit of iridescent chartreuse green shimmering in between. Camphory, inky, aromatic, and even darkly refreshing, the elegant patchouli in Psychedelique is 'dark, smoky, ambered, generous and opulent, ' says Franecois Henin, and in spite of its unfortunate branding given by unwashed hippies 1960s, he says of this perfume that 'Even the mud of Woodstock won't wash it away.'
Psychedelique is like an olfactory Mark Rothko painting that explores the gradations between dark colors â in this case, patchouli, amber, and musk. Darkly seductive and even comforting, you might even call it 50 Shades of Black.","citrus, rose, geranium, amber, patchouli, cistus labdanum, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61605.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,psychedelique jovoy's magnificent ambered patchouli largely stays shadows meditating synergies cocoa like amber inky dark patchouli although rose geranium offer touch freshness earthy sexiness synaesthete might say olfactory color wheel patchouli resides somewhere black chocolate brown bit iridescent chartreuse green shimmering camphory inky aromatic even darkly refreshing elegant patchouli psychedelique 'dark smoky ambered generous opulent ' says franecois henin spite unfortunate branding given unwashed hippies says perfume 'even mud woodstock wash away ' psychedelique like olfactory mark rothko painting explores gradations dark colors case patchouli amber musk darkly seductive even comforting might even call shades black,"citrus, rose, geranium, amber, patchouli, cistus labdanum, vanilla, musk"
Ambre Premier Eau de Parfum,Jovoy Paris,"An amber perfume with an edge, Ambre Premier gets a dark and glittering dose of patchouli added to what Franecois Henin calls â its almost childish first notes that evoke cotton candy, ' and maybe even a bit of chocolate.

Flash Back Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"Straying ever-so-slightly from the brand's concept, the fragrance takes its name from film rather than photography. But then 'flashback' makes sense at every level. The picture that inspired it, a dream-like screen capture of a video shot by Laurent Segretier, is the face of his long-distance girlfriend (a print of the image is included in the box). The perfumer who composed it, Olivier Cresp, had worked with the brand owner Celine Verleure back in 1996 on L'Eau par Kenzo for women and for men, in her previous life as a top-flight project manager in the perfume industry. As for the scent, it is Olivier Cresp's own version of a flashback, a childhood memory he'd long wanted to use as a springboard for inspiration: rhubarb pie.
But though the master perfumer pegs himself as 'figurative', don't expect a photorealistic impression of the homemade dessert. Flashback plays on the tart, green, citrusy aspects of rhubarb. Once unfolded, these facets connect with a bright, joyful vetiver whose grapefruit-like top notes are enhanced by actual grapefruit, before whispering the barest hint of flint and smoke.
As luminous as a late spring afternoon in Cresp's native Grasse, as exhilarating as remembering a loved one's face. After all, isn't the charm of fragrance the way it materializes our memories?","rhubarb, grapefruit, orange, pink pepper, granny smith apple, vetiver, cedar, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,straying ever slightly brand's concept fragrance takes name film rather photography 'flashback' makes sense every level picture inspired dream like screen capture video shot laurent segretier face long distance girlfriend print image included box perfumer composed olivier cresp worked brand owner celine verleure back l'eau par kenzo women men previous life top flight project manager perfume industry scent olivier cresp's version flashback childhood memory he'd long wanted use springboard inspiration rhubarb pie though master perfumer pegs 'figurative' expect photorealistic impression homemade dessert flashback plays tart green citrusy aspects rhubarb unfolded facets connect bright joyful vetiver whose grapefruit like top notes enhanced actual grapefruit whispering barest hint flint smoke luminous late spring afternoon cresp's native grasse exhilarating remembering loved one's face charm fragrance way materializes memories,"rhubarb, grapefruit, orange, pink pepper, granny smith apple, vetiver, cedar, amber, musk"
Lumiere Blanche Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"Picture a chalk cliff looming over a sea as still and metallic as mercury under a blazing sun... This is the picture selected by the renowned Italian photographer Massimo Vitali â whose work has been exhibited in major museums like the Guggenheim â as a brief for Lumiere Blanche (i.e. 'white light').
To translate this concept of whiteness, but also the heat of the sun and the coolness of the sea, Sidonie Lancesseur has similarly played on olfactory contrasts. Coolness? A brace of cold spices like cardamom and star anise. Heat? The burn of cinnamon. This spicy cocktail livens up a soothing, creamy blend of almond milk, sandalwood and tonka bean: the almond and sandalwood produce skin-loving milky effects, while the almond and tonka bean pick up on the licorice-y facets of the star anise. Powdery iris and musks add another, different layer of whiteness to a fragrance which, unusually, has a slightly milky aspect. A beautiful, sensuous yet candid fragrance that might just turn into your go-to bottle.","cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, iris, almond milk, cashmere wood, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61501.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,picture chalk cliff looming sea still metallic mercury blazing sun picture selected renowned italian photographer massimo vitali whose work exhibited major museums like guggenheim brief lumiere blanche e 'white light' translate concept whiteness also heat sun coolness sea sidonie lancesseur similarly played olfactory contrasts coolness brace cold spices like cardamom star anise heat burn cinnamon spicy cocktail livens soothing creamy blend almond milk sandalwood tonka bean almond sandalwood produce skin loving milky effects almond tonka bean pick licorice facets star anise powdery iris musks add another different layer whiteness fragrance unusually slightly milky aspect beautiful sensuous yet candid fragrance might turn go bottle,"cardamom, star anise, cinnamon, iris, almond milk, cashmere wood, cedar, sandalwood, tonka bean, white musk"
Autoportrait Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"You'd think a photographer asked for a self-portrait would supply his likeness. Yet when Celine Verleure, the owner of Olfactive Studio, reached out to Luc Lapetre for a photographic fragrance brief, he offered a dream-like skyscape where a tiny, solitary figure walks under what looks like the sky reflected in a pool of water.
To translate this meditative image into scent, the great Nathalie Lorson based her composition on age-old sacred resins: benzoin and incense. Autoportrait is a quiet, serene blend with a perfect balance of dry woodiness and soothing cuddliness (supplied by the milky vanilla facets of benzoin). Amazingly addictive yet deeply soulful, this seemingly simple scent keeps unfurling subtle facets, like ripples expanding on the surface of a lake.","bergamot, elemi, benzoin, incense, musk, oak moss, cedar, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61502.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,think photographer asked self portrait would supply likeness yet celine verleure owner olfactive studio reached luc lapetre photographic fragrance brief offered dream like skyscape tiny solitary figure walks looks like sky reflected pool water translate meditative image scent great nathalie lorson based composition age old sacred resins benzoin incense autoportrait quiet serene blend perfect balance dry woodiness soothing cuddliness supplied milky vanilla facets benzoin amazingly addictive yet deeply soulful seemingly simple scent keeps unfurling subtle facets like ripples expanding surface lake,"bergamot, elemi, benzoin, incense, musk, oak moss, cedar, vetiver"
Chambre Noire Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"The dark room envisioned by Clemence Rene-Bazin, an alumnus of the fabled Magnum agency, is in a hotel in Cairo with a view of the Nile, the modern city on the opposite bank rising in stark contrast with the antiquity of the legendary river...
Dorothee Piot's olfactive rendition of this image also draws on a contemporary vibe to express age-old ingredients. In fact, vintage fragrance lovers might well be delighted with this full-bodied blend: with its boozy, plummy notes, violet, patchouli and leather, Chambre Noire drops more than a hint of an old-school chypre. As though you'd smelled the sillage of Femme in a temple where incense had been burning. After all, ancient Egyptians did consider that perfume was the sweat of the gods. All the more reason to treat yourself to this divine fragrance, as sensuous and mysterious as a hotel room in an exotic city â or as the innermost chamber of a temple dedicated to beauty.","pink pepper, jasmine, papyrus (cypriol), violet, incense, prune, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, vanilla, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/61503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,dark room envisioned clemence rene bazin alumnus fabled magnum agency hotel cairo view nile modern city opposite bank rising stark contrast antiquity legendary river dorothee piot's olfactive rendition image also draws contemporary vibe express age old ingredients fact vintage fragrance lovers might well delighted full bodied blend boozy plummy notes violet patchouli leather chambre noire drops hint old school chypre though smelled sillage femme temple incense burning ancient egyptians consider perfume sweat gods reason treat divine fragrance sensuous mysterious hotel room exotic city innermost chamber temple dedicated beauty,"pink pepper, jasmine, papyrus (cypriol), violet, incense, prune, sandalwood, patchouli, musk, vanilla, leather"
Still Life Eau de Parfum,Olfactive Studio,"Despite its name, drawn like all the Olfactive Studio fragrances from the vocabulary of photography, this life is anything but still. It's more like the life of the party! Inspired by Frederic Lebain's playful picture of mirror balls, party streamers and confetti (a print is included in the box), the young, up-and-coming perfumer Dora Arnaud has concocted a sparkling cocktail. Playing on the natural affinities of citrus and pepper â they share lemon-y facets --, she livens up the flavorful Japanese yuzu fruit with a blend of three peppers including the rare and precious Sichuan pepper, for a stunningly original cool-hot contrast. Dark rum turns up the heat in the base notes, anchored with dry, woody facets.
This fiery, fizzy cocktail is just begging to be translated into a drink, but as a stunningly original new take on citrus, it's also a fabulous 'energy drink' for your nose!

Labdanum 18 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"The most enigmatic and sensual and, unexpectedly, the most comforting in the Le Labo collection, Labdanum 18, composed by one of our favorite perfumers, Maurice Roucel, is a modern oriental masterpiece.

Flower of Immortality Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"With Flower of Immortality, Kilian pays homage to the Chinese tale 'A Tale of the Fountain of the Peach Blossom Spring'. It is recounted that a fisherman from Wu Ling loses his way along a stream and, unexpectedly, finds himself rowing alongside a lush peach tree forest. He decides to explore further and, at the end of the forest, lands at the fountainhead of the stream. There, he disembarks and just steps beyond, discovers a haven of peace, a utopian paradise where people live apart from the exterior world. For Kilian, Flower of Immortality is, above all, an olfactory homage to the peach blossom and its very strong symbolism in China. This blossom, whose pink petals are unveiled only in the middle of the winter, is believed to have the power to bewitch the human soul and to make it immortal. It is the set of symbols and myths that surround the flower that Kilian wanted to recreate in this new fragrance.
Flower of Immortality was composed as the memory of the utopian paradise, where the fragrance of peach blossoms brings a promise of hospitality and immortality. The smooth and juicy scent of White Peach, interweaved by the sweet and powdery notes of Carrot and Iris. A dazzling breeze of Blackcurrant Bud absolute refreshes while the exquisite Rose Crystal is softened by the Tonka Bean and the scent of Vanilla beans drying in the sun.","white peach, blackcurrant bud, freesia, iris, rose crystal, vanilla, tonka bean, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42568.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,flower immortality kilian pays homage chinese tale 'a tale fountain peach blossom spring' recounted fisherman wu ling loses way along stream unexpectedly finds rowing alongside lush peach tree forest decides explore end forest lands fountainhead stream disembarks steps beyond discovers peace utopian paradise people live apart exterior world kilian flower immortality olfactory homage peach blossom strong symbolism china blossom whose pink petals unveiled middle winter believed power bewitch human soul make immortal set symbols myths surround flower kilian wanted recreate new fragrance flower immortality composed memory utopian paradise fragrance peach blossoms brings promise hospitality immortality smooth juicy scent white peach interweaved sweet powdery notes carrot iris dazzling breeze blackcurrant bud absolute refreshes exquisite rose crystal softened tonka bean scent vanilla beans drying sun,"white peach, blackcurrant bud, freesia, iris, rose crystal, vanilla, tonka bean, white musk"
Oud 27 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"The first new worldwide fragrance since Le Labo was created, Oud 27 uses its title note as a point of departure into the richly ornamented, dark and luscious world of oriental perfumes, weaving a story so multi-faceted and vivid that it might be an olfactory equivalent of one of Scheherazade's tales. The vibrant darkness falls with the very first accord, an extravagantly opulent mix of Atlas cedar and incense. The dry, resinous blend is brightened and softly sweetened by saffron, the golden spiciness of which glistens within the nocturnal fabric of Oud 27 like a constellation of far away stars. Gaiac and patchouli further deepen and enrich the balsamic top notes and lead the scent into an even more sensual territory. At once expansive and wild, yet surprisingly intimate and soft, the scent is beautifully androgynous and would befit both Scheherazade and Shahryar. The creators call Oud 27, One Thousand and One Nights, bottled. We are so mesmerized by this oriental masterpiece that we would wear it for one thousand and one nights in a row and not miss another perfume.","cedar, incense, patchouli, saffron, gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46802.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first new worldwide fragrance since le labo created oud uses title note point departure richly ornamented dark luscious world oriental perfumes weaving story multi faceted vivid might olfactory equivalent one scheherazade's tales vibrant darkness falls first accord extravagantly opulent mix atlas cedar incense dry resinous blend brightened softly sweetened saffron golden spiciness glistens within nocturnal fabric oud like constellation far away stars gaiac patchouli deepen enrich balsamic top notes lead scent even sensual territory expansive wild yet surprisingly intimate soft scent beautifully androgynous would befit scheherazade shahryar creators call oud one thousand one nights bottled mesmerized oriental masterpiece would wear one thousand one nights row miss another perfume,"cedar, incense, patchouli, saffron, gaiac wood"

Patchouli 24 Eau de Parfum,Le Labo,"Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again. If you want straight patchouli, look elsewhere. If you are open to a fragrance that embraces the idea of patchouli, and yet is like nothing you've smelled before, welcome to Patchouli 24.","patchouli, birch tar, styrax, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46806.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,le labo known playing ideas fragrance patchouli exception patchouli talented perfumer annick menardo takes idea patchouli rebellious adventurer creative streak spins scent upsets expectations instead smelling like patchouli know patchouli intensely leathery smoky like worn leather jacket laid hot motorcycle engine counterbalanced notes creamy custard like vanilla patchouli 's contradictions draw us back wrists smell want straight patchouli look elsewhere open fragrance embraces idea patchouli yet like nothing smelled welcome patchouli,"patchouli, birch tar, styrax, vanilla"
Aurore Nomade Eau de Parfum,The Different Company,"Bertrand Duchaufour's third composition for The Different Company's Collection Excessive started out with what he dubs a 'Sinbad accord': star fruit on a tree in the sun, with apricot-y freesia accents and a touch of juicy, melon-y green... Topped off with a flash of aged rum, this 'Nomadic Dawn' could well be the name of a tropical cocktail sipped in a banana grove â the 'banana flower' accord conjured with ylang-ylang â while plumerias waft in the distance...
The burn of the rum and spices, bolstered with davana and immortelle, creates a sharp contrast with the thirst-quenching coolness of the fruity-aquatic notes. But this is no chichi, fancy-resort drink: picture Robert Mitchum handing it to Jane Russell in a sarong with a deep-pitched growl. Tough yet sophisticated tropicalia, and pretty much the next best thing to living it up on a Pacific Island.","banana flower, star fruit accords, cinnamon, aquatic notes, nutmeg, rum, davana, ylang-ylang, geranium, clove, plumeria, indole, immortelle absolute, sandalwood, amber, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25326.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,bertrand duchaufour's third composition different company's collection excessive started dubs 'sinbad accord' star fruit tree sun apricot freesia accents touch juicy melon green topped flash aged rum 'nomadic dawn' could well name tropical cocktail sipped banana grove 'banana flower' accord conjured ylang ylang plumerias waft distance burn rum spices bolstered davana immortelle creates sharp contrast thirst quenching coolness fruity aquatic notes chichi fancy resort drink picture robert mitchum handing jane russell sarong deep pitched growl tough yet sophisticated tropicalia pretty much next best thing living pacific island,"banana flower, star fruit accords, cinnamon, aquatic notes, nutmeg, rum, davana, ylang-ylang, geranium, clove, plumeria, indole, immortelle absolute, sandalwood, amber, vanilla, musk"
La Fille de Berlin Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"The Girl from Berlin' is Serge Lutens's third tribute to the rose, and his second to the divas of yesteryear after the Palais Royal exclusive Une Voix Noire, inspired by Billie Holliday... This time, the model remains unnamed, but she is obviously a creature of the decadent 1920s in Berlin: a sleek-legged, smoky-eyed femme fatale. Louise Brooks as the amoral Lulu in Pandora's Box, a pre-Hollywood Marlene Dietrich crooning 'Men cluster to me like moths around a flame' in The Blue Angel... And how couldn't they? This angel is not blue, but as red as the petals of a blood-gorged rose. Here, the flower is expressed at its richest: you can almost taste its jamminess, lifted with metallic hints of pink and black pepper. But its velvety flesh is also a woman's, musky, honeyed and dark.
A riveting, take-no-prisoners sillage monster, La Fille de Berlin is Lutens at the top of his flamboyant form. So femme a man could rock it. So true to the flower no rose lover should be without it. So good it could even convert the rose-averse. Falling in love again, never wanted to... What I am to do?

La Route d'Emeraude Eau de Parfum,Isabey,"""La Route d'Emeraude"" is inspired, with a touch of nostalgia, by the journey leading to the Emerald Triangle (Thailand, Laos and Cambodia), filled with the scents of Jasmine Sambac and blooming flowers. Many Orient lovers took the path to these faraway lands and experimented sensations that are recaptured in this edition of the mythical perfume. Created in 1924, La Route d'Emeraude was designed by Julien Viard, in a faceted bottle and a jewel-like case, reminiscent of the splendor of the Far East.

Enchanted Forest Eau de Parfum,The Vagabond Prince,"Enchanted Forest is inspired by the endless sea of Russian forests and fairytales, as well as the most sensual ancient Slavic celebration named Kupala, rooted in the times of darkness, when all on the Earth knew its soul and its name (often too powerful to be uttered in vain or at all). French perfumer Bertrand Duchaufour, the famous creator of fragrances for L'Artisan Parfumeur, Comme des Garcons and Penhaligon's, built Enchanted Forest around black currant, the smell and taste of which are so beloved in Russia and many other countries where it grows.
'The challenge was great: I had to magnify the raw material (blackcurrant), a material used very often in perfumery and sometimes overused inelegantly through notes of red fruits, and in this regard I made a sort of soliflore. Soliflores are generally constructed on floral bases such as jasmine, rose, tuberose, but for Enchanted Forest the intention was quite different... and I had the idea of working the blackcurrant throughout the structure (head, heart, bottom) of the perfume. To do this, I used no less than a blackcurrant CO2 (an extract obtained directly from the blackcurrant buds, which is free of solvent residues), an absolute of blackcurrant and two different blackcurrant bases, including one of my own creation, to build a sort of skeleton, a vertical structure on which the entire perfume would be built.' â Bertrand Duchaufour","pink pepper, aldehydes, sweet orange, flower cassis, blackcurrant leaf, hawthorn, rum, wine, rosemary, davana, blackcurrant buds absolute, co2 blackcurrant, russian coriander seed, honeysuckle, rose, carnation, vetiverm, opoponax, benzoin, amber, oakmoss, fir balsam absolute, patchouli, castoreum, cedar notes, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/60000.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,enchanted forest inspired endless sea russian forests fairytales well sensual ancient slavic celebration named kupala rooted times darkness earth knew soul name often powerful uttered vain french perfumer bertrand duchaufour famous creator fragrances l'artisan parfumeur comme des garcons penhaligon's built enchanted forest around black currant smell taste beloved russia many countries grows 'the challenge great magnify raw material blackcurrant material used often perfumery sometimes overused inelegantly notes red fruits regard made sort soliflore soliflores generally constructed floral bases jasmine rose tuberose enchanted forest intention quite different idea working blackcurrant throughout structure head heart bottom perfume used less blackcurrant co extract obtained directly blackcurrant buds free solvent residues absolute blackcurrant two different blackcurrant bases including one creation build sort skeleton vertical structure entire perfume would built ' bertrand duchaufour,"pink pepper, aldehydes, sweet orange, flower cassis, blackcurrant leaf, hawthorn, rum, wine, rosemary, davana, blackcurrant buds absolute, co2 blackcurrant, russian coriander seed, honeysuckle, rose, carnation, vetiverm, opoponax, benzoin, amber, oakmoss, fir balsam absolute, patchouli, castoreum, cedar notes, vanilla, musk"
Nero Perfume Oil,Bruno Acampora,"Intense and provocative. Nero is a take-no-prisoners woody oriental that mesmerizes and fascinates. It opens with citrus, but the moment of sunshine is fleeting as we enter a dark labyrinth of bittersweet saffron, bold cedar and hypnotic patchouli. The combination is dizzying â almost narcotic in nature â and we are led to an opulent lair filled with honeyed amber, burnished sandalwood and a deeply sensuous musk. Clearly, someone is up to no good. And if you are wearing this fragrance, it is probably you. As you would expect from Bruno Acampora, the musk note is incredible, and its warm, melting-into-the-skin quality keeps Nero smooth and balanced, and lets the darker elements frolic without running rampant over the entire composition. This means we can enjoy the risque decadence of cedar and saffron while still being perfectly welcome in polite society. In fact, we're fairly certain that if we were wearing this addictive blend, we would be welcome anywhere.","citrus, saffron, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/37529.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,intense provocative nero take prisoners woody oriental mesmerizes fascinates opens citrus moment sunshine fleeting enter dark labyrinth bittersweet saffron bold cedar hypnotic patchouli combination dizzying almost narcotic nature led opulent lair filled honeyed amber burnished sandalwood deeply sensuous musk clearly someone good wearing fragrance probably would expect bruno acampora musk note incredible warm melting skin quality keeps nero smooth balanced lets darker elements frolic without running rampant entire composition means enjoy risque decadence cedar saffron still perfectly welcome polite society fact we're fairly certain wearing addictive blend would welcome anywhere,"citrus, saffron, cedar, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, musk"

Rosae Mundi Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Sometimes a rose fragrance can take a quiet and docile path, blushing and giggling with an innocent and soapy freshness. Classic and traditional - she's a safe bet and a loyal friend. Rosae Mundi is not that rose fragrance, and prefers not to show up to her boring parties. If she did decide to show, she'd kick down the door in a low cut dress and demand a man and a martini.
Beginning with a tinge of berry sweetness that draws you in before it's too late, Rosae Mundi is a luscious and uncompromising beauty. She brings to the imagination a spontaneous trip to Venice and a night sloshed with wine and wilting roses. Rosae Mundi, or Rose of the World, is a compilation of rose and earth - vetiver, patchouli, and cedar lend the rich and downy chaise upon which the divine rose curls. As the scent develops, these earthly pleasures divulge their secrets on the skin - complimenting one another beautifully. It seems as though this rose has been everywhere and seen everything, and yet still rises (though not too early, let's not push it) with a curiosity and eagerness to see what the new day holds.","rose, patchouli, vetiver, cedar",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33936.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sometimes rose fragrance take quiet docile path blushing giggling innocent soapy freshness classic traditional safe bet loyal friend rosae mundi rose fragrance prefers show boring parties decide show she'd kick door low cut dress demand man martini beginning tinge berry sweetness draws late rosae mundi luscious uncompromising beauty brings imagination spontaneous trip venice night sloshed wine wilting roses rosae mundi rose world compilation rose earth vetiver patchouli cedar lend rich downy chaise upon divine rose curls scent develops earthly pleasures divulge secrets skin complimenting one another beautifully seems though rose everywhere seen everything yet still rises though early let's push curiosity eagerness see new day holds,"rose, patchouli, vetiver, cedar"

Opardu Extrait de Parfum,Puredistance,"Oh to be a madcap heiress, sliding through the crowd in a biasâcut satin gown and glittering pumps, a champagne cocktail in one hand and a leash leading to some exotic pet in the other. Your brows are perpetually arched as you scan the crowd for a dashing aviator or an adorably bookish professor to seduce. What scent are you wearing? Opardu, of course! Well, historically speaking, you wouldn't be - but in the glorious art deco movie set of our minds, you are. Because Opardu is not about the past, it is about a fantasy of the past, just like our daydreams. It evokes the enchantment and glamour of a bygone era, but still feels modern. The opening is especially evocative of another time and it is pure swank â like an expensive gift from a rich suitor, conjuring up images of mirror-topped vanities and red lipstick. This develops into an opulent floral featuring luminous gardenia, heady tuberose, piercing jasmine, and velvety rose. The mix is full and lush and there is the seductive thrum of cedar wood underneath it all. You might guess that the lilac and heliotrope would be overwhelmed by all of this and just sit off to the side and whisper to each other â but they are beautifully present, adding delicacy and charm as they put the twinkle in our saucy heroine's eye. As the scent wears on, the more ethereal elements continue to shine and the overall effect is absolutely lovely. Another beautiful scent created by Annie Buzantian for Puredistance.","tuberose absolute, gardenia, rose, purple lilac, carnation, jasmine absolute, heliotrope, cedar wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,oh madcap heiress sliding crowd bias cut satin gown glittering pumps champagne cocktail one hand leash leading exotic pet brows perpetually arched scan crowd dashing aviator adorably bookish professor seduce scent wearing opardu course well historically speaking glorious art deco movie set minds opardu past fantasy past like daydreams evokes enchantment glamour bygone era still feels modern opening especially evocative another time pure swank like expensive gift rich suitor conjuring images mirror topped vanities red lipstick develops opulent floral featuring luminous gardenia heady tuberose piercing jasmine velvety rose mix full lush seductive thrum cedar wood underneath might guess lilac heliotrope would overwhelmed sit side whisper beautifully present adding delicacy charm put twinkle saucy heroine's eye scent wears ethereal elements continue shine overall effect absolutely lovely another beautiful scent created annie buzantian puredistance,"tuberose absolute, gardenia, rose, purple lilac, carnation, jasmine absolute, heliotrope, cedar wood"

Do you remember the old Marlboro ads? A man and his horse in front of the fire on a great plain under tall, blue evening skies - A defining image of the spirit of the American West with all it implied about masculinity and personal freedom.

Small and convenient for traveling or purse. Use it on your pulse points, on your hair, your beard. The oil scent keeps close to the skin for a long lasting effect. Bergamote 22 started its life under the code nameâÂFire Cologne', and as soon as we smelled the unexpected effervescent spiciness of its top notes, we knew why. Subtle but noticeable, the piquancy of nutmeg puts a twist on the classic citrus scent genre. The tingling spice compliments beautifully the fizzy notes of grapefruit and bergamot. The translucent green aspect brought on by petit grain is yet another layer that unfolds on the skin revealing the complex nature of this seemingly simple composition. The gauzy citrus notes are grounded by amber, musk and vetiver. The substantionality of the base notes gives Bergamote 22 weight and rich texture seldom found in citrus blends.

Le Labo is known for playing with our ideas of what a fragrance should be, and Patchouli 24 is no exception. With Patchouli 24, talented perfumer Annick Menardo takes the idea of patchouli-- a rebellious adventurer with a creative streak-- and spins it into a scent that upsets all expectations. Instead of smelling like the patchouli we know, Patchouli 24 is intensely leathery and smoky, like a worn leather jacket laid over a hot motorcycle engine. Counterbalanced against these notes is a creamy, custard-like vanilla. Patchouli 24's contradictions draw us back to our wrists to smell it again and again.

The first new worldwide fragrance since Le Labo was created, Oud 27 uses its title note as a point of departure into the richly ornamented, dark and luscious world of oriental perfumes, weaving a story so multi-faceted and vivid that it might be an olfactory equivalent of one of Scheherazade's tales. The vibrant darkness falls with the very first accord, an extravagantly opulent mix of Atlas cedar and incense. The dry, resinous blend is brightened and softly sweetened by saffron, the golden spiciness of which glistens within the nocturnal fabric of Oud 27 like a constellation of far away stars. Gaiac and patchouli further deepen and enrich the balsamic top notes and lead the scent into an even more sensual territory. At once expansive and wild, yet surprisingly intimate and soft, the scent is beautifully androgynous and would befit both Scheherazade and Shahryar. The creators call Oud 27, One Thousand and One Nights, bottled. We are so mesmerized by this oriental masterpiece that we would wear it for one thousand and one nights in a row and not miss another perfume.","cedar, incense, patchouli, saffron, gaiac wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/46835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,captured perfume oil ideal sensitive skin people love hedonic gesture delicate persistent smell small convenient traveling purse use pulse points hair beard oil scent keeps close skin long lasting effect first new worldwide fragrance since le labo created oud uses title note point departure richly ornamented dark luscious world oriental perfumes weaving story multi faceted vivid might olfactory equivalent one scheherazade's tales vibrant darkness falls first accord extravagantly opulent mix atlas cedar incense dry resinous blend brightened softly sweetened saffron golden spiciness glistens within nocturnal fabric oud like constellation far away stars gaiac patchouli deepen enrich balsamic top notes lead scent even sensual territory expansive wild yet surprisingly intimate soft scent beautifully androgynous would befit scheherazade shahryar creators call oud one thousand one nights bottled mesmerized oriental masterpiece would wear one thousand one nights row miss another perfume,"cedar, incense, patchouli, saffron, gaiac wood"

Tzora Eau de Parfum,Anat Fritz,"Berlin-based designer Anat Fritz enlisted the help of master perfumer Geza Schoen to design the second fragrance in her collection. Tzora takes its name from the Israeli kibbutz Anat frequents in the summertime. Known to be the biblical home of Samson and Delilah, Tzora boasts a landscape saturated with lemon, olive and pomegranate trees. The scents of the earth, plants and sky combine to create a distinctive, multi-faceted fragrance.
Tzora begins its journey with a slightly sweet blast of sun-ripened orange. The citric effervescence immediately ushers in a nose-tingling pinch of pepper. The mineral notes of warm earth and moss ground Tzora and in so doing, nudge the fragrance into the chypre style. The shadow of tall cypress trees offers an evergreen filter to the blend. Subtle traces of vetiver carry Tzora into its rugged yet comforting dry-down.
Tzora celebrates the union of man with earth. Equally at home in the boardroom, mountain hike or fine restaurant, Tzora bears the hallmarks of a modern classic in the making.","cassis, clary, bergamot, peruvian pepper, magnolia, osmanthus, jasmine, cedarwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, moss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35001.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,berlin based designer anat fritz enlisted help master perfumer geza schoen design second fragrance collection tzora takes name israeli kibbutz anat frequents summertime known biblical home samson delilah tzora boasts landscape saturated lemon olive pomegranate trees scents earth plants sky combine create distinctive multi faceted fragrance tzora begins journey slightly sweet blast sun ripened orange citric effervescence immediately ushers nose tingling pinch pepper mineral notes warm earth moss ground tzora nudge fragrance chypre style shadow tall cypress trees offers evergreen filter blend subtle traces vetiver carry tzora rugged yet comforting dry tzora celebrates union man earth equally home boardroom mountain hike fine restaurant tzora bears hallmarks modern classic making,"cassis, clary, bergamot, peruvian pepper, magnolia, osmanthus, jasmine, cedarwood, vetiver, patchouli, musk, moss"
Akkad Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Akkad is a luminous amber perfume, mystical but also sensual, a descent into the profane pleasures of ancient tyrants, an exhalation of sacred oils and precious spices.
Delphine Thierry, who composed this creation, imagined an amber note that is both spicy and luminous. The opposite therefore of the dark, mystical ambers that bring to mind the smoke of frankincense in ancient temples. Akkad amber opens with an aromatic citrus head note of mandarin and bergamot, enhanced by Clary sage. Clary sage, also known as 'the sacred herb', is renowned for its euphoric, harmonising properties. The heart unfolds in the rich, balmy, spicy notes of frankincense and styrax, evocative of the ancient east, cooled by elemi, a fresh, soothing herb, and intensified by cardamom. The base with its two ambers of plant and animal origin centres on the woody richness of patchouli, sweetened with a sensual vanilla.","mandarin, bergamot, clary sage, cardamom, elemi, frankincense, styrax, amber cistus labdanum, vanilla patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31218.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,akkad luminous amber perfume mystical also sensual descent profane pleasures ancient tyrants exhalation sacred oils precious spices delphine thierry composed creation imagined amber note spicy luminous opposite therefore dark mystical ambers bring mind smoke frankincense ancient temples akkad amber opens aromatic citrus head note mandarin bergamot enhanced clary sage clary sage also known 'the sacred herb' renowned euphoric harmonising properties heart unfolds rich balmy spicy notes frankincense styrax evocative ancient east cooled elemi fresh soothing herb intensified cardamom base two ambers plant animal origin centres woody richness patchouli sweetened sensual vanilla,"mandarin, bergamot, clary sage, cardamom, elemi, frankincense, styrax, amber cistus labdanum, vanilla patchouli"
Galaad Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Galaad is a exotic leather fragrance, an invitation on a journey, the scent of an elegant rider who travels the world, a cosmopolitan spirit who loves the shade of tall trees and the freshness of mountain streams. A fragrance that is protective and assertive, yet utterly refined, emanating a peaceful self-assurance.
A heart of myrrh is topped with spices that bring out refreshing head notes (cardamom), and sustained by aromatic base notes (rosemary, cypress). The base is cool leather with wood and tobacco (blond tobacco, Atlas cedar, agar oud). Delphine Thierry, who created Galaad, invites us to a tranquil morning ride in the mountains of the Middle East, when the scents of myrrh bushes blend with cypress resins and the woody fragrance of cedars. The leather of saddle and gloves gently warm up in the first rays of sun, while the little Arab horse snorts amidst the morning dew that has settled on Judean balsam trees and on the vines climbing along the mountain slopes of Galaad.","cardamom, cypress, rosemary, myrrh, honey, copahu balm, agar oud, cedar, cipriol, blond burley tobacco",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31219.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,galaad exotic leather fragrance invitation journey scent elegant rider travels world cosmopolitan spirit loves shade tall trees freshness mountain streams fragrance protective assertive yet utterly refined emanating peaceful self assurance heart myrrh topped spices bring refreshing head notes cardamom sustained aromatic base notes rosemary cypress base cool leather wood tobacco blond tobacco atlas cedar agar oud delphine thierry created galaad invites us tranquil morning ride mountains middle east scents myrrh bushes blend cypress resins woody fragrance cedars leather saddle gloves gently warm first rays sun little arab horse snorts amidst morning dew settled judean balsam trees vines climbing along mountain slopes galaad,"cardamom, cypress, rosemary, myrrh, honey, copahu balm, agar oud, cedar, cipriol, blond burley tobacco"
Cuir Velours Eau de Parfum,Naomi Goodsir,"An opulent and boozy leather scent that is as velvety and luscious as a fresh peach. The leather note is smooth and supple, almost creamy, and is generously laced with rich tobacco, decadent rum and the dark, rough sweetness of the immortelle flower. At its best, as it is here, immortelle strikes us as the olfactory equivalent of a cat's purr â hints of ripe fruit and fresh hay wrapped in cozy, honeyed warmth. It winds itself around the leather and tobacco in the most delicious way. Incense and cistus labdanum add complexity, but with gentle brushstrokes.

Do Son - Eau de Parfum,Diptyque,"Now reformulated in an Eau de Parfum, the creamy tuberose can be had in an extra concentrated form. Inspired directly from Yves Coueslant's childhood in Vietnam, where he grew up in Haiphong, a port in Northern Indo-China.

Good Girl Gone Bad Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"GOOD GIRL GONE BAD is a composition of fruits and flowers, a perfume as bewitching as bursts of laughter, a barrier moved beyond, a forgotten prohibition.
The perfume opens on the fresh innocence of the petals of Jasmin Sambac and the apricot sweetness of Chinese Osmanthus. But that feminine ideal does not continue to fool anyone for long. Letting go of their demure appearances, the flowers toss off their inhibitions and reveal the other, decadent side of themselves. The Rose of May gives off its honeyed heat. The Indian Tuberose nakedly exhibits its milky roundness, while the narcotic sensuality of Egyptian Narcissus surges forth, uncontrollable and deliciously haunting. Notes of Virginia Cedar and Amber open up and try to assert their dominant character In order to contain that outpouring of opulence, but they never succeed in taming it completely. The tension is palpable; the addiction exacerbated; the pleasure consummated.","jasmin sambac, osmanthus, rose, tuberose, narcissus, violet accord, plum accord, cedar wood, amber, patchouli, vetiver, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42566.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,good girl gone bad composition fruits flowers perfume bewitching bursts laughter barrier moved beyond forgotten prohibition perfume opens fresh innocence petals jasmin sambac apricot sweetness chinese osmanthus feminine ideal continue fool anyone long letting go demure appearances flowers toss inhibitions reveal decadent side rose may gives honeyed heat indian tuberose nakedly exhibits milky roundness narcotic sensuality egyptian narcissus surges forth uncontrollable deliciously haunting notes virginia cedar amber open try assert dominant character order contain outpouring opulence never succeed taming completely tension palpable addiction exacerbated pleasure consummated,"jasmin sambac, osmanthus, rose, tuberose, narcissus, violet accord, plum accord, cedar wood, amber, patchouli, vetiver, musk"

08 - Seylon Eau de Parfum,Odin,"Harvested from the wild landscapes of Sri Lanka comes a scent that truly represents an authentic interpretation of pure vetiver. Seylon opens with the watery crispness of fresh yuzu followed by the tartness of bitter orange and bergamot. Middle notes of spicy nutmeg, resinous elemi and wormwood merge together with a rich base of warm benzoin, damp oakmoss and the soft earthiness of calming vetiver.
The creation of 08 Seylon communicates a new understanding of vetiver through a calming blend of rich, earthy aromas. During the initial stages of development it was essential that the fragrance represent actual vetiver, extracted from the root. With this in mind, not only is the finished concept an authentic interpretation, it also reflects perfumer, Phillipe Romano's idea that imposing structures such as orientals, woods, spices with exotic shades should transport you far away.","yuzu, bitter orange, bergamot, nutmeg, resinous elemi, wormwood, benzoin, damp oakmoss, vetiver",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50112.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,harvested wild landscapes sri lanka comes scent truly represents authentic interpretation pure vetiver seylon opens watery crispness fresh yuzu followed tartness bitter orange bergamot middle notes spicy nutmeg resinous elemi wormwood merge together rich base warm benzoin damp oakmoss soft earthiness calming vetiver creation seylon communicates new understanding vetiver calming blend rich earthy aromas initial stages development essential fragrance represent actual vetiver extracted root mind finished concept authentic interpretation also reflects perfumer phillipe romano's idea imposing structures orientals woods spices exotic shades transport far away,"yuzu, bitter orange, bergamot, nutmeg, resinous elemi, wormwood, benzoin, damp oakmoss, vetiver"
Amyris Pour Femme Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"Francis Kurkdjian conceives his fragrances with people in mind, and what he wanted for Amyris femme was to express the quintessence of the Parisian woman, which he defines as primesautiere, a word that means 'perky' and 'impulsive'. He also conceives his collection as a fragrance wardrobe for every moment of the day and with the Amyris his'n'hers duo, he wanted scents that could be shrugged on for daywear: chic, but comfortable enough not to demand major commitment before spritzing.
Amyris is a wood formerly known as West Indies sandalwood, which draws its name from the Greek amyron, 'intensely fragrant': it was in rediscovering its scent during exercises with his apprentice that Francis Kurkdjian was inspired to use it. The word itself included 'iris', which yields the core accord of the fragrance: orris butter â a high-quality variety with no rooty-earthy facets â and amyris, which teeters between sandalwood and cedar. To make the austere iris smile like an impish Parisienne, the perfumer wraps it in a sweet, plush lemon blossom and leaves accord and dabs it with a powder puff.

Amyris homme plays on the tough-tender duality with an aromatic opening brightened by a squirt of mandarin. For his iris note, the perfumer uses iris resinoid, which develops striking dark chocolate facets. It is this non-gourmand chocolate effect that Amyris homme plays on to express dusky masculine tenderness by setting the iris resinoid in a coconut, coffee and tonka bean, with its hay and tobacco facets suffused with a bitter-almond flavor. Unapologetically masculine â but with a twist â Amyris homme is as easy to slip on as a favorite white shirt and jeans outfit, yet chic enough to carry you into the cocktail hour.

Santal Majuscule Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Now that Santal Blanc has been shifted to the exclusive Palais-Royal collection, Serge Lutens's export line was bereft of a scent showcasing one of the major materials of his oriental palette. Santal Majuscule, which means 'sandalwood with a capital letter', plays on the secular harmony of this creamy, smoky, almost floral note with roses. The unexpected twist is the addition of cocoa â not the dry, powdery type matched with patchouli in Borneo 1834, but a smooth touch of chocolate that marries with the milkiness of sandalwood in a subtly gourmand accent. A tender, subtle rendition of the note: in 'majuscule', you could read 'magic' â as in the magical world of a little black-eyed boy called Serge, who put capital letters to words like 'Gold', 'Fire' and 'Flowers'.","sandalwood, rose, cocoa, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36141.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,santal blanc shifted exclusive palais royal collection serge lutens's export line bereft scent showcasing one major materials oriental palette santal majuscule means 'sandalwood capital letter' plays secular harmony creamy smoky almost floral note roses unexpected twist addition cocoa dry powdery type matched patchouli borneo smooth touch chocolate marries milkiness sandalwood subtly gourmand accent tender subtle rendition note 'majuscule' could read 'magic' magical world little black eyed boy called serge put capital letters words like 'gold' 'fire' 'flowers',"sandalwood, rose, cocoa, tonka bean"

X for Women Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian,"According to lore, Cleopatra so adored Egyptian jasmine, gathered from the banks of the Nile at dusk when the flower's scent is at its headiest, that she doused the sails of her ship with their essence on her journey to meet Mark Antony. As the fragrant breezes of this legendary flower snaked his way, legend has it, Mark Antony fell in love with the Egyptian queen, famous for her love of beautiful perfumes.
A soft and sensual fruity chypre, X for Women complements the soft eroticism of X for Men. Egyptian jasmine is refreshed and made momentarily sharp by fruit notes such as tart rhubarb and juicy peach and pineapple. Vanilla and labdanum soften and enrich those notes, and the perfume is made even more erotic with the X series' signature note of Karo Karundi, a white flower essence from the West African shrub whose scent recalls the Acacia flower and is reputed to be an aphrodisiac.
The notes in X for Women blend beautifully not only with each other, but also with skin, creating a warm, sweet and luscious skin scent that, like X for men, could be described as approachably erotic. Comforting and stunning.","peach, mandarin, bergamot, rhubarb, pineapple, jasmine, rose, lily of the valley, orris, patchouli, cedarwood, vetiver, vanilla, cashmere musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/58007.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,according lore cleopatra adored egyptian jasmine gathered banks nile dusk flower's scent headiest doused sails ship essence journey meet mark antony fragrant breezes legendary flower snaked way legend mark antony fell love egyptian queen famous love beautiful perfumes soft sensual fruity chypre x women complements soft eroticism x men egyptian jasmine refreshed made momentarily sharp fruit notes tart rhubarb juicy peach pineapple vanilla labdanum soften enrich notes perfume made even erotic x series' signature note karo karundi white flower essence west african shrub whose scent recalls acacia flower reputed aphrodisiac notes x women blend beautifully also skin creating warm sweet luscious skin scent like x men could described approachably erotic comforting stunning,"peach, mandarin, bergamot, rhubarb, pineapple, jasmine, rose, lily valley, orris, patchouli, cedarwood, vetiver, vanilla, cashmere musk"
X for Men Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian,"Take the lushest jasmine and light it on fire with the warming spices of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom. Let it smolder on a bed of rich orris and vanilla as aromatic rays of cedarwood subtly radiate in the background, and you have Clive Christian's cuddly yet sexy X for Men.
In Clive Christian's X Series, perfume's aphrodisiac qualities are brought to the fore. In X for Men, orris (from the Iris flower's buttery rich and powdery soft roots) and Karo Karundi (a white flower essence from the West African shrub whose scent is reminiscent of Acacia) both help to power X for Men's gentle eros. Although cedarwood, a conventionally masculine note, hums continuously throughout X for Men, the perfume leans closer as a unisex fragrance, and could equally be inhaled from a male or female lover's pulse points and neck.

A sheer and fresh Rose de Mai â whose green facets are pushed to the fore by lily of the valley â glimmers at the heart of 1872 for Women. Also known as the 'painter's rose', this precious flower blooms only for three weeks in Grasse, France, and it takes 170 heads of Rose de Mai for just one drop of 1872 for Women.

No. 1 for Women Eau de Parfum,Clive Christian,"Undeniably feminine, with an olfactory arc that moves from transporting and fresh-aromatic to otherworldly, exotic and decadent, No. 1 for Women is a first-class perfume ticket to a floral wonderland. The best Indian jasmine, Tahitian vanilla, Rose Centifolia, carnation and ylang-ylang, make up No. 1's heart, helping to explain the perfume's designation as the world's most expensive, made without reference to cost. But this cost helps produce an intoxicating scent experience that is recognizably special at first spray.
No. 1 starts with a floral high that sustains itself operatically, with subtle pineapple, plum and lemon revolving around intense jasmine and ylang-ylang notes. It then evolves into an ambery vanilla base touched with cedar, musk and the smoothest sandalwood. By the time the perfume dries down, the marriage of these precious ingredients is seamless, and the floral drama subsides into a comforting, ambery-vanillic warmth that lasts.

Oud - Eau de Parfum,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"It isn't because Francis Kurkdjian called this fragrance just plain Oud that he meant it to be a plain-vanilla oud. The man couldn't be pedestrian if he tried. And what he's gone and done is work what he calls 'the ambergris of the 21st century' into a quintessentially elegant French perfume, taming the growling exotic beast until it purrs with pure bliss on a silk cushion. This is an oud even the most ouded-out could curl up with. Sweetly leathery and animalic, with the touch of honey real oud gives off â and there is real Laotian oud in the blend. With its citrus and pepper facets, elemi resin adds sparkle to the top notes. Saffron brings out the leather effects of oud, set into the tenderest woods: the leathery, almost jam-sweet Atlas cedar, and a lavish, un-musty patchouli. Francis Kurkdjian says he composed his Oud while dreaming of a marble and gold palace in the desert sands fit for 'the prince of raw materials'. He's done more than that: he's turned oud into a flawlessly elegant classic of the perfumer's palette.","elemi resin, saffron, cedar, patchouli, oud",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49822.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,francis kurkdjian called fragrance plain oud meant plain vanilla oud man pedestrian tried he's gone done work calls 'the ambergris st century' quintessentially elegant french perfume taming growling exotic beast purrs pure bliss silk cushion oud even ouded could curl sweetly leathery animalic touch honey real oud gives real laotian oud blend citrus pepper facets elemi resin adds sparkle top notes saffron brings leather effects oud set tenderest woods leathery almost jam sweet atlas cedar lavish un musty patchouli francis kurkdjian says composed oud dreaming marble gold palace desert sands fit 'the prince raw materials' he's done he's turned oud flawlessly elegant classic perfumer's palette,"elemi resin, saffron, cedar, patchouli, oud"

Bamboo Harmony Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"BAMBOO HARMONY pays homage to Bamboo, considered by the 'Men of Letters' as the symbol of human perfection. It is also the main component of their brush, the central element of calligraphy which, in Chinese culture, is the representation of Art and Beauty.
BAMBOO HARMONY is the olfactive impression of a subtle sip of white tea taken in the heart of a bamboo.
BAMBOO HARMONY opens with luminous notes of Bergamot, Bigarade and Neroli. The perfume then evolves through a comforting heart combining white tea leaves - known for their sumptuous flavor and lustrous color - and Mimosa, highlighted with a touch of spices. The unique character of the trail is given by rare Mate Essence, interlaced with sensual fig leaves and oak moss.

S-ex Eau de Parfum,S-Perfume,"S-ex (pronounced 'es-ex') isn't another avant-garde perfume that claims, in flowery prose, to be the perfume representation of sweaty sheets. S-ex is hardcore sultry and fresh at the same time-- a sheer and sensual daredevil of a scent that toys with opposites. It's a wet, sensual skin musk meets just washed, clean skin; all through it is a animalistic leather (with a metallic tinge) toying with fresh and crisp notes like bergamot. S-ex is a well balanced study of opposites attract; and we like that despite the name, it's not some one-trick-pony weighed down solely by heavy hitters. Instead, it arouses your senses with both depth and sheerness; it's steely and gentle, quiet and smoldering, and it does it all without falling in the women's-only or men's-only scent camp. If you love sensual, headboard-grabbing fragrances but have longed for a perfume that's wearable anywhere and any time of day, then a little S-ex is just what you need. In the V magazine, Author Chandler Burr once wrote 'a masterful, complex juxtaposition of elements that gives the scent of the genitalia of a freshly shampooed beast.'","bergamot, nutmeg, pepper, leather, jasmine, sandalwood, patchouli, birchwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/57401.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,ex pronounced 'es ex' another avant garde perfume claims flowery prose perfume representation sweaty sheets ex hardcore sultry fresh time sheer sensual daredevil scent toys opposites wet sensual skin musk meets washed clean skin animalistic leather metallic tinge toying fresh crisp notes like bergamot ex well balanced study opposites attract like despite name one trick pony weighed solely heavy hitters instead arouses senses depth sheerness steely gentle quiet smoldering without falling women's men's scent camp love sensual headboard grabbing fragrances longed perfume that's wearable anywhere time day little ex need v magazine author chandler burr wrote 'a masterful complex juxtaposition elements gives scent genitalia freshly shampooed beast ',"bergamot, nutmeg, pepper, leather, jasmine, sandalwood, patchouli, birchwood"
100% Love Eau de Parfum,S-Perfume,"Sweet, provocative and daring...you wouldn't expect anything else from a creation by the legendary Sophia Grojsman (Eternity by Calvin Klein, Yves Saint Laurent's Paris, Tresor by LanceÂme, and many, many more). It's a whirlwind of a perfume twisting and turning with a passionate swirl of black cacao, deep, red fruits and florals. Soft rose notes are a velvety embrace, a masterful turn that allows the dusty cocoa-like notes in 100% Love to shine just right... but not enough to be exactly like a box of chocolates.

Francois Charles Eau de Parfum,Rance,"Francois Rance, the founder of the Maison RANCE, taught his sons and grandsons the art of creating awe-inspiring perfumes and passed on his passion for Napoleon, the sublime Hero who personified French glory. Francois' son Jean Rance devoted this perfume to FRANCOIS CHARLES, Napoleon's only son. It was hoped that the young Prince could repeat his majestic father's feats, and like him, bring the great ideals France's victories had introduced throughout Europe to triumph.
This perfume lives again today, and we can admire its sobriety and immediacy, the intensity of its fragrance, and its continuous variation in notes. It is like walking in a forest through a gradually changing sequence of plants, flowers and wild herbs, and smelling their different successive scents. It is a very manly perfume which goes straight to the hearts of nature lovers.

This was the highest consecration of military and political genius, which led to the fulfilment of the ideals of Liberty and Reform of the French Revolution.

Fils de Dieu Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"The tagline for this Fils de Dieu, du Riz et des Agrumes ('Son of God, rice and citrus' is 'He brings the sunshine'). But despite these distinctly religious references, there is nary a tear of incense in Ralf Schwieger's debut scent for Etat Libre d'Orange. And despite a list of notes that almost reads like the recipe for a South-eastern Asian dish, Fils de Dieu never veers into the foody: rather, it shows how the aromas lacing one of the most refined cuisines in the world are also perfumes. The green, citrusy top notes add sparkle to the cardamom and ginger, churning up the milky, powdery accents of the rice and coconut notes. The latter is picked up by the lactonic facets in jasmine, while a rich May rose hints that the Queen of flowers and steamed rice may have secret affinities.
Then as it moves into the drydown, Fils de Dieu reveals its animal nature by exhaling a soft, dark leather note, more suede than rawhide, infused with musk. And we sing Hallelujah.","ginger, coriander leaves, lime, shiso, bergamot, jungle essence coconut, rice note, jungle essence cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, may rose, tonka bean, vetiver, musk, amber, leather, castoreum",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47741.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tagline fils de dieu du riz et des agrumes 'son god rice citrus' 'he brings sunshine' despite distinctly religious references nary tear incense ralf schwieger's debut scent etat libre d'orange despite list notes almost reads like recipe south eastern asian dish fils de dieu never veers foody rather shows aromas lacing one refined cuisines world also perfumes green citrusy top notes add sparkle cardamom ginger churning milky powdery accents rice coconut notes latter picked lactonic facets jasmine rich may rose hints queen flowers steamed rice may secret affinities moves drydown fils de dieu reveals animal nature exhaling soft dark leather note suede rawhide infused musk sing hallelujah,"ginger, coriander leaves, lime, shiso, bergamot, jungle essence coconut, rice note, jungle essence cardamom, jasmine, cinnamon, may rose, tonka bean, vetiver, musk, amber, leather, castoreum"
Bijou Romantique Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"The name comes from a line said by Hugo Pratt's cult graphic novel hero, the half-gypsy sailor Corto Maltese, in The Ballad of the Salt Sea: 'Adieu, bijou romantique' ('Farewell, romantic jewel). The tagline, 'Her price is far above rubies', is drawn from the Scriptures.
As for the scent, it is by Mathilde Bijaoui, whose dark beauty would have surely inspired Hugo Pratt had he known her. It was Mathilde who signed the critically acclaimed Tilda Swinton Like This, and with Bijou Romantique she offers another delicately hued composition that hovers just on the edge of being the most ethereal gourmand, with the subtle chocolate facets of iris, vetiver blending into the creaminess of vanilla and benzoin. Laboratoire Mane's captive molecule EVEE bridges the gap between vanilla and spices, lightly brushing the blend with the burn of clove.
Tender, complex and multi-facetted, Bijou Romantique lives up to its name.

Precious Oud Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels,"In 2009, Van Cleef & Arpels Haute Parfumerie stepped out with a range sublimating emblematic essences. That is how Collection Extraordinaire, a range of monofloral compositions and a cologne, came about. Today, a new chapter has been added to this wonderful story. Following on from the great classics, the timeless foundations of the collection, a 'free form' piece glorifying Oud essence has been created.
The new opus, Precious Oud, pays homage to a mythical essence. The aquilaria, an Asian or Indian tree, actually only reveals its powerful scent via the infection of the wood by a fungus. A magi-like essence alongside frankincense and myrrh, the fragrant Oud resin, woody and balsamic, adds earthy and leathery accents. The perfumer Amandine Marie has chosen to interpret Oud essence and associate it with flowers. The top note is bright and sparkling bergamot set off with pink peppercorn whilst already hinting at the tonality of the perfume with the scent of opulent incense. The heart note is a vibrant bouquet of the most beautiful flowers - sensual jasmine accompanied by tuberose. If not the queen of perfumery, then the tuberose could very well be the empress with its bewitching, divinely heady scent. There is a woody note of patchouli, and the base notes open up, opulent, rich and precious, surrounding the mythical Oud with the woody notes of sandalwood and vetiver and enveloping it in accents of amber.
With its warm and sensual sillage, Precious Oud embodies the new opus of Collection Extraordinaire. A perfume with character, it has paved the way for new inspiration, totally free art where only the most noble, precious materials are given pride of place and the guiding principle is excellence.","bergamot, pink pepper, incense, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, oud, sandalwood, vetiver ambergris",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/50207.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,van cleef arpels haute parfumerie stepped range sublimating emblematic essences collection extraordinaire range monofloral compositions cologne came today new chapter added wonderful story following great classics timeless foundations collection 'free form' piece glorifying oud essence created new opus precious oud pays homage mythical essence aquilaria asian indian tree actually reveals powerful scent via infection wood fungus magi like essence alongside frankincense myrrh fragrant oud resin woody balsamic adds earthy leathery accents perfumer amandine marie chosen interpret oud essence associate flowers top note bright sparkling bergamot set pink peppercorn whilst already hinting tonality perfume scent opulent incense heart note vibrant bouquet beautiful flowers sensual jasmine accompanied tuberose queen perfumery tuberose could well empress bewitching divinely heady scent woody note patchouli base notes open opulent rich precious surrounding mythical oud woody notes sandalwood vetiver enveloping accents amber warm sensual sillage precious oud embodies new opus collection extraordinaire perfume character paved way new inspiration totally free art noble precious materials given pride place guiding principle excellence,"bergamot, pink pepper, incense, jasmine, tuberose, patchouli, oud, sandalwood, vetiver ambergris"
Dark,Andrea Maack Parfums,"Dark is heavily oxidized rose mixed with violets and leather. It's a take on the classic rose note, a bloody, flowery, leathery, seductive perfume with a purpose. The heavy metallic note in the scent brings an unexpected urprise while its animalistic and powdery side suggests certain comfort - both reassuring and protective. Dark is a scent with a mind of its own, and it can take you to places you never dreamed of going.
New for Winter 2018: Andrea Maack has doubled down on this cult classic rose scent, keeping the beloved original formula intact while upgrading the quality and rarity of each ingredient. Now, the rose note is fresher, juicier, and lusher, keeping the sparkling metallic accord and gently animalic leather in a cleaner balance and seriously upping the seductive factor.

What We Do In Paris Is Secret Eau de Parfum,A Lab on Fire,"You know how the notes in some perfumes read like something from your wildest, fragrant dreams but end up smelling like a Franken-fume, something you should love but don't, something that's less than the sum of its parts? What We Do In Paris Is Secret actually exceeds the gorgeous sounding symphony of its notes (and that's a hard thing to do!). It's impossible not to be lured in by the rich, sweet notes of vanilla, honey, tonka bean and tolu, the warm sensuality of sandalwood, musks, ambergris, and the playful Turkish rose, lychee and bergamot. Addictive doesn't quite explain it-- we couldn't keep this away from our skin when we first sampled (honestly) and oh, by the way? It makes heads turn. Not in thatâÂYou're leaving a vapor trail!' way, but in that, 'Please tell me what you're wearing now!' way. Creamy, decadent, honeyed and sensual.

Sombre Negra Eau de Parfum,YOSH,"Sombre Negra, or black shadow, is the debut scent in the new 'M' Series by San Francisco perfumer, Yosh Han. Highly sought after for her exclusive custom fragrances, Han says, 'The 'M' series is a departure from the ethereal quality of my previous collections and explores fragrances that evoke our deepest nature.'
Sombre Negra is a double agent. Intelligent, beguiling, captivating. The man who wears Sombre Negra is not what he seems. He is elegant and forbidden. His presence is undeniable but he can vanish without a trace. The woman who wears Sombre Negra is a smoldering beauty. Highly perceptive and discerning, she knows more than she lets on. She sees beyond the shadows, without fear of the unknown.
Please note, this is a newly re-imagined Sombre Negra.Perfumer Notes: 'I launched a Limited Edition Sombre Negra exclusively with LuckyScent in 2010. That fragrance to me was dark and edgy. Very dense. I wanted to explore the idea of shadows and their mutations so I decided to create a new edition of Sombre Negra. The new M:001 Sombre Negra incorporates citrus top notes that reflect a flash of lightning - a spark of fire that quickly vanishes but casts new and elongated shadows. Rose, tonka and orris were added to give it some depth and fullness. Nutmeg and cumin give the fragrance a kind of vegetative musk and suede element to an otherwise smokey and leathery fragrance. It is still very masculine but Sombre Negra is also the 'boyfriend fragrance' that women are falling in love with and keeping for themselves.","vetiver, patchouli, cedar, olibanum, pink pepperberry black peppercorn, clove, juniper, citrus, nutmeg, cumin, tonka orris root",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22823.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,sombre negra black shadow debut scent new 'm' series san francisco perfumer yosh han highly sought exclusive custom fragrances han says 'the 'm' series departure ethereal quality previous collections explores fragrances evoke deepest nature ' sombre negra double agent intelligent beguiling captivating man wears sombre negra seems elegant forbidden presence undeniable vanish without trace woman wears sombre negra smoldering beauty highly perceptive discerning knows lets sees beyond shadows without fear unknown please note newly imagined sombre negra perfumer notes 'i launched limited edition sombre negra exclusively luckyscent fragrance dark edgy dense wanted explore idea shadows mutations decided create new edition sombre negra new sombre negra incorporates citrus top notes reflect flash lightning spark fire quickly vanishes casts new elongated shadows rose tonka orris added give depth fullness nutmeg cumin give fragrance kind vegetative musk suede element otherwise smokey leathery fragrance still masculine sombre negra also 'boyfriend fragrance' women falling love keeping,"vetiver, patchouli, cedar, olibanum, pink pepperberry black peppercorn, clove, juniper, citrus, nutmeg, cumin, tonka orris root"
Geisha Rouge - Eau de Parfum,Aroma M,"In response to numerous clamorous requests, Aroma-M announces the eau de parfum version of her best selling Geisha Rouge perfume oil.
The difference? While this formulation Geisha Rouge is warm, beckoning, enticing.

Dolce Acqua Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"If you know the Profumum line, you may have noticed that they often involve a bit of a journey. We generally start with where they begin, but this time we'll start with where Dolce Acqua ends: a room where cookies have been baking all day. Vanilla, almond and coconut in a doughy blend with a flourish of powdered sugar and that hint of cherry that we associate with heliotrope. There is also a little something cool in the mix that we can't quite put our fingers on â balsam-like and airy. There is a nostalgic quality â a hint of beloved childhood confections that melt on the tongue. Testing it on three generations, they each recalled a different beloved treat â so we can't say it resembles a particular delicacy as much as it evokes the memories of someone baking your favorite thing for you. So, if you end up with a dreamy vanilla almond fluffery that coddles and soothes, where do you begin? With a boisterous and boozy caramel-like vanilla with a pronounced swirl of almond, which then takes a fascinating detour into something mysteriously reminiscent of beeswax, before it arrives at its soft and comforting destination.","coconut, heliotrope, almond, vanilla, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33932.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,know profumum line may noticed often involve bit journey generally start begin time we'll start dolce acqua ends room cookies baking day vanilla almond coconut doughy blend flourish powdered sugar hint cherry associate heliotrope also little something cool mix can't quite put fingers balsam like airy nostalgic quality hint beloved childhood confections melt tongue testing three generations recalled different beloved treat can't say resembles particular delicacy much evokes memories someone baking favorite thing end dreamy vanilla almond fluffery coddles soothes begin boisterous boozy caramel like vanilla pronounced swirl almond takes fascinating detour something mysteriously reminiscent beeswax arrives soft comforting destination,"coconut, heliotrope, almond, vanilla, tonka bean"

Inspired by the invigorating if not entirely effective remedies supplied to the pioneers in the Wild West during the 19th century gold rush.

Itasca Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"The scent of North American forest. The Mississippi river finds its main source in the legendary Lake Itasca in the heart of Minnesota.

Kinski Eau de Toilette,Kinski,"KINSKI the fragrance is a richly decadent, textured scent produced under license from Kinski Productions, to mark the 20th anniversary of the legendary actor's death. Effervescent notes of cassis and juniper provide an uplifting contrast to the dark notes of madness evidenced in castoreum, smoky vetiver and dark woods. The image of Kinski portraying Count Dracula in Werner Herzog's expressionistic cinematic masterpiece Nosferatu The Vampyre emerges, as the heady notes of blood-red wine rises from the dusty, dirt floors of an unlit cellar. Dry herbs crackle softly as they crumble in hand. Salty oceanic notes reveal themselves in the heart, inspired by Kinski's love of the sea. The animalic and woody base of the composition reflects Kinski's almost feral sensuality.
The simple and bold graphic design of the bottle hints at an essence of fragmentation, echoing the actor's famously splintered personality.

Azemour les Orangers Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Parfum d'Empire fragrances are always highly concentrated both in rich natural essences and intense emotion. But even so, Azemour stands apart. Just as Eau de Gloire was a tribute to Corsica, the homeland of Marc-Antoine Corticchiato's family, Azemour is a loving reminiscence of Morocco where he was born and grew up. The name is taken from the ancient city of Azemmour on the Atlantic coast, near the orange groves his parents once owned. As for the scent, it is an olfactory landscape that captures the exhilarating fragrances of the orange tree, from the fruit and leaves to the flowers and bark, generously sprinkled with a blend of spices. A glorious quality of hay absolute, oak moss and henna absolute â a typically Moroccan scent reminiscent of Argentinean mate â conjure the dry vegetation of the groves and dunes. A tiny, briny accent (no, it isn't an aquatic note) adds a touch of sea spray. Wood notes trace the undulating silhouettes of cypresses in the Atlantic wind.
And best of all, for those of us who love classic fragrance families, Azemour is a robust, vibrant, hesperidic chypre, so full-fleshed you'll feel you could bite it.","orange, clementine, tangerine, grapefruit, coriander, cumin, black pepper, pink pepper, blackcurrant, galbanum, neroli, geranium, orange blossom, rose, hay, moss, henna cypres",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35712.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,parfum d'empire fragrances always highly concentrated rich natural essences intense emotion even azemour stands apart eau de gloire tribute corsica homeland marc antoine corticchiato's family azemour loving reminiscence morocco born grew name taken ancient city azemmour atlantic coast near orange groves parents owned scent olfactory landscape captures exhilarating fragrances orange tree fruit leaves flowers bark generously sprinkled blend spices glorious quality hay absolute oak moss henna absolute typically moroccan scent reminiscent argentinean mate conjure dry vegetation groves dunes tiny briny accent aquatic note adds touch sea spray wood notes trace undulating silhouettes cypresses atlantic wind best us love classic fragrance families azemour robust vibrant hesperidic chypre full fleshed feel could bite,"orange, clementine, tangerine, grapefruit, coriander, cumin, black pepper, pink pepper, blackcurrant, galbanum, neroli, geranium, orange blossom, rose, hay, moss, henna cypres"
L'Ambre de Carthage Eau de Parfum,Isabey,"In the 1920s the House of Isabey stood at 20 rue de la Paix and was the destination of the most chic parisians. Its perfumes evoked exotic travels and fantasies inspired by flowers, spices and other fragrant materials. L'Ambre de Carthage of 1924 was hailed as one of the jewels of the perfumed crown. Today Isabey revives the name of L'Ambre de Carthage in a modern masculine fragrance symbolizing the spirit of long, challenging journeys and adventures.
The scent is for those whose life is a journey. Ancient Carthage held a position as one of the capitals of maritime trade; its ports teaming with trade ships transporting the precious cargo of far off lands. L'Ambre de Carthage begins with the crisp notes of Mediterranean citrus and settles into the warm ambery scent of cistus labdunum. The journey proceeds to China where delicate osmanthus flowers and aromatic jasmine tea offers a soft counterpart to the darker notes of olibanum incense. The adventure ends in India, traveling through unknown towns and landscapes finding delight in the earthy scent of patchouli and precious sandalwood.

Indochine Eau de Toilette,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","The ever-prolific, ever-inventive Pierre Guillaume takes the oriental genre as far as it can go â in fact, all the way to the Far-East â with Indochine, a scent inspired by the dream of a languid cruise down the Mekong in the 1920s.
Over the course of his imaginary journey, Guillaume has gathered ingredients rarely used in perfumery as a sensuous setting for benzoin's vanillic, powdery and spicy facets. Its creaminess is brought out by the smoky, milky undertones of tanakha, a traditional cosmetic whose smell is reminiscent of sandalwood. Subtle Kampot pepper from Cambodia, considered to be the best in the world, and green, sparkling Ceylonese cardamom, underline the spiciness, while Laotian honey wraps the accords in the quirky-gourmand notes that are the trademark of so many Parfumerie Generale fragrances.
The result is a fascinating, intensely sensuous fragrance that feels as though it could be burned in a temple, blended into an edible delicacy or used in an aphrodisiac ritual.

L'eau Chic Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"The name says it all. Patricia de Nicolae keeps turning out some of the most classically elegant fragrances on the market, and her addition to her 'eau' line is as effortlessly chic as a crisp cotton shirt on a summer morning.
The perfumer was inspired by the geranium-scented soaps she used to love as a child in her parents' bathroom. The challenge, she said, was softening the sharp, tangy facets of geranium oil, and making it original without covering it up.
Spearmint and peppermint boost geranium's own cool minty facets; lavender adds its clean, aromatic freshness while in contrast, a duet of hot spices â clove and pimiento â team up with milky sandalwood and the to ground L'Eau Chic in warmth. Roman chamomile, with its herbal, green, boozy, spicy and woody facets, adds sophistication and complexity to the blend. But just like that indefinable set of qualities that make up chic, L'Eau Chic is more than the sum of its parts: it is bursting with well-bred confidence, with the classic vibe of a scent that could have been used for several generations by a family of slightly eccentric aristocrats, yet bracingly modern.

Honour Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Honour Man, the regal, dramatic masculine fragrance with a spicy, woody character, is heir to Amouage's ongoing (soap) operatic narrative that began with Jubilation, and continued on with Lyric, Epic, and Memoir.
With an intensely peppery, dark opening, Honour Man creates olfactory storm clouds of disquiet, confusion, and drama befitting its back story, which was written by the perfume house's creative director Christopher Chong and inspired by Puccini's tragic opera Madame Butterfly.
In Chong's melodramatic creative brief, Honour is the son of Madame Butterfly, Puccini's tragic heroine who commits suicide when the American soldier who abandoned her years before returns to take their son. Honour has come back, so the narrative goes, to confront his mother's tragedy and to come to terms with his identity.
After the blast of pepper, Honour Man allows a fresh, rosy-floral note from geranium to peek through the dark clouds, followed by a succession of warm, woody, and spicy notes, including an intense patchouli that reminds us that Honour is still a fiery young man. Chong suggests that these comforting, beautifully blended base notes represent the reconciliation of our hero's troubled quest with his 'filial elegy to honour his mother.' Its dry down does indeed feel like the denouement to a stormy, existential drama. Honour Man is housed in a white crystal bottle with a gold-plated cap affixed with a white opal Svarovski crystal.","pink pepper, black pepper, geranium, elemi, nutmeg, patchouli, frankincense, cedarwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41824.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,honour man regal dramatic masculine fragrance spicy woody character heir amouage's ongoing soap operatic narrative began jubilation continued lyric epic memoir intensely peppery dark opening honour man creates olfactory storm clouds disquiet confusion drama befitting back story written perfume house's creative director christopher chong inspired puccini's tragic opera madame butterfly chong's melodramatic creative brief honour son madame butterfly puccini's tragic heroine commits suicide american soldier abandoned years returns take son honour come back narrative goes confront mother's tragedy come terms identity blast pepper honour man allows fresh rosy floral note geranium peek dark clouds followed succession warm woody spicy notes including intense patchouli reminds us honour still fiery young man chong suggests comforting beautifully blended base notes represent reconciliation hero's troubled quest 'filial elegy honour mother ' dry indeed feel like denouement stormy existential drama honour man housed white crystal bottle gold plated cap affixed white opal svarovski crystal,"pink pepper, black pepper, geranium, elemi, nutmeg, patchouli, frankincense, cedarwood, vetiver, tonka bean, musk"
Honour Woman Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"Inspired by Puccini's opera Madame Butterfly, Amouage Honour Woman is a delicate and even emotional rendition of white florals. (How could it not be emotional when it's based on the story of a heroine who kills herself when the American soldier she's pined for returns to her homeland to take their child?) 'Death with honour, ' proclaims the heroine before dying, 'when one can no longer live in honour.'
Honour Woman opens with a tart rhubarb note and ends on a smooth base of subtly spicy resins, amber and almost imperceptible leather. But the showstopper of Honour Woman is its floral heart. Gardenia, which is often deployed to bring out its hot-house flower sultriness, is here transparent and light, flanked like a princess in white with her attendants lily-of-the-valley, jasmine, carnation and a very subdued tuberose. It's as if the passionate gardenia that Madame Butterfly's Cio Cio San once was gives way, after Pinkerton's betrayal, to a more stoic and elegant â if tragic â version of the flower. Eros transformed into Thanatos.
As it dries down, traces of rhubarb remain as its subtly spicy and warm base rises up. Even without the perfume's melodramatic back story, Honour Woman's fragrant narrative is powerful on its own.

Pardon Parfum Extrait,Nasomatto,"""The fragrance aims to evoke the persuasion of utmost masculine elegance and charm."" The Nose. Nasomatto's Pardon takes a dark, woodsy richness and nudges it â ever-so-gently â into a surprisingly softer direction for the Italian niche line.
As seems fitting with the name's connotations of polite society and gentility, Pardon tones down the line's characteristic hard-core intensity. Unlike the brute, narcotic beauty of Black Afgano or the forward wildness of Duro, Pardon wants to persuade you of its masculine elegance and charm, reverberating creating a fragrance at once seductive and refined.

Oudh Osmanthus Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"A lot of different perfumes called Oud claim they contain real oud. But what is important to know and to understand about this phenomenon is that most of them contain a synthetic base which reproduces the scent of oud and not the essential oil of oud itself which is very different. Mme Mona di Orio has studied both of them and the aura, the intensity, the beauty, the depth of the natural one is so fantastic, so magical, so mysterious and complex compared to the synthetic one which is simply a nice woody, leathery, spicy base without any vibration or any mystery.
The first time Mme Di Orio smelt a sample of an oud essential oil, she was not at all convinced. There are many different qualities and origins, and as she was not seduced, she was not really interested to work with it. Last year her provider called her he just had received a new quality from Laos and this time when she smelt it, she was totally subjugated, intoxicated. Such an aura, such an essential oil, at this moment Mme Di Orio realized deeply why this product was so mystical, intimate and secret for thousands of years and through many religions in the world. Just to give an idea about its value: 18,000 Euro for one kilo-- about half a kilo compared to the price of gold. She wanted to create something unique and thought about blending oud with somethimg rare and also precious, really different and unexpected like the absolute osmanthus from China. Created from a real oud essential oil, distilled by traditional hand methods in Laos; the source of oud is from a tree that has been replanted and cultivated under fair trade practices.
The enigmatic and much-prized essential oil of real Oudh from Laos radiates from the centre of Mona di Orio's 'Oud' casting a mystical spell on the other notes and highlighting their beauty. This fragrance opens with notes of hesperides and spices like elemi, petitgrain and green mandarin, mingled in a seductive encounter. Like a love potion with a radiant sensuality, the Oudh reveals one by one its troubling facets, alternated between animal, leathery, woody or balsamic. They embrace in a passionate vibration to a shadowy patchouli, a mysterious nagarmotha, a cedar from Atlas and a grey amber, a spellbinding formula rich and headily. Absolu osmanthus, the carnal flower with its warm mesmeric charming hints of jasmin, honey and apricot tempers the forceful power of the Oudh by its gourmand nectar.

Back to Black Eau de Parfum - ...,By Kilian,"When you call your scent 'aphrodisiac', you'd better be fairly sure you're not overreaching yourself. This latest release from By Kilian, is the sixth composed for the house by Calice Becker, is as head-turning a love potion as you're ever likely to spritz on. That is, if you enjoy the velvet-smooth, burning liquid umber of a great cognac and the hay-like scent of tobacco steeped in fruit and honey, or sipping a fine amaretto on a bed of moss. Who doesn't?
Back to Black is an olfactory trip to Arabia â or perhaps to the exotica-mad 1920s, when Caron gave Tabac Blond to sultry, cigarette-smoking garconnes. The tobacco accord is slyly evoked through the herbal, faintly animalic scent of chamomile laced with honey; the honey in its turn conjures faintly floral aromas. Throughout its development, Back to Black runs through a palette of subtly gourmand flavors, from ripe, almost fermented raspberry to the dry cocoa powder of patchouli, along with almond and vanilla, without ever veering into tooth-aching sweetness thanks to the bitter, cooling effect of cardamom, coriander, vetiver and moss. It stretches out languorously on the skin for hours, displaying its dark facets, leaving you hungry for more Arabian nights in its amber glow.","bergamot, raspberry, blue chamomile, cardamom, coriander, saffron, cedarwood, vanilla, almond, vetiver, cistus labdanum, patchouli, oakmoss",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42522.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,call scent 'aphrodisiac' better fairly sure overreaching latest release kilian sixth composed house calice becker head turning love potion ever likely spritz enjoy velvet smooth burning liquid umber great cognac hay like scent tobacco steeped fruit honey sipping fine amaretto bed moss back black olfactory trip arabia perhaps exotica mad caron gave tabac blond sultry cigarette smoking garconnes tobacco accord slyly evoked herbal faintly animalic scent chamomile laced honey honey turn conjures faintly floral aromas throughout development back black runs palette subtly gourmand flavors ripe almost fermented raspberry dry cocoa powder patchouli along almond vanilla without ever veering tooth aching sweetness thanks bitter cooling effect cardamom coriander vetiver moss stretches languorously skin hours displaying dark facets leaving hungry arabian nights amber glow,"bergamot, raspberry, blue chamomile, cardamom, coriander, saffron, cedarwood, vanilla, almond, vetiver, cistus labdanum, patchouli, oakmoss"

Black Jade Eau de Parfum,Lubin,"Marie Antoinette, the infamous young queen of France -- initially loved by the people for her charm and beauty, she became an international symbol of decadent luxury. Naturally her court had a royal perfumer, Jean-Louis Fargeon, and, naturally, he created an opulent, no-expenses-spared fragrance exclusively for her. Inspired by her rose-filled garden at Le Petit Trianon, this mysterious concoction was kept in a black jade flask which the queen kept with her at all times. Luckily for us, the perfumer had a young apprentice, Pierre Lubin, who paid closer attention to the formula for this elixir than perhaps he should have. Known in the House of Lubin for years as 'jardin secret', the formula has been newly revived with the help of one of Marie's black jade bottles that had been hidden away by a confidante. Fittingly, it is now known as Black Jade.
Yes, yes, you say, thanks for the history lesson and all, but what is the juice itself like? Rich. Seductive. Alluring. As deliciously extravagant as you would expect from a queen notorious for her lavish tastes. This was a tribute to her beloved garden, so of course there are flowers, but this is no simple, country garden. These are flowers for royalty. Lush, satiny roses and frilly jasmine are embroidered with cardamom and cinnamon and exotic incense, then layered over a velvety base of patchouli, tonka bean, vanilla and amber. The opening is surprisingly cool and spicy, then as the floral heart opens and the roses bloom, it becomes warm and enticing and compelling. Exquisitely confident and unapologetically luxurious.","galbanum, bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, incense, cinnamon, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31214.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,marie antoinette infamous young queen france initially loved people charm beauty became international symbol decadent luxury naturally court royal perfumer jean louis fargeon naturally created opulent expenses spared fragrance exclusively inspired rose filled garden le petit trianon mysterious concoction kept black jade flask queen kept times luckily us perfumer young apprentice pierre lubin paid closer attention formula elixir perhaps known house lubin years 'jardin secret' formula newly revived help one marie's black jade bottles hidden away confidante fittingly known black jade yes yes say thanks history lesson juice like rich seductive alluring deliciously extravagant would expect queen notorious lavish tastes tribute beloved garden course flowers simple country garden flowers royalty lush satiny roses frilly jasmine embroidered cardamom cinnamon exotic incense layered velvety base patchouli tonka bean vanilla amber opening surprisingly cool spicy floral heart opens roses bloom becomes warm enticing compelling exquisitely confident unapologetically luxurious,"galbanum, bergamot, cardamom, rose, jasmine, incense, cinnamon, sandalwood, patchouli, vanilla, tonka bean, amber"
Tubereuse - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"When we think of tuberose in perfume, we often think of the version most perfumers like to emphasize: its nocturnal version, when it exudes its most intense scent. More discreet and docile during the day, the flower some call 'The Queen of the Night' emerges from its slumber when it's dark out to emit a deep and almost animalic aroma.
In Tubereuse, Mona di Orio creates what she calls a 'twilight tuberose, ' greener and fresher than its headier nocturnal incarnations but still intoxicating and rich. It opens with a beautiful and peppery burst of bergamot and green notes, which almost gives tuberose the quality of having been tamed and made more transparent after a refreshing light rain.
Soon, the unmistakably narcotic tuberose slinks its way forward, flanked by creamy notes from benzoin and amber matched with a milky nuttiness from heliotrope and coconut. Along with Tubereuse's top notes, the occasional sharp floral facet from heliotrope joins with tuberose's green facets, balancing out its creamy and musky base notes.
More approachable than its more femme fatale counterparts, Tubereuse nevertheless seduces. Perfect for tuberose fans that want a lighter, friendlier, more verdant interpretation of the flower.","pink pepper, bergamot, green leaves, tuberose absolute, benzoin, heliotrope, amber, coconut milk, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51719.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,think tuberose perfume often think version perfumers like emphasize nocturnal version exudes intense scent discreet docile day flower call 'the queen night' emerges slumber dark emit deep almost animalic aroma tubereuse mona di orio creates calls 'twilight tuberose ' greener fresher headier nocturnal incarnations still intoxicating rich opens beautiful peppery burst bergamot green notes almost gives tuberose quality tamed made transparent refreshing light rain soon unmistakably narcotic tuberose slinks way forward flanked creamy notes benzoin amber matched milky nuttiness heliotrope coconut along tubereuse's top notes occasional sharp floral facet heliotrope joins tuberose's green facets balancing creamy musky base notes approachable femme fatale counterparts tubereuse nevertheless seduces perfect tuberose fans want lighter friendlier verdant interpretation flower,"pink pepper, bergamot, green leaves, tuberose absolute, benzoin, heliotrope, amber, coconut milk, musk"
Vanille - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"When composing Vanille, Mona di Orio imagined a romantic back story involving an old ship from long ago, on its way to Madagascar or the Comoros Islands, carrying precious cargo: rum barrels, oranges, vanilla beans, ylang-ylang, cloves and sandalwood.
Gourmand, smoky, and boozy with a subtle aromatic orange note lingering in the background, Vanille is one Bateau Ivre of perfectly blended notes that will derange your senses with its sensuality.
Vanille opens with a shot of rum flavored with an orange rind and spiced with cloves. Amber and tonka further warm up this brew as ylang-ylang's sharp sweetness joins with rich vanilla. Gaiac wood adds incensey smoke as woody notes from vetiver and sandalwood help to create an elegant finish.
But the real star of the show, not surprisingly, is vanilla. Instead of using ethyl vanillin, one of vanilla's main components that can come across as powdery and sugary, Mona di Orio used pure vanilla in this elixir. For a moment â amid this elegant orchestral arrangement of notes in the key of Vanilla â the pulpy, sensual creaminess of a split vanilla bean is right there in front of your nose. Delicious!","orange, cloves, petit grain, rum extract, bourbon vetiver, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, gaiac wood, vanilla absolute, amber, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51720.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,composing vanille mona di orio imagined romantic back story involving old ship long ago way madagascar comoros islands carrying precious cargo rum barrels oranges vanilla beans ylang ylang cloves sandalwood gourmand smoky boozy subtle aromatic orange note lingering background vanille one bateau ivre perfectly blended notes derange senses sensuality vanille opens shot rum flavored orange rind spiced cloves amber tonka warm brew ylang ylang's sharp sweetness joins rich vanilla gaiac wood adds incensey smoke woody notes vetiver sandalwood help create elegant finish real star show surprisingly vanilla instead using ethyl vanillin one vanilla's main components come across powdery sugary mona di orio used pure vanilla elixir moment amid elegant orchestral arrangement notes key vanilla pulpy sensual creaminess split vanilla bean right front nose delicious,"orange, cloves, petit grain, rum extract, bourbon vetiver, ylang-ylang, sandalwood, gaiac wood, vanilla absolute, amber, tonka bean"
Vetyver - Les Nombres d'Or Eau de Parfum,Mona di Orio,"Vetiver is one of our favorite notes in perfume, and in Mona di Orio's Vetyver, she wrests every facet she can get from its earthy-citrus scent, like a pianist exploring the intricacies of a particular key in a Bach piano concerto. Fresh, dry, peppery, hesperidic and even minty â Vetyver marries the best Bourbon vetiver with notes that bring out its herbaceous-fresh qualities.
In the top notes, blue ginger from Madagascar â which Mona di Orio distinguishes from what she calls the dustier and drier Chinese ginger â creates the olfactory hallucination of having the fresh root under your nose. Virginia cedar and clary sage absolute add a slightly bitter, herbaceous accord with a momentary glint of mint.
Vetyver then creates a sleight-of-hand impression of both dryness and freshness, like freshly steeped spiced tea with grapefruit zest just beginning to release its oils. This hesperidic note, concentrated rather than juicy and sparkling, adds a lovely counterpoint to the subtle but rich tonka and labdanum, which add weight and roundness to the perfume.
Ginger and nutmeg become more prominent as the perfume progresses, and in its dry down, Vetyver's paradoxical freshness and dryness linger delicately on the skin. A perfect unisex scent for warm weather, Vetyver is a rarity: a clean scent that is also complex.","blue ginger, grapefruit, nutmeg, vetiver, ciste labdanum, musk, patchouli, absolute sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51721.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,vetiver one favorite notes perfume mona di orio's vetyver wrests every facet get earthy citrus scent like pianist exploring intricacies particular key bach piano concerto fresh dry peppery hesperidic even minty vetyver marries best bourbon vetiver notes bring herbaceous fresh qualities top notes blue ginger madagascar mona di orio distinguishes calls dustier drier chinese ginger creates olfactory hallucination fresh root nose virginia cedar clary sage absolute add slightly bitter herbaceous accord momentary glint mint vetyver creates sleight hand impression dryness freshness like freshly steeped spiced tea grapefruit zest beginning release oils hesperidic note concentrated rather juicy sparkling adds lovely counterpoint subtle rich tonka labdanum add weight roundness perfume ginger nutmeg become prominent perfume progresses dry vetyver's paradoxical freshness dryness linger delicately skin perfect unisex scent warm weather vetyver rarity clean scent also complex,"blue ginger, grapefruit, nutmeg, vetiver, ciste labdanum, musk, patchouli, absolute sage"
Dark Aoud Eau de Parfum,Montale,"Experiencing Dark Aoud by Montale in its initial stages is akin to walking into a pitch-black room. Just as it takes a while for your eyes to adjust in order to discern the shapes, sizes, and nuances of the objects initially hidden in darkness, so too does it take time to realize that Dark Oud is more than a linear oud.
A minimalist exploration of two powerful accords â oud and sandalwood â Dark Aoud starts out with the smoky, camphoraceous, medicinal aspect of oud on display, accompanied by a dry and elegant sandalwood. A sweeter, softer, and rounder sandalwood comes forth from its initial asceticism, rounding out the oud note's inky darkness and revealing its soft, even powdery spiciness. Although Dark Aoud gets softer through its long dry down, it remains an intense and mysterious presence on your skin.","sandalwood, oud, black pepper, saffron, vetiver, teak, leather, grey amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35467.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,experiencing dark aoud montale initial stages akin walking pitch black room takes eyes adjust order discern shapes sizes nuances objects initially hidden darkness take time realize dark oud linear oud minimalist exploration two powerful accords oud sandalwood dark aoud starts smoky camphoraceous medicinal aspect oud display accompanied dry elegant sandalwood sweeter softer rounder sandalwood comes forth initial asceticism rounding oud note's inky darkness revealing soft even powdery spiciness although dark aoud gets softer long dry remains intense mysterious presence skin,"sandalwood, oud, black pepper, saffron, vetiver, teak, leather, grey amber"

Pure eVe Eau de Parfum,The Different Company,"Very simple and utterly beautiful. The inspiration for Pure Virgin was to create something as luxurious, comfortable and effortless as a soft cotton white shirt. It's a given that the simpler the design, the more the quality of the materials matters, and it is the outstanding quality of the ingredients that The Different Company uses that makes this simple concept soar. An exquisite gentle musk is blended with a subtle hint of white flowers and crisp cedarwood, then dusted with a nostalgic sweetness of calisson -- a traditional French candy from Provence featuring a smooth paste of candied melon and ground almonds, topped with white royal icing.

Love Eau de Parfum,By Kilian,"Kilian says the inspiration of Love (Don't Be Shy) was the marshmallow...a mouth watering treat for sensuous connoisseurs. It's sweet (but not overly) and tender at first, a soft and sugared elixir mixed with the orangey delights of bergamot and neroli, warmed with caramel and vanilla. It's almost nostalgic in some way...not an old fashioned feel but more like youthful exuberance which gains a gentle sensuality as it warms on the skin and the rose, jasmine and sweet notes combine. Love captures that sweet transition from innocence to worldly, but it never crosses the line into beat-you-over-the-head sexy territory. It's a memory scent, somewhere between a young girl's unicorn, rainbows and purple phase and her door slamming, love struck tirades...right in-between innocence and not.","bergamot , neroli, pink pepper berries, coriander, honeysuckle, orange flower, orange water, jasmine absolute, rose, iris butter absolute, caramelized sugar, vanilla absolute, labdanum, white musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/42500.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kilian says inspiration love shy marshmallow mouth watering treat sensuous connoisseurs sweet overly tender first soft sugared elixir mixed orangey delights bergamot neroli warmed caramel vanilla almost nostalgic way old fashioned feel like youthful exuberance gains gentle sensuality warms skin rose jasmine sweet notes combine love captures sweet transition innocence worldly never crosses line beat head sexy territory memory scent somewhere young girl's unicorn rainbows purple phase door slamming love struck tirades right innocence,"bergamot , neroli, pink pepper berries, coriander, honeysuckle, orange flower, orange water, jasmine absolute, rose, iris butter absolute, caramelized sugar, vanilla absolute, labdanum, white musk"

Week-end Eau de Toilette,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Previously called Week-end a Deauville Week-end is a song of freshness. A chic but relaxed style. Week-end is composed of tender herbs mixed with peppermint, sweet basil and tarragon, which provide a floral note with strong tones of lily of the valley â at least, what is left of it, because lily of the valley, from which no natural essence can be extracted, is sorely tested in the production of scents. Not a day passes but legislation limits still further the molecules that can be used to recreate it. It's goodbye to Lilial, Lyral, Hydroxy and sweet bell-flowers! So I called upon Jasmin absolute, supreme of Ylang and resin of Galbanum to sustain the lily of the valley. A hint of apple and cardamom to invoke deepest Normandy. Helional and calone, more recent essences, recall the sea air of the coast. A touch of leather is a nod to the Norman stud farms. Cedarwood and white musk complete the picture.

Versilia Vintage Ambra Mediterranea Eau de Parfum,Profumi del Forte,"It was in the Sixties. During the summer I took a quiet ferry toward the islands of the archipelago. They were short trips in the search of those magnificent, solitary places set in the blue Tyrrhenian sea. In the small harbours, echos of fantastic stories, tales of distant lands, of flowers and perfumes; and merchandise of rich colours, of every kind and from every place. Then my journey continued on in my imagination, beyond the seas and the oceans, veering off through dream and discovery. They were the years of the New Frontier.

Battito d'ali Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Battito d'ali means 'the beating of wings' and implies an elusive, fragile quality â the delicate fluttering of a passing butterfly, or, in this case â angels hovering nearby. creating a magical fleeting moment of feeling protected and cherished and free of worries. Opening with a strong dose of myrrh, this initially seems very human - sharp and vaguely medicinal. Then the heart piercing radiance of ethereal orange blossom lifts us up and a delicate dusting of soft cocoa powder and sweet, gentle vanilla blend with the myrrh to create something heavenly. This is powdery and gorgeous â the gourmand notes are handled with a light hand and meld with the other elements without dominating them. This does not seem like eating a cake, but rather like passing by a room where many cakes have been baked and the sweetness has become part of the air itself. If you could wrap that air around you like a cozy blanket to fend off melancholy, it would be like wearing this exquisite scent. No one knows what angels smell like, of course - and we imagine that everyone's angel would be scented differently â but the angels in our dreams will now smell like this -- dreamy, otherworldly and infinitely comforting.","cocoa poudre, orange blossom, myrrh, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33930.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,battito d'ali means 'the beating wings' implies elusive fragile quality delicate fluttering passing butterfly case angels hovering nearby creating magical fleeting moment feeling protected cherished free worries opening strong dose myrrh initially seems human sharp vaguely medicinal heart piercing radiance ethereal orange blossom lifts us delicate dusting soft cocoa powder sweet gentle vanilla blend myrrh create something heavenly powdery gorgeous gourmand notes handled light hand meld elements without dominating seem like eating cake rather like passing room many cakes baked sweetness become part air could wrap air around like cozy blanket fend melancholy would like wearing exquisite scent one knows angels smell like course imagine everyone's angel would scented differently angels dreams smell like dreamy otherworldly infinitely comforting,"cocoa poudre, orange blossom, myrrh, vanilla"
Arso Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"The sharp, evocative scent of wood smoke - triggering childhood memories of bonfires and burning leaves - is at the heart of this eloquent scent. Arso means 'burned' and the masterfully rendered smokiness works with the crisp cool scent of pine to conjure up a cabin in winter, with a crackling fire on the hearth. You can sense the snow piling up outside, the ice on the windowpanes, the wildness of the forest and the chill kept at bay by the blaze, but you also get the warm indoor scents of well-worn leather and glowing incense, as well as the fire. The mood is calm and comfortable and safe â sitting with a glass of wine and good company while the winds howl outside. This is perfectly suited for the strong, silent type - the sort of man who could build a house single-handedly and maybe even chop down the trees to build all by himself.

Fougere Royale Eau de Parfum,Houbigant,"First introduced in 1882, fougere Royale completely revolutionized the world of perfumes and established modern perfumery as we know it today. fougere Royale was the first 'fougere' (or fern-like) perfume ever created, and it established a completely new fragrance family, which remains the most popular one in men's fragrances.
fougere Royale opens with an uplifting cocktail of sparkling citrus oils, blending into an aromatic bouquet of Mediterranean herbs, where lavender and Moroccan chamomile oil dictate a buoyant tempo. A redolent heart follows, wherein a floral-spicy ""Rondeletia"" accord is revealed through rich geranium nuances and warm spices. A floral intermezzo showcases rare rose essences and absolutes, spiked with pepper, cinnamon and carnation. Finally, a grand finale of earthy, ambery and woody harmonies, with moss notes joining a sensual patchouli theme enriched by warm coumarinic undertones of tonka beans and clary sage absolute, conclude the aromatic symphony.","bergamot, mediterranean herbs, lavender, chamomile, rondeletia, geranium, rose de mai, cinnamon, carnation, amber, oakmoss, patchouli, tonka bean, clary sage",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/53400.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first introduced fougere royale completely revolutionized world perfumes established modern perfumery know today fougere royale first 'fougere' fern like perfume ever created established completely new fragrance family remains popular one men's fragrances fougere royale opens uplifting cocktail sparkling citrus oils blending aromatic bouquet mediterranean herbs lavender moroccan chamomile oil dictate buoyant tempo redolent heart follows wherein floral spicy rondeletia accord revealed rich geranium nuances warm spices floral intermezzo showcases rare rose essences absolutes spiked pepper cinnamon carnation finally grand finale earthy ambery woody harmonies moss notes joining sensual patchouli theme enriched warm coumarinic undertones tonka beans clary sage absolute conclude aromatic symphony,"bergamot, mediterranean herbs, lavender, chamomile, rondeletia, geranium, rose de mai, cinnamon, carnation, amber, oakmoss, patchouli, tonka bean, clary sage"
La Belle Helene Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Osmanthus is one of the most unusual floral essences in the perfumer's palette, barely a flower really, but an oddly compelling hybrid of fruit and animal with its jammy apricot and soft leather facets. And for Parfums MDCI's 10th fragrance, Bertrand Duchaufour has brought out its beauty with two lightly gourmand accords. The name comes from by the classic French dessert Pears Belle-Helene, invented in the late 19th century by Auguste Escoffier, the first celebrity chef and named after Offenbach's 1864 operetta, a risque spoof on the abduction of Helen of Troy. Of the poached pears, chocolate sauce, vanilla ice cream and crystallized violets, the perfumer has only kept the pear -- a vivid, juicy pear adding its green, rosy and musky notes to the apricot in top and heart, underlined by a zest of tangerine. The powdery woodiness of violets, another facet of osmanthus, are boosted by pure orris butter and balanced out by their classic partner, rose; ylang ylang adds contrast and a rich floral fleshiness. The leather in the osmanthus is drawn out in the heart and anchored to the base by a burnt sweet, woody licorice accord.
With its drop of citrus, rose and vetiver, patchouli and oak moss base, La Belle Helene is also, essentially, a chypre â the third in MDCI's line-up. But it is decidedly a non-classic chypre, silky, musky, juicy and light-hearted: in fact, like its namesake 'the beautiful Helen', it is quite the charmer. And like Escoffier's culinary classic, it's almost impossible not to bite into.","pear accord, aldehydes, tangerine, lime blossom, rose essence, osmanthus absolute, ylang-ylang, orris butter, hawthorn, mirabelle plum, myrrh, vetiver, patchouli, cedar, amber, oak moss absolute, white musk, sandalwood, licorice wood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36511.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,osmanthus one unusual floral essences perfumer's palette barely flower really oddly compelling hybrid fruit animal jammy apricot soft leather facets parfums mdci's th fragrance bertrand duchaufour brought beauty two lightly gourmand accords name comes classic french dessert pears belle helene invented late th century auguste escoffier first celebrity chef named offenbach's operetta risque spoof abduction helen troy poached pears chocolate sauce vanilla ice cream crystallized violets perfumer kept pear vivid juicy pear adding green rosy musky notes apricot top heart underlined zest tangerine powdery woodiness violets another facet osmanthus boosted pure orris butter balanced classic partner rose ylang ylang adds contrast rich floral fleshiness leather osmanthus drawn heart anchored base burnt sweet woody licorice accord drop citrus rose vetiver patchouli oak moss base la belle helene also essentially chypre third mdci's line decidedly non classic chypre silky musky juicy light hearted fact like namesake 'the beautiful helen' quite charmer like escoffier's culinary classic almost impossible bite,"pear accord, aldehydes, tangerine, lime blossom, rose essence, osmanthus absolute, ylang-ylang, orris butter, hawthorn, mirabelle plum, myrrh, vetiver, patchouli, cedar, amber, oak moss absolute, white musk, sandalwood, licorice wood"

Vanille Insensee Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne,"A deep, intense vanilla infused with wild, forest air. The opening is bright and invigorating, a delightful amouse-bouche of zesty lime and citron spiked with a delicious dose of coriander before the main course of rich, robust vanilla.

The vanilla is laced with a fresh woodsiness â not just wood itself, but the whole sense of the forest - the crisp air, the layer of pine needles and leaves covering the earth and the rich earth, itself. Jasmine, oakmoss, oak wood and vetiver are expertly blended to give freshness and texture to the vanilla, and additional richness comes from the luscious amber which rounds out the fragrance. It does not feel like the elements are layered on top of each other, but fused seamlessly together, like someone discovered an enchanted vanilla forest and simply bottled the essence of it.

Two Eau de Toilette,Knize,"A floral addition to the Knize family, Knize Two, created in 1978, is a fresh floral chypre with a beautiful, cut violet-leaf note singing in its heart.

It opens with a green and slightly soapy accord offset by bitter-fresh galbanum and petitgrain, all of which is sharpened with bergamot and lemon. A subtle fruit note adds warmth to Knize Two's radiant florals, among them rose, jasmine, and carnation. Its woody/mossy drydown â with cedarwood, sandalwood, and musk â gives scratchy texture to the smooth and subtley lingering florals that shine through the base.

1681 Eau de Parfum,Carthusia,"""The island of Capri in 1681. Under the reign of Charles II of Spain and the Bishop of Anacapri, fatalism, battles, brutal pirate attacks and intrigues within the church dominate everyday life. And yet, in the newly re-opened Carthusian monastery, germinate the seeds of a significant new era.""
In 1681, shortly after the reconstruction of the local monastery, the Carthusian monks of Capri began with the production of scented water which they create using the help of herbs and spices from the local environs. Tradition, craftsmanship, and natural processing play a central role in the fragrances which are based, even to this day, on essences and aromas from this idyllic Mediterranean island.
Unique values flow into the new composition of Carthusia and unite with a variety of intensive and iridescent impressions: 1681 a multi-faceted fragrance of exquisite complexity. This extremely elegant and distinctive fragrance opens with top notes of mandarin, bergamot and rosemary. The heart of lavender and black pepper flows slowly into a base of long-lasting incense and cedar.
1681 possesses great appeal and fascinates with its soft intensity. The symbolic name enshrines itself in the mind and leaves an indelible mark that only a fragrance with a glorious past can become a real classic.","tangerine, bergamot, coriander, thyme, rosemary, iris, neroli, lavender, petitgrain, black pepper, sandalwood, cedarwood, frankincense, ambergris, vanilla, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52911.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,island capri reign charles ii spain bishop anacapri fatalism battles brutal pirate attacks intrigues within church dominate everyday life yet newly opened carthusian monastery germinate seeds significant new era shortly reconstruction local monastery carthusian monks capri began production scented water create using help herbs spices local environs tradition craftsmanship natural processing play central role fragrances based even day essences aromas idyllic mediterranean island unique values flow new composition carthusia unite variety intensive iridescent impressions multi faceted fragrance exquisite complexity extremely elegant distinctive fragrance opens top notes mandarin bergamot rosemary heart lavender black pepper flows slowly base long lasting incense cedar possesses great appeal fascinates soft intensity symbolic name enshrines mind leaves indelible mark fragrance glorious past become real classic,"tangerine, bergamot, coriander, thyme, rosemary, iris, neroli, lavender, petitgrain, black pepper, sandalwood, cedarwood, frankincense, ambergris, vanilla, musk"
Craft Eau De Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums,"In the beginning, this is as sleek and impervious as the hideout of a Bond supervillian. Sharp aldehydes and frozen metal offer a chilly sophistication that feels like it's from a glossy version of the future that includes jet packs and robot valets. But under the slick ice is a warm and woody heart just waiting for the thaw - a blend of resinous elemi, earthy patchouli and robust cedar. The elemi note is particularly vivid -- this unique incense note has a clarifying briskness with undertones of fresh citrus and a hint of salt. The energizing incense and the cool metallic bite play together unexpectedly well, and what begins as a novelty evolves into a surprisingly wearable scent that has a wonderful balance of cool and warm that keeps it dynamic. A must-try for incense fans and for anyone who loves unusual fragrances.","aldehydes, elemi, cold metal, ice, cedar wood, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52800.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,beginning sleek impervious hideout bond supervillian sharp aldehydes frozen metal offer chilly sophistication feels like glossy version future includes jet packs robot valets slick ice warm woody heart waiting thaw blend resinous elemi earthy patchouli robust cedar elemi note particularly vivid unique incense note clarifying briskness undertones fresh citrus hint salt energizing incense cool metallic bite play together unexpectedly well begins novelty evolves surprisingly wearable scent wonderful balance cool warm keeps dynamic must try incense fans anyone loves unusual fragrances,"aldehydes, elemi, cold metal, ice, cedar wood, patchouli"
Smart Eau de Parfum,Andrea Maack Parfums,"Take a luxurious line-up of sultry heavy-hitters â heady jasmine, luscious vanilla, exotic sandalwood and creamy musk - and blend them carefully with a supple buckskin leather note and what do you get?

Knize Ten Eau de Toilette,Knize,"Joseph Knize, one of its inventors lived in Vienna and was a supplier to the Royal and Imperial Court. The fragrance we offer, Knize Ten, has been available since 1925. The great author Hans Habe once said that, if he were cast away on a desert island, he would take Knize with him, since, for a man using a toilet water, it was really not so much a matter of undermining the morale of a beautiful woman than boosting one's own. The brilliant designer and poster artist Ernst Deutsch-Dryden played a decisive role in the composition of Knize. Knize was the most famous men's outfitter in Vienna. His shop still exists today with a much-admired interior, one of the great works of the architect and designer Adolf Loos. Knize Ten is one of the few fragrances to have distinct note of leather. Perfumers, who are capable of lyricism equal to that of wine connoisseurs, differentiate between the top, heart and base note of a fragrance and sense chords and cadences in the combination of these three. The top note of Knize is citrus-fresh with petitgrain, orange, rosemary and bergamot; the heart note is dry to woody with cedars and sandalwood, and the base note is leathery with castor and ambergris. In view of its age, Knize is not, of course, a fully synthetic perfume. It contains costly natural substances - patchouli wood, lemon, orris, clove and orange blossom amongst others.","lemon, bergamot, orange, petitgrain, rosemary, geranium, rose, cedar, orris, carnation, cinnamon, orange blossom, sandalwood, leather, musk, moss, patchouli, ambergris, castoreum vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/52700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,joseph knize one inventors lived vienna supplier royal imperial court fragrance offer knize ten available since great author hans habe said cast away desert island would take knize since man using toilet water really much matter undermining morale beautiful woman boosting one's brilliant designer poster artist ernst deutsch dryden played decisive role composition knize knize famous men's outfitter vienna shop still exists today much admired interior one great works architect designer adolf loos knize ten one fragrances distinct note leather perfumers capable lyricism equal wine connoisseurs differentiate top heart base note fragrance sense chords cadences combination three top note knize citrus fresh petitgrain orange rosemary bergamot heart note dry woody cedars sandalwood base note leathery castor ambergris view age knize course fully synthetic perfume contains costly natural substances patchouli wood lemon orris clove orange blossom amongst others,"lemon, bergamot, orange, petitgrain, rosemary, geranium, rose, cedar, orris, carnation, cinnamon, orange blossom, sandalwood, leather, musk, moss, patchouli, ambergris, castoreum vanilla"
De Bachmakov Eau de Parfum,The Different Company,"In a tribute to his Russian ancestry and to celebrate the year of Russia in France, the Different Company's co-founder (with Jean-Claude Ellena) and renowned designer Thierry de Baschmakoff joined forces with the perfumer Celine Ellena to compose the fragrance which bears his name. De Bachmakov is not a literal evocation of Russia, but a poetic fugue on the magical moment when snow begins to melt on the steppes and the earth gives way to the rites of spring; on the first rays of sun to touch the Siberian forests swept by winds from Asia. The fragrance is as limpid and bracing as a shot of ice-cold vodka: along with peppery, aromatic bergamot, the lemony, anise-tinged shiso leaves and tangy, zesty cilantro lend their green, aldehydic fizziness to the blend, sweetened by a sprinkle of nutmeg. Freesia and its tender, white floral notes add a jasmine richness to the heart: as the fragrance evolves, its limpidity gives way to a surprising chalk accord produced by a blend of woody notes and musk. De Bachmakov is sap and snow and the first spring flowers: a cool herbal potion brewed near the Arctic Circle. It is also the very gifted Celine Ellena's last composition for The Different Company: all the more reason to snap up this gorgeous and truly unique fragrance.","cedar wood, bergamot, shiso leaves, nutmeg, coriander leaves, white freesia, soft chalk accord",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25325.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tribute russian ancestry celebrate year russia france different company's co founder jean claude ellena renowned designer thierry de baschmakoff joined forces perfumer celine ellena compose fragrance bears name de bachmakov literal evocation russia poetic fugue magical moment snow begins melt steppes earth gives way rites spring first rays sun touch siberian forests swept winds asia fragrance limpid bracing shot ice cold vodka along peppery aromatic bergamot lemony anise tinged shiso leaves tangy zesty cilantro lend green aldehydic fizziness blend sweetened sprinkle nutmeg freesia tender white floral notes add jasmine richness heart fragrance evolves limpidity gives way surprising chalk accord produced blend woody notes musk de bachmakov sap snow first spring flowers cool herbal potion brewed near arctic circle also gifted celine ellena's last composition different company reason snap gorgeous truly unique fragrance,"cedar wood, bergamot, shiso leaves, nutmeg, coriander leaves, white freesia, soft chalk accord"
Pink Quartz Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"A fundamental stone of universal love and of infinite compassion: compassion towards oneself and towards the Other. The Pink Quartz is linked to heart ""chakra"". It opens on dreams; it is inspiring, leading to the source of inner peace, of absolute calm and happiness.'
These are the words Olivier Durbano wrote to describe his inspiration for his ode to the symbolism of pink quartz, the rare and light-sensitive crystalline form of rose quartz. Rose is naturally the star ingredient here, a bright, fulsome one that is brought to bursting life in the opening by citrus, saffron and ginger and warmed at its heart with amber, patchouli and musk. Heading into Fall and Winter we can see us keeping this love letter to the most perfect summer near to hand at all times. It's as beautiful as a perfect Technicolor rose garden, it's as calming as a hammock lazily swaying in the summer breeze. It's a lifeline during stressful times and drab, short grey days to a place where the sun shines warmly on your face and all is right with the world.
'From the stone to the flower, a love ritual of healing, a sacred procession, a conversion ceremony leading to such essential qualifies as purity, spirituality and compassion. The rose remains a powerful symbol at the crossroads of our human emotions. The rose represents the dawn of a new era to be reinvented by all human souls together.'

Sartorial Eau de Toilette,Penhaligons,"After offering the masterfully sensuous Amaranthine last year to the ladies, Penhaligon's, as befits a traditional English house, has turned its attention to gentlemen. As an inspiration for Sartorial, Bertrand Duchaufour launched into an olfactory exploration of the Savile Row bespoke tailor Norton & Son's workshop. The odorant threads he's teased out compose a radically new vision of the most traditional masculine fragrance family, the fougere. Lavender acts as a reference both to the fougere and to a typically English scent. Boosted by aldehydes and ozonic materials, it conjures the steam rising from hot irons on tweeds â fear not, there isn't the least hint of the aquatic in the blend --, the scissors and sewing machines. The dusty leather of club chairs and mounted hunting trophies springs from the combination of black pepper, gurjum wood, oakmoss and a leather accord. Patchouli and cedar rubbed in beeswax and honey soften the hard edges of the leather and metallic effects and smoothly wrap the blend, just as the waxed floors and cupboards bathe the tailor's shop in a warm, fatty-animalic glow. Duchaufour aficionados may recognize a trace of that signature green pepper note he's dropped into many of his compositions.
As the quintessential English dandy and couturier to the Queen Hardy Amies once said: 'A man should look as if he bought his clothes with intelligence, put them on with care, then forgot about them.' That's Sartorial: tough and smooth, playful and elegant, impeccably tailored and as easy to wear as a bespoke suit.","aldehydes, ozonic effect, metallic effect, violet leaf, neroli, cardamom, black pepper, fresh ginger, beeswax, cyclamen, linden blossom, lavender, leather, gurjum wood, patchouli, myrrh, cedar wood, tonka bean, oakmoss, white musk, honey effect, old wood effect, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/44147.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,offering masterfully sensuous amaranthine last year ladies penhaligon's befits traditional english house turned attention gentlemen inspiration sartorial bertrand duchaufour launched olfactory exploration savile row bespoke tailor norton son's workshop odorant threads he's teased compose radically new vision traditional masculine fragrance family fougere lavender acts reference fougere typically english scent boosted aldehydes ozonic materials conjures steam rising hot irons tweeds fear least hint aquatic blend scissors sewing machines dusty leather club chairs mounted hunting trophies springs combination black pepper gurjum wood oakmoss leather accord patchouli cedar rubbed beeswax honey soften hard edges leather metallic effects smoothly wrap blend waxed floors cupboards bathe tailor's shop warm fatty animalic glow duchaufour aficionados may recognize trace signature green pepper note he's dropped many compositions quintessential english dandy couturier queen hardy amies said 'a man look bought clothes intelligence put care forgot ' that's sartorial tough smooth playful elegant impeccably tailored easy wear bespoke suit,"aldehydes, ozonic effect, metallic effect, violet leaf, neroli, cardamom, black pepper, fresh ginger, beeswax, cyclamen, linden blossom, lavender, leather, gurjum wood, patchouli, myrrh, cedar wood, tonka bean, oakmoss, white musk, honey effect, old wood effect, vanilla, amber"
Memoir Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"The releases from the house of Amouage over the past three years have had a uniting thread: uncomporomised richness and beauty. Their new series Memoir presents a new chapter in this narrative as conceived by Creative Director, Christopher Chong. Turning the industry norm of a dominant woman's fragrance on its head, Chong instead conceived the two Memoir fragrances from an inherently male point of view. Together, the Memoir fragrances offer a new interpretation of the 'space' between man and woman, one that is almost impossible to resist.
Memoir Man is a fougere, one that fractures the standard mix of Lavender and Oakmoss into bright shards by the addition of Basil and Mint and the further aspect of Absinth. Like a tray of unset gems the topnotes sparkle on the skin, leading into heart notes of Woods and a rich, smooth base of Vanilla, Amber and the traditional Oakmoss. Inspired by Baudelaire's fleÂneur who walked the city in order to experience it, the scent brings to mind the richness that is Paris. As the ""Gentleman stroller"" he is a living duality: both observer and observed, spectator and participant. Won't you take his hand?","basil, mint, frankincense, lavender, rose, oakmoss, leather, tobacco, absinthe, wormwood, sandalwood, guaiac wood, vanilla, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41835.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,releases house amouage past three years uniting thread uncomporomised richness beauty new series memoir presents new chapter narrative conceived creative director christopher chong turning industry norm dominant woman's fragrance head chong instead conceived two memoir fragrances inherently male point view together memoir fragrances offer new interpretation 'space' man woman one almost impossible resist memoir man fougere one fractures standard mix lavender oakmoss bright shards addition basil mint aspect absinth like tray unset gems topnotes sparkle skin leading heart notes woods rich smooth base vanilla amber traditional oakmoss inspired baudelaire's fle neur walked city order experience scent brings mind richness paris gentleman stroller living duality observer observed spectator participant take hand,"basil, mint, frankincense, lavender, rose, oakmoss, leather, tobacco, absinthe, wormwood, sandalwood, guaiac wood, vanilla, amber"
Une Rose Vermeille Eau de Parfum,Tauer Perfumes,"A divinely saucy rose scent that flounces and shimmies and flirts its way into your heart and never lets you go. The opening is bright and juicy citrus with a hint of lavender â and then the vermillion rose unfurls its luscious petals. As you would expect from Andy Tauer, the rose is exceptionally vivid and true â deep and velvety and spicy, with a peppery bite that acts as the perfect foil to a delicious, intensely concentrated essence of raspberry. This is a raspberry that you would pick in a dream â the most perfect berry of the summer - so bright and pure and sweet that you would cry if you woke up before tasting another. The sparkling rose and raspberry jam is folded into a creamy base of vanilla, tonka bean and smooth sandalwood, taking us right to the brink of gourmand, but not quite crossing over. There is definitely an edible quality to Une Rose Vermeille â it conjures up marzipan and meringue and Bavarian cream â but it isn't pure dessert due to the startling freshness of the rose and the deep purr of the sandalwood. This rose is not just charming and delectable and adorably feminine, but a bit naughty, as well.

It opens with a piquant, shimmering yuzu note â similar to that of grapefruit with overtones of Mandarin orange. The vibrant yuzu leads us like a colorful butterfly to an ethereal garden of rose japonica and dreamy jasmine.

Uden Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"Xerjoff classifies Uden as a marine fougere, meaning that it smells of lavender, oak moss, and the sea. To us, although accurate in some ways, it simplifies Uden's unique complexity. If Uden is a marine scent, then its waters surround the Bahamas, where ancient traders traveled weeks across the treacherous Atlantic to barter for coffee and rum, both of which give Uden a delicious warmth. The rum and coffee are then packed in rough wood crates, which pick up the salty scent of the ocean as the boat's wooden timbers rock on the waves for further journey in the New World. Uden's ocean is the world of the seamen who risked their lives traversing the seas to bring the pleasure of the exotic to long ago drawing rooms.
Uden opens with lavender and citrus, the harbingers of a traditional fougere. However, instead of traveling the clean, smooth path for which it seems destined, coffee and rum absolutes add their familiar, delicious notes. Combined with Uden's opening, the coffee and rum create an unfamiliar--yet completely tantalizing--heart to the fragrance. Uden dries down into a warm medley of wood infused with clean musk, providing a counterpoint to its sweet rum, rich coffee, and crisp citrus-lavender. Uden reminds us that wild worlds may belie the simplest pleasures.","grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51105.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,xerjoff classifies uden marine fougere meaning smells lavender oak moss sea us although accurate ways simplifies uden's unique complexity uden marine scent waters surround bahamas ancient traders traveled weeks across treacherous atlantic barter coffee rum give uden delicious warmth rum coffee packed rough wood crates pick salty scent ocean boat's wooden timbers rock waves journey new world uden's ocean world seamen risked lives traversing seas bring pleasure exotic long ago drawing rooms uden opens lavender citrus harbingers traditional fougere however instead traveling clean smooth path seems destined coffee rum absolutes add familiar delicious notes combined uden's opening coffee rum create unfamiliar yet completely tantalizing heart fragrance uden dries warm medley wood infused clean musk providing counterpoint sweet rum rich coffee crisp citrus lavender uden reminds us wild worlds may belie simplest pleasures,"grapefruit, lemon, rum absolute, rose, sandalwood, gaiac wood, vanilla, coffee absolute, musk"
Kobe Eau de Parfum,Xerjoff,"In Kobe, Xerjoff created something unusual, yet somehow inevitable: a dry citrus, warm woody fragrance for men. Kobe smells like a finely crafted wooden box full of vividly scented citrus rinds. The wood of the box is of the best quality and from a mix of exotic trees, and the citrus peels inside are remarkably potent, but play more as spice than fruit. This marriage of tart and spicy with sweet and warm is what makes Kobe such a singular fragrance.
Kobe opens with a bracing grapefruit rind note rounded out with petitgrain (an oil extracted from the green twigs of the bitter orange) and bright neroli. It feels fresh and alive, like opening a window on a crisp morning to an orange grove in early spring just as tight blossoms begin to push from the orange trees. After a few minutes, green wood begins to join the sharp citrus. The wood seems to age and sweeten over time to become more resinous and balsamic, transforming Kobe into an extraordinary, deep woody scent. It isn't just any wood, though. A vein of oud, an unusual, intimate aroma, runs through the fragrance of shaved rose wood. Fresh and warm, sweet and tart, Kobe is a fragrance for any time and anywhere.","bergamot, orange, neroli, petitgrain, rose wood, resins, oud wood, palisander, tonka, amber",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/51107.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,kobe xerjoff created something unusual yet somehow inevitable dry citrus warm woody fragrance men kobe smells like finely crafted wooden box full vividly scented citrus rinds wood box best quality mix exotic trees citrus peels inside remarkably potent play spice fruit marriage tart spicy sweet warm makes kobe singular fragrance kobe opens bracing grapefruit rind note rounded petitgrain oil extracted green twigs bitter orange bright neroli feels fresh alive like opening window crisp morning orange grove early spring tight blossoms begin push orange trees minutes green wood begins join sharp citrus wood seems age sweeten time become resinous balsamic transforming kobe extraordinary deep woody scent wood though vein oud unusual intimate aroma runs fragrance shaved rose wood fresh warm sweet tart kobe fragrance time anywhere,"bergamot, orange, neroli, petitgrain, rose wood, resins, oud wood, palisander, tonka, amber"
Oranges and Lemons Say The Bells of St. Clements Eau de Parfum,HEELEY,"A traditional Eau de Cologne reworked to create a fresh, chic and contemporary, Eau de Parfum whose name is taken from the rhyme 'Oranges and Lemons' (circa 1740) that refers to church bells located within or near the City of London.

Ginger Ciao Eau de Parfum,YOSH,"Who is Ginger Ciao? Vivacious woman about town? Daring international spy? Charming seductress of rock stars and heads of state? Whoever she is, if she smells like this, she can get whatever she wants. Deep, sexy, to-die-for black coconut is the star of this fragrance, adeptly blended with lush night queen, tiger lily, neroli and a splash of ginger and basil.

Bois Naufrage Eau de Toilette,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","In French, bois flotte is driftwood, buffed to silkiness by the sea; naufrage is shipwrecked. Pierre Guillaume's unusual inspiration for his new scent is a black and white picture by the legendary Arles photographer Lucien Clergue. In the 1971 'Nu au bois flotte' female flesh and driftwood mingle until their smooth curves form a visual continuum. In Bois Naufrage, green and salty notes â one vegetal, the other mineral -- echo the memory of the sea that smoothed the wood, while the suave seawater facets of ambergris conjure sun-kissed skin, with a hint of tanning lotion washed away by a swim. Born in the wilds of the Camargue where carob trees grow and flamingos come to roost near salt marshes along miles of deserted Mediterranean beaches, Bois Naufrage offers an entirely new take on beach scents: mineral, vegetal, animal, as warm as the sand and as cool as the waves.","fig tree, ambergris, fleur de sel accord (vetiver oil fraction, orris absolute, mint, neroli oil, hedione)",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34537.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,french bois flotte driftwood buffed silkiness sea naufrage shipwrecked pierre guillaume's unusual inspiration new scent black white picture legendary arles photographer lucien clergue 'nu au bois flotte' female flesh driftwood mingle smooth curves form visual continuum bois naufrage green salty notes one vegetal mineral echo memory sea smoothed wood suave seawater facets ambergris conjure sun kissed skin hint tanning lotion washed away swim born wilds camargue carob trees grow flamingos come roost near salt marshes along miles deserted mediterranean beaches bois naufrage offers entirely new take beach scents mineral vegetal animal warm sand cool waves,"fig tree, ambergris, fleur de sel accord (vetiver oil fraction, orris absolute, mint, neroli oil, hedione)"
Vetyverio Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"The core of Vetyverio features two of the vetiver's amazing properties. The first, from Indonesia, is earthy, rough and splendidly reminiscent of unspoiled nature. The second is more subtle and delicate and hails from the Caribbean. Less known? No longer! This vetiver from Haiti is the perfect blend for the musks that cut through the formula: it completes it, tempers it, and adds a new â and remarkable â quality to it.
These essences are distilled by the two systems â steam and fractional distillation â and add up to almost an overdose (25% of the total), which avoids intensifying the blend with synthetic input. At the end, a few spices â carrot seeds with sparkling apricot essence, nutmeg and clove â add the last surprise. The majestic cedar wood's radical dryness structures the whole effect and the powdery musk draws a nothing but sensual line on the skin.
Vetyverio is subtle, sensitive, and captures the power of unquestionable elegance.","mandarin orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, vetiver, carrot seed, apricot, nutmeg, clove, ylang-ylang, rose, geranium, cedarwood, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48397.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,core vetyverio features two vetiver's amazing properties first indonesia earthy rough splendidly reminiscent unspoiled nature second subtle delicate hails caribbean less known longer vetiver haiti perfect blend musks cut formula completes tempers adds new remarkable quality essences distilled two systems steam fractional distillation add almost overdose total avoids intensifying blend synthetic input end spices carrot seeds sparkling apricot essence nutmeg clove add last surprise majestic cedar wood's radical dryness structures whole effect powdery musk draws nothing sensual line skin vetyverio subtle sensitive captures power unquestionable elegance,"mandarin orange, grapefruit, lemon, bergamot, vetiver, carrot seed, apricot, nutmeg, clove, ylang-ylang, rose, geranium, cedarwood, musk"

As neroli lovers know, quality is everything with this note, and this features a particularly beautiful neroli, introduced with bright lemon and bergamot and given a warm, sensuous glow with touches of amber and vanilla.

Bois Blonds Cologne Absolue,Atelier Cologne,"Bois Blonds opens just as we expect a cologne should, with an effervescent citrus and a hint of prickliness from the pink pepper. Then a swirl of mysterious incense and sensuous neroli beckons us, coaxing us to go further and before we know it we are off the traditional path and exploring uncharted territory. Soft woods and vetiver create a crisp, wild freshness like a clearing in the deep forest â the trees, the earth, a sprinkle of snow that is melting as the sun intensifies. Sophisticated and complex, the bewitching interplay of warm and cool, sun and shadow keeps us intrigued and coming back for more, like the memory of an unexpected kiss.

Gardenia Petale Eau de Parfum,Van Cleef & Arpels,"Unabashedly lush and feminine, Gardenia Petale is perhaps the truest recreation of the gardenia's sensuality we've encountered. If you've ever dipped your nose into a gardenia's creamy petals, you know the narcotic opulence this flower possesses. In Gardenia Petale, perfumer Nathalie Feisthauer captures all the stages of gardenia's life, from its almost citrusy, green bud to the delicate freshness of a newly opened blossom to the fulsome headiness of the gardenia in full bloom.
Gardenia Petale is an especially rich fragrance with grand sillage. We imagine wearing it on a summer's night when moonlight silvers the garden, or when the streets are carpeted in thick, white snow, setting off the fragrance's pure luxuriance. A dab of Gardenia Petale behind the ears would perfectly complement the view of Paris from the Eiffel Tower, or dinner for two in a room bathed in candlelight.

The resulting fragrance has all the elegance you'd expect of Van Cleef & Arpels presented with warmth and openness.
Orchidee Vanille's subtle, yet almost edible quality makes it the perfect fragrance for romance, but still approachable enough for daily wear.

The perfect poet, discerning connoisseur, Dominique Ropion is an oxymoron all of his own. Master of his art, still modest in spite of his success, he has an additional quality, one that is almost outdated these days: his kindness. How does that fit in with perfumery? Only because it makes his talent even more remarkable... Dominique Ropion trained at the legendary Roure Bertrand Dupont laboratory before going to work with Jean-Louis Sieuzac, one of the perfumery world's great technicians. His work is special because of the tension between precision and freedom. Homme is a modern and mysterious scent. The fragrance opens with a very fresh head made of grapefruit, cardamom and bergamot. The essence then plunge into the spicy heart of Cinnamon, Thyme and Cloves. In the end, Patchouli, Sandalwood and Labdanum gave depth and warm the general accord.

Fleur Nocturne Eau de Parfum,Isabey,"This Nocturnal Flower should've been called China Blue â or rather, Bleu de Chine â after the fragrance launched in 1925 by the house of Isabey, lodged in a China blue bottle designed by the legendary Julien Viard. But when Isabey's owners decided to re-launch the scent, the name Bleu de Chine had been snapped up by another brand. So Fleur Nocturne it is, for a fragrance as tight-grained and creamy-smooth as the most luxurious silk crepe, flowing on the sinuous silhouette of a 1930s film star, its delicate apricot hues lighting up petal-flesh skin. Like Isabey's previous scent Gardenia, Fleur Nocturne revives the opulence and full-blown glamour of classic French perfumery: an aromatic shimmer of mandarin melding into the fragrant juiciness of peach and apricot underlining the fruity facets of jasmine; the slightly soapy, lemony touch of magnolia balancing out the lazy Southern Belle lushness of gardenia. Solar notes add a powdery, tropical-flower tinge to the vanilla drydown, barely darkened by patchouli.
With its ample, long-lasting sillage, Fleur Nocturne will sail you through nights as tender and glorious as a Scott Fitzgerald heroine in the Riviera moonlight.","mandarin, apricot tree flower, white peach, jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, solar notes, vanilla, patchouli",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/27101.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,nocturnal flower called china blue rather bleu de chine fragrance launched house isabey lodged china blue bottle designed legendary julien viard isabey's owners decided launch scent name bleu de chine snapped another brand fleur nocturne fragrance tight grained creamy smooth luxurious silk crepe flowing sinuous silhouette film star delicate apricot hues lighting petal flesh skin like isabey's previous scent gardenia fleur nocturne revives opulence full blown glamour classic french perfumery aromatic shimmer mandarin melding fragrant juiciness peach apricot underlining fruity facets jasmine slightly soapy lemony touch magnolia balancing lazy southern belle lushness gardenia solar notes add powdery tropical flower tinge vanilla drydown barely darkened patchouli ample long lasting sillage fleur nocturne sail nights tender glorious scott fitzgerald heroine riviera moonlight,"mandarin, apricot tree flower, white peach, jasmine, gardenia, magnolia, solar notes, vanilla, patchouli"
Aqua Universalis Eau de Toilette,Maison Francis Kurkdjian,"The name is Latin for Universal Water, and the scent does what it says on the bottle. Francis Kurkdjian calls it the missing link between skin, clothes, bed linen and the air and he's spot on.

Intelligence & Fantasy Eau de Toilette,The Beautiful Mind Series,"Fragrance and memory are intimately bonded, not only because a scent can summon an absent person or a bygone moment, but also because memory â the recollection of thousands of notes and accords â is an essential dimension of the perfumer's art. It is only fitting then that the Grand Master of Memory Christiane Stenger should be the muse of the Geza Schoen for the first installment of The Beautiful Mind series, dedicated to women gifted with exceptional skills.
But fans of the Berlin-based perfumer may be in for a shock. Unlike the conceptual, minimalist Escentric Molecules scents he created, The Beautiful Mind is a sensuous, shimmering floral whose heart is the rare and precious absolute of tiare, a Tahitian variety of gardenia. Bergamot, mandarin and pink pepper brighten the creaminess of the tropical blossom; magnolia, freesia, osmanthus and hedione adorn it with fresh lemon, violet, apricot and green jasmine facets; musk wraps it in a huge, fluffy-powdery cloud. Cedar, sandalwood and Cashmeran ground it in a luscious, woody-balsamic base. Geza Schoen calls it 'an ode to summer and its memories'; we say that if this is what Ms. Stenger's memories smell like, we'd very much like her to remember us.","magnolia bud, bergamot, mandarin, schinus molle (pink peppercorn), freesia, osmanthus, rose oil, hedione, tiare absolute, cedar, musk, sandalwood cashmeran",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/49600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fragrance memory intimately bonded scent summon absent person bygone moment also memory recollection thousands notes accords essential dimension perfumer's art fitting grand master memory christiane stenger muse geza schoen first installment beautiful mind series dedicated women gifted exceptional skills fans berlin based perfumer may shock unlike conceptual minimalist escentric molecules scents created beautiful mind sensuous shimmering floral whose heart rare precious absolute tiare tahitian variety gardenia bergamot mandarin pink pepper brighten creaminess tropical blossom magnolia freesia osmanthus hedione adorn fresh lemon violet apricot green jasmine facets musk wraps huge fluffy powdery cloud cedar sandalwood cashmeran ground luscious woody balsamic base geza schoen calls 'an ode summer memories' say ms stenger's memories smell like we'd much like remember us,"magnolia bud, bergamot, mandarin, schinus molle (pink peppercorn), freesia, osmanthus, rose oil, hedione, tiare absolute, cedar, musk, sandalwood cashmeran"

Al Oudh Eau de Parfum,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"Oud may be the new black, as far as perfume notes are concerned. But Bertrand Duchaufour's take on the uber-fashionable Middle-Eastern material lives up to the expectations raised by one of the most distinctive talents in the business. Hot on the heels of Havana Vanille, this new installment of L'Artisan Parfumeur's groundbreaking Voyages series manages to combine Duchaufour's signature smooth, transparent woods with an animalic twist that should enthrall fans of oud, leather and spices alike.
Cumin and roses sweetened with a bite of candied dates conjure Oriental delicacies between wisps of incense before the medicinal notes of saffron and oud rise to the fore. From then on, a soft but unmistakably natural oud takes center stage, veering towards leather before sinking in the inkiness of castoreum; civet adds a whiff of the beast to the brew.
As Al Oudh slides into its drydown, the comforting sensuousness of a balsamic vanilla and tonka bean base turns its desert lion growl into a purr. Strictly for animal lovers.

Patchouli Intense Eau de Parfum,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Patchouli is a material of great importance in the perfumer's palette. It plays as first violin in the orchestra. Among all the woody notes, it is the most sensuous. Patchouli evokes richness', writes Patricia de Nicolae. With Patchouli Homme, the perfumer wanted to compose a woody oriental for men, but she ended up selling it to women too (which is why it will soon be renamed Patchouli Intense). And why not? This distinctly un-hippie patchouli straddles both sides of the olfactory gender spectrum, with Patricia de Nicolae signature candied orange opening, sprinkled with cinnamon, sweetening the wedding of a deep, dark, earthy patch and its natural partner, rose. A passing quote of the fougere family â lavender and geranium â lightens the heart of this heady blend before it subsides into an incense-laden, almost tarry leather drydown that plays up the smokier facets of vanilla. A sophisticated patchouli for dandies (both male and female) who aren't afraid of snagging a sleeve on a rose bush when they go out in the garden to pick their boutonniere.","lavender, rose, geranium bourbon, frankincense, sandalwood, bay oil, cinnamon, patchouli, leather, amber, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/31331.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,patchouli material great importance perfumer's palette plays first violin orchestra among woody notes sensuous patchouli evokes richness' writes patricia de nicolae patchouli homme perfumer wanted compose woody oriental men ended selling women soon renamed patchouli intense distinctly un hippie patchouli straddles sides olfactory gender spectrum patricia de nicolae signature candied orange opening sprinkled cinnamon sweetening wedding deep dark earthy patch natural partner rose passing quote fougere family lavender geranium lightens heart heady blend subsides incense laden almost tarry leather drydown plays smokier facets vanilla sophisticated patchouli dandies male female afraid snagging sleeve rose bush go garden pick boutonniere,"lavender, rose, geranium bourbon, frankincense, sandalwood, bay oil, cinnamon, patchouli, leather, amber, vanilla"
Midnight Oud Eau de Parfum,Juliette Has a Gun,"Romano Ricci conceived his opus as a European vision of oud that evokes the mysterious and intriguing woman who hides behind her veil. Midnight Oud is a love song written for that ancient musical instrument called Oud in a palace where the walls are rose petals, the air breathes golden saffron and the floor is scented with sacred agarwood.
The heavy oriental notes of traditional ouds are represented here in a very wearable and refined manner. Midnight Oud is crafted as a bridge between the perfect balance of rose-chypre-patchouli and the purest Oud perfume note. It is an imaginary black flower with glittery saffron and soft incense notes, and the heavy Moroccan rose petals become a precious liquor laced with tobacco, amber, agarwood and dried fruits. The resulting scent is rich, velvety and opulent, finding the right harmony between the dark strength of Arabian perfumes and the modern idea of richness.","rose, geranium, saffron, oud note, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, animalic musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40104.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,romano ricci conceived opus european vision oud evokes mysterious intriguing woman hides behind veil midnight oud love song written ancient musical instrument called oud palace walls rose petals air breathes golden saffron floor scented sacred agarwood heavy oriental notes traditional ouds represented wearable refined manner midnight oud crafted bridge perfect balance rose chypre patchouli purest oud perfume note imaginary black flower glittery saffron soft incense notes heavy moroccan rose petals become precious liquor laced tobacco amber agarwood dried fruits resulting scent rich velvety opulent finding right harmony dark strength arabian perfumes modern idea richness,"rose, geranium, saffron, oud note, patchouli, sandalwood, amber, animalic musk"

One breath of Epic's rich top notes of fiery cinnamon and languid cumin, and the image of Aladdin's cave filled with gold, pearls, tea, silks, jade, spices and frankincense unfolds in front of our spellbound eyes.

Feminite du Bois Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"A milestone in the history of contemporary perfumery, Feminite du Bois can be considered as the template of Serge Lutens' trademark woods, fruit and spices variations. As the stories goes, Lutens, who had yet to launch his Salons du Palais Royal line, dragged the Shiseido and Quest teams to Marrakech to make them understand just what he was after: the quintessence of Atlas cedar. Christopher Sheldrake was the one who caught on; the great Pierre Bourdon completed the formula. The result was a breakthrough in the world of women's fragrances: a dark, honeyed, animalic wood rubbed with candied fruit, sweet balms and the slow burn of spices, encrusted with the amethyst flash of violets. Today, Feminite du Bois, the mother of all Lutens fragrances, has left Shiseido and found its true home. It has shed its strangely compelling dusty pink and plum flacon and Lutens has officially admitted that the formula was slightly tweaked to comply with new regulations, though he maintains that 'the quality (creative and olfactive) remains authentic'. Aficionados may find the top notes a tad softer and the base a little muskier, but the fragrance is still entirely, deliciously Feminite du Bois. A masterpiece.","ginger, cinnamon, clove, plum, peach, orange blossom, violet, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, benzoin",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36131.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,milestone history contemporary perfumery feminite du bois considered template serge lutens' trademark woods fruit spices variations stories goes lutens yet launch salons du palais royal line dragged shiseido quest teams marrakech make understand quintessence atlas cedar christopher sheldrake one caught great pierre bourdon completed formula result breakthrough world women's fragrances dark honeyed animalic wood rubbed candied fruit sweet balms slow burn spices encrusted amethyst flash violets today feminite du bois mother lutens fragrances left shiseido found true home shed strangely compelling dusty pink plum flacon lutens officially admitted formula slightly tweaked comply new regulations though maintains 'the quality creative olfactive remains authentic' aficionados may find top notes tad softer base little muskier fragrance still entirely deliciously feminite du bois masterpiece,"ginger, cinnamon, clove, plum, peach, orange blossom, violet, cedar, sandalwood, vanilla, benzoin"
Wazamba Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Named after a musical instrument often used in initiation ceremonies in Western Africa, Wazamba symbolizes an inner journey characteristic of many great civilizations.

The journey down to the inky heart of Black Afgano is a scent trip only for the daring among you. If you're a lover of light, bright and airy fragrances, then you'll want to stop reading right about...now. Aiming to capture the qualities of hashish (without the police banging down your door), mystery and intrigue has followed this perfume since its inception. Rumors swirled that the debut of Afgano was held up for months due to the necessary procurement and smuggling of the.. eh, 'raw material' (nudge nudge, wink wink). But it was definitely worth the wait. For those asking the obvious, no, it doesn't smell exactly like burning hashish... or so we hear, of course. Black Afgano is meant to capture some of the scent qualities and all of the effects of the herb: smoky, smooth and deep; a mellow yet deep and distinct fragrance high. The black colored perfume is a study in how to arouse the effects of temporary bliss, without all the side effects. Rich and hypnotic, with dark and dangerous notes, this is a beautifully relentless and utterly enveloping scent.

Tam Dao - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"In discussing Holy Grail fragrances with sandalwood lovers, Tam Dao is a name that comes up again and again. While not solely sandalwood, this blend of woods and ambergris features a gorgeous, dry sandalwood note that has earned it a devoted following. The opening is primarily cypress, very green and sharp, with a vaguely industrial feel. Then the blend of exotic incense-like sandalwood and softer, sweeter rosewood begins to develop slowly. The sandalwood becomes luxurious and creamy, with additional richness from the ambergris. Luminous and tranquil, with a meditative quality â Tam Dao smells a like a precious carved object. Even at its creamiest, it still has that authentic, dry bite of freshly-hewn wood and that transparent quality that is the hallmark of so many Diptyque scents.

L'eau Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"The very first personal fragrance created by Diptyque, L'Eau is based on a 16th century potpourri recipe and is brimming with eccentric charm. It opens with a cobweb-clearing dose of clove and cinnamon with a touch of sweetness, like some marvelous 16th century rendition of red hots, and it stays spicy for awhile, until the soothing sandalwood steps in and the clove and cinnamon calm down. Please take note, the clove and cinnamon do not disappear â they just settle into a minuet with sandalwood, geranium and rose that is surprisingly genteel and elegant. It is easy to imagine wearing this fragrance in another time â riding in a horse drawn carriage to visit the country, pressing a single rose in the pages of a book as a memento of a chance encounter, following the elaborate rituals of courtship of an earlier age. Yet, it has a lively freshness and graceful warmth that translates beautifully to modern times.","cinnamon, clove, geranium, sandalwood, rose",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48386.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,first personal fragrance created diptyque l'eau based th century potpourri recipe brimming eccentric charm opens cobweb clearing dose clove cinnamon touch sweetness like marvelous th century rendition red hots stays spicy awhile soothing sandalwood steps clove cinnamon calm please take note clove cinnamon disappear settle minuet sandalwood geranium rose surprisingly genteel elegant easy imagine wearing fragrance another time riding horse drawn carriage visit country pressing single rose pages book memento chance encounter following elaborate rituals courtship earlier age yet lively freshness graceful warmth translates beautifully modern times,"cinnamon, clove, geranium, sandalwood, rose"
Olene Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"White flowers without apologies. A lush cascade of wisteria, narcissus, honeysuckle and, most prominently, jasmine. A fierce, take-no-prisoner sort of jasmine, with an opening so boldly indolic that it almost gives you a head rush. As it wears on the skin this softens â the jasmine becomes delicate, the honeysuckle's intense sweetness mellows, and the fresh-cut narcissus and gentle wisteria make their presence known -- and Olene transforms into something absolutely beautiful: that perfect marriage of clean and sweet that is the hallmark of a classic white floral. Unlike many jasmine-centric scents, this has airiness and a hint of green that makes it appropriate for day as well as evening. Fresh and feminine.","wisteria, jasmine, narcissus, honeysuckle",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48309.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,white flowers without apologies lush cascade wisteria narcissus honeysuckle prominently jasmine fierce take prisoner sort jasmine opening boldly indolic almost gives head rush wears skin softens jasmine becomes delicate honeysuckle's intense sweetness mellows fresh cut narcissus gentle wisteria make presence known olene transforms something absolutely beautiful perfect marriage clean sweet hallmark classic white floral unlike many jasmine centric scents airiness hint green makes appropriate day well evening fresh feminine,"wisteria, jasmine, narcissus, honeysuckle"
Oyedo Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"A vibrant and uplifting meditation on citrus, named in honor of Yedo (also known as Edo) the ancient name for Tokyo. A sparkling spritz of lemon and a squeeze of piquant green mandarine start things off with a jolt - fresh, realistic and dazzlingly bright. A delectable sweet orange joins in, dusted with sugar and nearly effervescent, and just when it seems like the whole thing might float off in a fizzy, candy-coated bubble, a bracing dash of cool thyme and tart tamarind keep Oyedo balanced and intriguing.

L'Ombre dans l'Eau - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"An amazingly evocative scent, this transports you to an English riverside garden with overgrown roses and a tangle of blackcurrant bushes. This is startlingly green, almost astringent, in the opening and then the roses appear 'fresh and vivid and beautiful. You can smell the wet earth of the riverbank and the berries weighing down the branches and the older petals that have fallen to the ground. The name translates as 'Shadow in the Water', and appropriately, there is a hint of melancholy here, a touch of the bittersweet. However, there is also a rejuvenating freshness â perhaps the riverside garden is where we go to recover from heartbreak.

Do Son - Eau de Toilette,Diptyque,"Do Son is inspired directly from Yves Coueslant's childhood in Vietnam, where he grew up in Haiphong, a port in Northern Indo-China. Not far from there, in the little seaside resort of Do Son, his father had a pagoda built by the sea to go to and enjoy the sea air at the end of the day. Do Son recalls the memory of this place where flower fragrances dominate, in particular the tuberose, whose scent his mother particularly loves. In Do Son, the tuberose and Turkish rose bouquet expresses a sweet flavour freshened up with the orange blossom leaf and the rose berries. The white musk and the iris add a delicately powdered aspect to it.","tuberose, orange tree leaves, rose berries, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/48306.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,son inspired directly yves coueslant's childhood vietnam grew haiphong port northern indo china far little seaside resort son father pagoda built sea go enjoy sea air end day son recalls memory place flower fragrances dominate particular tuberose whose scent mother particularly loves son tuberose turkish rose bouquet expresses sweet flavour freshened orange blossom leaf rose berries white musk iris add delicately powdered aspect,"tuberose, orange tree leaves, rose berries, musk"
Reflection Man Eau de Parfum,Amouage,"The quintessence of masculine elegance, Reflection Man captures the seductive power of a man's inner strength. Edgy and classic, the composition juxtaposes coldness of citrus with the warmth of spices. Top notes of rosemary, red pepper and bitter orange leaves are chilly and bracing, a jolting breath of icy air in the midst of summer. The piquancy, which is apparent from the start, is rich and fiery, but never sharp, smoothed and softened by the presence of velvety orris and creamy ylang-ylang. Floral notes contribute to the sun-drenched, summery feel of the blend without compromising its undeniably masculine feel. The base of vetiver, patchouli and sandalwood, combined with the spices and orris, is dark, enveloping, and sensual. Virile and unexpectedly soft at the same time...a luxurious modern classic.","rosemary, red pepper berries, bitter orange leaves, neroli, orris, jasmine, ylang-ylang, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/41819.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,quintessence masculine elegance reflection man captures seductive power man's inner strength edgy classic composition juxtaposes coldness citrus warmth spices top notes rosemary red pepper bitter orange leaves chilly bracing jolting breath icy air midst summer piquancy apparent start rich fiery never sharp smoothed softened presence velvety orris creamy ylang ylang floral notes contribute sun drenched summery feel blend without compromising undeniably masculine feel base vetiver patchouli sandalwood combined spices orris dark enveloping sensual virile unexpectedly soft time luxurious modern classic,"rosemary, red pepper berries, bitter orange leaves, neroli, orris, jasmine, ylang-ylang, vetiver, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood"
Complex Eau de Parfum,Boadicea the Victorious,"The mood is Gothic; the scene, a dungeon; the scent, an unsettling dip into olfactory taboos. This is leather at its darkest, spiked with metallic studs of violet, lashed with the aromatic essences of basil and sage. Musk straddles the boundary between the herbal and animal realms, before submitting to the whip of leather â tarry, bitter, almost licorice-like in its somber facets. An animal aroma of Oud wood suffuses the scene with the smell of hot, yielding flesh. Incense fumes bathe the ritual in their searing whorls.

Tom of Finland Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"Created for the eponymous artist's Foundation, Tom of Finland, is an ode to masculine beauty. It is that rare marvel, a clean leather scent. There is no tar here, just a delightful hint of smoke that lingers over a clear watery accord, blending the tang of lemon with the sparkle of aldehydes. The fragrance enhances the perfume of one's freshly-showered skin, revealing the true sensual power of a wearer's own aroma. We adore the aromatic, forest-like aspect of the fragrance: birch, pine, cypress and galbanum are simultaneously reminiscent of the great outdoors and, surprisingly in such a modern creation, of some of the most elegant masculine scents of the past. The softness of the base of suede, vanilla, tonka bean and orris is a bliss that lasts forever. A new cult favorite for the lovers of leather perfumes of both genders.

Putain des Palaces Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"We are likely to fall for any perfume that makes us quietly hum Serge Gainsbourg's song in our rather imperfect French (and there aren't nearly enough of those!). And, when the perfume is as stunning as Putain des Palaces-- well, what can we say? We are madly in love! This sensuous fantasy of a scent is dressed for seduction: the powdery, rose-violet aroma of a lipstick, a hint of supple leather, a touch of spice, a subtle, insinuating animal quality of musk...the sensuality of silk and lace...the perfume of a temptress in a boudoir, coquettish, languid and a little dangerous.

Secretions Magnifiques Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"Etat Libre d'Orange is a newly liberated olfactory territory, a land free of any taboos and preconceptions. A land where perfume is art and perfumers have free reign. It is only in free-thinking lands like this that truly original fragrances can be born, the ones that make us gasp not only because of the provocativeness of their concepts but because of the staggering innovation of their composition. And no scent is more original than Etat Libre d'Orange's bete noire, Secretions Magnifiques. An ode to sensual pleasure, to the rush of adrenalin, to tension and relief, this subversive perfume tricks you into smelling things you had never expected to smell in a perfume. The insinuating, saline sensuality of its iode-blood-milk accord is extraordinary. It is a perfume-chameleon: on some it will smell astoundingly animalic and on others it will be almost childlike in its softness.

Jasmin et Cigarette Eau de Parfum,Etat Libre d'Orange,"A tailored suit, a fedora, a blond bob, scarlet lips and a cigarette â that's Jasmin et Cigarette. Etat Libre d'Orange's homage to femmes fatales of days past, this is a glamorous vamp of a perfume. Think Dietrich or Garbo. The jasmine note, sweetened by apricot and tonka bean, has a husky, honeyed quality akin to a sensual, throaty whisper. And just like Marlene and Greta, Jasmin et Cigarette has a distinctly androgynous side that coexists so unexpectedly well with the obvious femininity of the blend. Tobacco, woods and musk represent the touch of masculinity that was the trademark of the two great divas. Fresh and sultry, transparent and smoky, Jasmin et Cigarette is a stunning tribute to the allure of contrasts.","jasmine absolute, tobacco, hay, apricot, tonka bean, turmeric, cedar, amber, musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/47710.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,tailored suit fedora blond bob scarlet lips cigarette that's jasmin et cigarette etat libre d'orange's homage femmes fatales days past glamorous vamp perfume think dietrich garbo jasmine note sweetened apricot tonka bean husky honeyed quality akin sensual throaty whisper like marlene greta jasmin et cigarette distinctly androgynous side coexists unexpectedly well obvious femininity blend tobacco woods musk represent touch masculinity trademark two great divas fresh sultry transparent smoky jasmin et cigarette stunning tribute allure contrasts,"jasmine absolute, tobacco, hay, apricot, tonka bean, turmeric, cedar, amber, musk"

The Good Girl vibe of the scent is shocking given the suggestive name, and therein lies the genius of the fragrance. But is the girl really all that innocent?

Vepres Siciliennes Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"With Vepres Siciliennes, a verdant fruity chypre, Perfumer Jeanne-Marie Faugier embarks upon a different olfactory journey â a journey to bella Italia. As the heat of the afternoon gives way to the early evening, it is a magical hour: Night is falling soon. The intoxicating smell of the orange orchards, still warm from the sun, rise up to meet the mysteries at hand for the evening, as lovers wait for the languor of evening shadows, and assassins heed the gathering darkness. Inspired by Verdi's opera of the same name, this fragrance honors the duality of man's nature â the peaceful time of prayer and the uncertain dangers that await.
The fragrance begins as a haunting, rich, lovely ode to an Italian tapestry of scent as we stroll through the orchard, with its smell of peppery citrus and crushed green leaves. Unexpectedly we encounter scents drifting from a distant garden on the quiet breeze... the warm, sensual flowers of jasmine, magnolia, ylang ylang and heliotrope mingling with the earthy woods of cedar and oakmoss. The fragrance, like the day, then takes an unexpected twist-- instead of a drydown of woods, only then is the secret, surprising heart of the fragrance revealed: Fruits and flowers when we least expect it. An early evening banquet is set out: Osmanthus, raspberry, clove, plum and peach entice us to linger, even as the shadows grow long beside us and the day grows still. It is the time for Vespers, and all is not what it seems. An unexpectedly rich scent that evolves continually and delightfully for hours.","mandarin, grapefruit, peach, pepper, green leaves, cardamom, muguet, magnolia, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus, raspberry, cloves, plum, coconut, musk, amber, oakmoss, cedarwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36508.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,vepres siciliennes verdant fruity chypre perfumer jeanne marie faugier embarks upon different olfactory journey journey bella italia heat afternoon gives way early evening magical hour night falling soon intoxicating smell orange orchards still warm sun rise meet mysteries hand evening lovers wait languor evening shadows assassins heed gathering darkness inspired verdi's opera name fragrance honors duality man's nature peaceful time prayer uncertain dangers await fragrance begins haunting rich lovely ode italian tapestry scent stroll orchard smell peppery citrus crushed green leaves unexpectedly encounter scents drifting distant garden quiet breeze warm sensual flowers jasmine magnolia ylang ylang heliotrope mingling earthy woods cedar oakmoss fragrance like day takes unexpected twist instead drydown woods secret surprising heart fragrance revealed fruits flowers least expect early evening banquet set osmanthus raspberry clove plum peach entice us linger even shadows grow long beside us day grows still time vespers seems unexpectedly rich scent evolves continually delightfully hours,"mandarin, grapefruit, peach, pepper, green leaves, cardamom, muguet, magnolia, jasmine, ylang-ylang, rose, tuberose, heliotrope, osmanthus, raspberry, cloves, plum, coconut, musk, amber, oakmoss, cedarwood"
Sublime Balkiss Eau de Parfum,The Different Company,"Balkiss was the name of the Queen of Sheba, the lover of King Solomon. But don't expect a spice-laden oriental. And though Celine Ellena, who co-founded The Different Company along with her father Jean-Claude and legendary bottle designer Thierry de Baschmakoff, touts Sublime Balkiss as a chypre, don't expect a classic chypre either.
The canonic bergamot-labdanum-oakmoss trilogy has been set aside and the scent retains only the structure of the chypre: mouthwatering bergamot, astringent cassis and blackberries stage the juicy, slightly raspy opening burst; damascene rose, lily of the valley and lilac provide the soft floral heart, with a lashing of green violet leaves and heather; two different types of patchouli grounding the composition. One is the traditional essence of patchouli; the other, more unusual one, is a fraction of patchouli essential oil, which brings out the cocoa facets of the heart notes (a chocolate-like effect similar in Serge Lutens' Borneo 1834).
With its berry top notes and patchouli base, Sublime Balkiss is sure to appeal to Angel fans â if you've given up on Thierry Mugler's classic because it was too popular, or too potent, you'll find the familar accord played in the lighter hand of the trademark Ellena style.","bergamot, cassis, blackberries, rose, lily of the valley, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli fraction, patchouli essence, heather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/25322.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,balkiss name queen sheba lover king solomon expect spice laden oriental though celine ellena co founded different company along father jean claude legendary bottle designer thierry de baschmakoff touts sublime balkiss chypre expect classic chypre either canonic bergamot labdanum oakmoss trilogy set aside scent retains structure chypre mouthwatering bergamot astringent cassis blackberries stage juicy slightly raspy opening burst damascene rose lily valley lilac provide soft floral heart lashing green violet leaves heather two different types patchouli grounding composition one traditional essence patchouli unusual one fraction patchouli essential oil brings cocoa facets heart notes chocolate like effect similar serge lutens' borneo berry top notes patchouli base sublime balkiss sure appeal angel fans given thierry mugler's classic popular potent find familar accord played lighter hand trademark ellena style,"bergamot, cassis, blackberries, rose, lily valley, violet leaf, lilac, patchouli fraction, patchouli essence, heather"
Nuit de Cellophane Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Cellophane night? The name was meant to shock, says the enigmatic maestro of the Palais Royal -- though what it alludes to is simply the material used to wrap bouquets in flower shops.
At first sniff, you may think Serge Lutens has gone mainstream. Nuit de Cellophane is, undeniably, a fruity floral drowned in a cloud of fluffy musk. But smell more closely, and the little night music running through the Lutens opus will make itself heard: the stained-glass light of mandarin, warmed by the solar cinnamon roundness of myrrh, drowns the dusk-blooming, indolic jasmine in sunset hues. A slight mentholated whiff betrays a roving tuberose throwing her green flash.
Chinese osmanthus, with its juicy apricot sweetness and suede-like facets, is offset by the clove-y warmth of carnation and the milky lushness of almonds. A touch of lily adds smokiness to the blend, melding into the woody, creamy sandalwood base drowned in honey. A deceptively innocent, multi-textured fragrance whose carnal whispers will draw you into the luminescent sparkle of a cellophane night...","green note, fruity note, jasmine, osmanthus, carnation, lily, muscs, almond, wood, honey",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36128.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,cellophane night name meant shock says enigmatic maestro palais royal though alludes simply material used wrap bouquets flower shops first sniff may think serge lutens gone mainstream nuit de cellophane undeniably fruity floral drowned cloud fluffy musk smell closely little night music running lutens opus make heard stained glass light mandarin warmed solar cinnamon roundness myrrh drowns dusk blooming indolic jasmine sunset hues slight mentholated whiff betrays roving tuberose throwing green flash chinese osmanthus juicy apricot sweetness suede like facets offset clove warmth carnation milky lushness almonds touch lily adds smokiness blend melding woody creamy sandalwood base drowned honey deceptively innocent multi textured fragrance whose carnal whispers draw luminescent sparkle cellophane night,"green note, fruity note, jasmine, osmanthus, carnation, lily, muscs, almond, wood, honey"
Peche Cardinal Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Peche Cardinal is an enticing froth of sinful and sweet, blending luscious fruits and mesmerizingly heady white flowers into a siren song. Warm, rounded and alluring, this Bellini-esque scent opens with a juicy, light-hearted sweetness that belies its intoxicating nature. As it warms on the skin, it becomes boldly flirtatious â this is the perfect scent for the belle of the ball. Peche Cardinal (translation: Cardinal Sin) opens with the apricot-hay sweetness of davana combined with the silken fur of ripe golden peaches and creamy coconut. The tart fruitiness of blackcurrant and prune keep the fragrance from becoming too sweet, allowing the cool, fresh-from-the-flowershop tuberose to shine from the heart of the composition. White lilies add an additional, slightly green aspect to the scent. The cedar, sandalwood and musc provide a quiet contrapunto to the fruits. An unabashedly romantic fragrance for those daring enough to wear it.","davana, peach, coconut, blackcurrant, tuberose, prune, lily, cedar, sandalwood, musc",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36505.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,peche cardinal enticing froth sinful sweet blending luscious fruits mesmerizingly heady white flowers siren song warm rounded alluring bellini esque scent opens juicy light hearted sweetness belies intoxicating nature warms skin becomes boldly flirtatious perfect scent belle ball peche cardinal translation cardinal sin opens apricot hay sweetness davana combined silken fur ripe golden peaches creamy coconut tart fruitiness blackcurrant prune keep fragrance becoming sweet allowing cool fresh flowershop tuberose shine heart composition white lilies add additional slightly green aspect scent cedar sandalwood musc provide quiet contrapunto fruits unabashedly romantic fragrance daring enough wear,"davana, peach, coconut, blackcurrant, tuberose, prune, lily, cedar, sandalwood, musc"

Almost immediately, the fragrance deepens to welcome an armload of fragrant spring flowers, including rose, jasmine, neroli, and iris, all smelling as if they're drenched in rain water.

Soon the fragrance deepens and you are sipping spicy tea in a market, the scent of frankincense, plums, and fresh flowers drifting in from the market outside.

Gold Woman is just that fragrance. Legendary perfumer Guy Robert created Gold using the highest quality ingredients that money could buy. He artfully melded more than 120 essences into an opulent perfume he calls the ""crowning glory"" of his career. Gold opens with a champagne-like burst of greens and lily of the valley, giving way to a floral symphony rich with rose and jasmine but so lushly orchestrated that it's difficult to isolate any one note. As Gold settles, it begins to purr with the warmth of sandalwood and frankincense. Gold lasts for hours and hours, and a little goes a long way.

Vanitas Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Just what we're always on the look-out for â a vanilla scent that is sophisticated and complex, but still delicious and comforting. Vanitas opens with a chilly dose of myrrh, which is almost medicinal at first, but as it warms on the skin, its deep, resinous sweetness emerges and blends with the creamy warmth of truly excellent vanilla. Delicate orange flower enhances the high notes, and sandalwood adds a dark golden bass line â but the heart of this accord is the exquisite pairing of vanilla and myrrh. The myrrh adds mystery to all the luscious qualities we love in vanilla and brings in a dark sweetness that is not at all food like. Happily, it adds just enough of a cool edge to keep things intriguing, but not enough to overpower our beloved vanilla. Soft, enveloping and tantalizing - this is the grown-up vanilla we've dreamed about.","vanilla, myrrh, orange flower, sandalwood",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33926.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,we're always look vanilla scent sophisticated complex still delicious comforting vanitas opens chilly dose myrrh almost medicinal first warms skin deep resinous sweetness emerges blends creamy warmth truly excellent vanilla delicate orange flower enhances high notes sandalwood adds dark golden bass line heart accord exquisite pairing vanilla myrrh myrrh adds mystery luscious qualities love vanilla brings dark sweetness food like happily adds enough cool edge keep things intriguing enough overpower beloved vanilla soft enveloping tantalizing grown vanilla we've dreamed,"vanilla, myrrh, orange flower, sandalwood"

Domenico Caraceni 1913 Eau de Toilette,Domenico Caraceni,"Domenico Caraceni is known as the father of Italian tailoring, so it goes without saying that any fragrance bearing his name would have to be as elegant and unique as a impeccably fitted bespoke suit. Luckily, Domenico Caraceni 1913 does justice to its namesake with an elegant, chypre-inflected men's scent with the character and individuality to make anyone who wears it feel like it was made especially for them. While classically structured with top notes of citrus, a heart of geranium and a base of mossy woods, Domenico Caraceni 1913 has a distinctly modern, even edgy feel, largely because of the presence of a distinct and stunning frankincense note. The note, apparent from start to finish, combines beautifully with the citrus top notes, creating an effect that is husky-sweet, almost smoky. In the heart of the fragrance, it enriches the geranium, rose and tobacco, adding an earthy, spicy undertone to the sultry mix. The piquancy is further emphasized by the cypress note, with its gloriously mentholated, almost pine-like aroma. Although originally meant for men, Domenico Caraceni would be as wonderful on a woman as â you guessed it! - an impeccably tailored suit.","petit grain, styrax, geranium bourbon, neroli bigarade, rose, tobacco, cypress, frankincense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/40600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,domenico caraceni known father italian tailoring goes without saying fragrance bearing name would elegant unique impeccably fitted bespoke suit luckily domenico caraceni justice namesake elegant chypre inflected men's scent character individuality make anyone wears feel like made especially classically structured top notes citrus heart geranium base mossy woods domenico caraceni distinctly modern even edgy feel largely presence distinct stunning frankincense note note apparent start finish combines beautifully citrus top notes creating effect husky sweet almost smoky heart fragrance enriches geranium rose tobacco adding earthy spicy undertone sultry mix piquancy emphasized cypress note gloriously mentholated almost pine like aroma although originally meant men domenico caraceni would wonderful woman guessed impeccably tailored suit,"petit grain, styrax, geranium bourbon, neroli bigarade, rose, tobacco, cypress, frankincense"

Cologne Cedrat Eau de Cologne,PARFUMS DE NICOLAI,"Said to be Patricia de Nicolai's personal favorite, Cedrat was inspired by the aroma of citron, a citrus fruit that is similar to lemon. The fragrance is wonderfully fresh, like a welcome wave of cool air or a gulp of ice-cold water on a very hot day.

Clair de Musc Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"There are musks that are sultry and carnal, the dirty, animalic musks full of heavy-lidded sensuality. Clair de Musc is something entirely different, a musk that is luminous and transparent, with the delicate, pure, radiant beauty that is nothing short of angelic.

Un Bois Vanille Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Picture yourself far away from the city, surrounded by tall, hundred-year-old trees, the hush of the forest broken by the crackling of a small fire. In the air there is a nostalgic blend of burning wood and molten sugar. Yes, we are picturing a marshmallow bubbling and turning dark golden on the end of a stick, and it's making us extremely happy, but this scent is much darker and richer than that simple image from childhood first implies. The wood is deep and pungent and singed at the edges, and the vanilla is rich and enveloping, its sweetness tempered with bitter almond. There is the tantalizing aspect of something caramelizing â not caramel candy, this is not a candy sort of scent - but the far more mysterious fragrance of sweetness morphing and evolving as it is licked by flame; the indescribable lusciousness of something almost, but not quite, burning. Complex, smoky and warm, this is a vanilla with a definite edge, suitable for grown-ups of all sorts. Dangerously delicious.","black vanilla absolute, licorice, sandalwood, coconut milk, beeswax, caramelized benzoin, bitter almond, gaiac wood, tonka bean",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36113.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,picture far away city surrounded tall hundred year old trees hush forest broken crackling small fire air nostalgic blend burning wood molten sugar yes picturing marshmallow bubbling turning dark golden end stick making us extremely happy scent much darker richer simple image childhood first implies wood deep pungent singed edges vanilla rich enveloping sweetness tempered bitter almond tantalizing aspect something caramelizing caramel candy candy sort scent far mysterious fragrance sweetness morphing evolving licked flame indescribable lusciousness something almost quite burning complex smoky warm vanilla definite edge suitable grown ups sorts dangerously delicious,"black vanilla absolute, licorice, sandalwood, coconut milk, beeswax, caramelized benzoin, bitter almond, gaiac wood, tonka bean"
Datura Noir Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Seductive and mesmerizing, this takes the familiar theme of white flowers, coconut and vanilla and puts a dark and mysterious spin on it. It is still an enchanted tropical isle, but it is midnight and we're not sure exactly what is waiting for us in the deep blue shadows. A wickedly insistent blend of datura, osmanthus, heliotrope and tuberose beckons us to go ever deeper into the dark heart of the jungle. Voluptuous tonka and vanilla lull us into a dreamy haze, while unexpected touches of bitter almond and myrrh keep us wary and on the lookout for danger. Datura Noir does not reveal itself as a straightforward journey, but as a series of flickering impressions: one moment purely floral, the next apricot sweet, and the next richly gourmand. Somehow they all fit together beautifully, like the elements of like a particularly wild and vivid dream. We know that the treacherous datura is a hallucinogenic, but this reminds us of a different altered state â that of being madly, wildly, obsessively in love. Like the song you can't get out of your head, or the face you cannot stop picturing â this is a fragrance you cannot forget.","myrrh, bitter almond, tonka bean, musk, osmanthus, heliotrope, mandarin, lemon blossom, tuberose, vanilla, coconut oil, apricot",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36114.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,seductive mesmerizing takes familiar theme white flowers coconut vanilla puts dark mysterious spin still enchanted tropical isle midnight we're sure exactly waiting us deep blue shadows wickedly insistent blend datura osmanthus heliotrope tuberose beckons us go ever deeper dark heart jungle voluptuous tonka vanilla lull us dreamy haze unexpected touches bitter almond myrrh keep us wary lookout danger datura noir reveal straightforward journey series flickering impressions one moment purely floral next apricot sweet next richly gourmand somehow fit together beautifully like elements like particularly wild vivid dream know treacherous datura hallucinogenic reminds us different altered state madly wildly obsessively love like song can't get head face cannot stop picturing fragrance cannot forget,"myrrh, bitter almond, tonka bean, musk, osmanthus, heliotrope, mandarin, lemon blossom, tuberose, vanilla, coconut oil, apricot"
Geisha Noire Eau de Parfum,Aroma M,"This wickedly seductive blend of amber, sandalwood and tonka bean is getting a makeover due to popular demand. Since its debut in 2000, Geisha Noire has built up a fiercely loyal following of women and men who have fallen under the spell of this dark and intriguing fragrance oil. While they loved the oil, many requested an eau de parfum be made with the same intense film noir mystique, but perhaps a bit more sillage.

Equistrius Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"With Equistrius, the perfumer Marc-Antoine Corticchiato, a competition equestrian, pays tribute to Equistrius, theâÂbright and gleaming horse' which helped him win his most glorious victories, to the legendary Roman Empire and to orris, one of the most precious raw materials used in perfumery.

In elegant and noble Equistrius, a scent truly fit for Roman Gods, the orris speaks majestically. This year brought us a whole plethora of iris scents, and we liked many of them, but it was the refined, enthralling aroma of Equistrius that took our hearts and minds captive. The fragrance combines powdery softness of 'rice powder', the floral delicacy of violet and the unexpected warmth of chocolate to reveal the exquisite facets of the complex aroma of orris. Ambrette butter, rare and intense, with its languid musky notes, adds sensuality to the soft, intimate blend. Rich and sophisticated, ambergris and sandalwood give Equistrius its addictive, mesmerizing appeal.

Rock Crystal Eau de Parfum,Olivier Durbano,"Cristal de Roche (Rock Crystal) is the first of Durbano's 'perfume poems', an enigmatic scent inspired by the myth surrounding rock crystal and the magical, mystical aura of frankincense. Centuries ago, rock crystal was thought to be ice that could not be melted; this mineral represents the link between man and nature, the notion of man's place within the universe and the union of man with a higher force. Frankincense, a resinous substance venerated for centuries in places of worship, is thought to carry prayers uttered by mortals towards the heavens.

Tuberosa Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"We would call this a straightforward tuberose if it weren't for the fact that there is nothing straightforward about tuberose. Ever. It flirts, it teases, it beckons, it distracts, it wraps you around its little finger and whispers sweet nothings in your ear. It keeps you from concentrating on anything practical and tries to convince you to run off for the weekend. This is tuberose at her most bewitching â heady and creamy and fresh, with a flourish of white jasmine and a tantalizing whisper of something warm and spicy that gives this a playfulness that many big florals lack. And make no mistake, this is a big floral. A big, flirtatious, impossible-to-resist floral that will make heads swivel.

Victrix Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"An uplifting scent as crisp and refreshing as a cool wind whipping across an open field. The scintillating pink pepper opening is tamed with earthy vetiver, green laurel and fresh musk for a blend that speaks of broad stretches of undeveloped land and impossibly clean skies. Victrix has an elemental quality: a tingling spiciness that feels like a storm far off on the horizon; the mysterious dark, piny scent of a forest where no tree has ever been cut; the rough coolness of stark expanses of earth and stone. Named for a legion of Ancient Rome, this has a nobility and strength that speaks to another time, but the insistent bite of pepper keeps this thoroughly modern and completely compelling.

Ambra Aurea Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Pure, deep amber at its luxurious best. When you strip it down to the basics, it's all about the quality of the ingredients.

Ambre Topkapi Eau de Parfum,Parfums MDCI,"Created by the renowned perfumer Pierre Bourdon, the first MDCI fragrance for men, Ambre Topkapi was meant to embody strength, power and wealth, and was inspired by the striking figure crowning the men's flacon. The scent, with its bracing and strapping notes, is forceful and daring. We admire the way the tradition and modernity meet and intertwine in this handsome, truly regal composition. The top notes are the perfumer's nod to the classic masculine scents: the beginning of Ambre Topkapi is brightened by bergamot, spiced up by ginger and have a cool, herbal undertone of basil, thyme and lavender. The heart notes, with their combination of luxurious leather and soft, sweet sandalwood, add depth, warmth and what we can only described as a veryâÂexpensive' feel to the blend. In the base, vanilla and amber ornament the scent beautifully, bringing to it a wonderfully exotic feel, making it evocative of faraway lands, luxurious palaces, and Eastern splendor. This unexpected exoticism is where the traditional meets modern. This ambery-vanillic warmth is also what should make Ambre Topkapi wearable for women as well as for men.","bergamot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg ginger, basil, thyme, lavender, oak moss, vetiver, sandalwood, rosewood, leather, darjeeling tea, amber, musk, vanilla, jasmine violet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/36503.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,created renowned perfumer pierre bourdon first mdci fragrance men ambre topkapi meant embody strength power wealth inspired striking figure crowning men's flacon scent bracing strapping notes forceful daring admire way tradition modernity meet intertwine handsome truly regal composition top notes perfumer's nod classic masculine scents beginning ambre topkapi brightened bergamot spiced ginger cool herbal undertone basil thyme lavender heart notes combination luxurious leather soft sweet sandalwood add depth warmth described expensive' feel blend base vanilla amber ornament scent beautifully bringing wonderfully exotic feel making evocative faraway lands luxurious palaces eastern splendor unexpected exoticism traditional meets modern ambery vanillic warmth also make ambre topkapi wearable women well men,"bergamot, grapefruit, pineapple, melon, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg ginger, basil, thyme, lavender, oak moss, vetiver, sandalwood, rosewood, leather, darjeeling tea, amber, musk, vanilla, jasmine violet"

Ambre Sultan Eau de Parfum,Serge Lutens,"Mysterious and strangely moving, Ambre Sultan is the antithesis of the golden, powdery ambers you may be familiar with.

Tubereuse Couture Eau de Parfum,"Pierre Guillaume Paris, Parfumerie Generale","Created in the spirit of High Fashion, Tubereuse Couture is an exotic and elegant fragrance, which contrasts the creamy beauty of tuberose with the mouthwatering, green sweetness of kalamanzi and sugar cane. The striking juxtaposition starts in the top notes, where the tangy fruitiness of citrus is combined with the languorous floral notes of tuberose and ylang-ylang. Ylang-ylang is apparent at all stages of the scent's development and serves to emphasize and strengthen the velvety, enveloping quality of the tuberose. The sugar cane, on the other hand, adds a fresh aspect to the composition, keeping it from becoming overwhelmingly heady and buttery-sweet, as so many tuberose scents are prone to do. The base notes of Tubereuse Couture are resinous, a little powdery, and like the rest of this fashionable blend, very refined.","kalamanzi oil, green jasmine shoots, ylang-ylang, sugar cane, tuberose, sumatra benzoin, papyrus",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/34517.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,created spirit high fashion tubereuse couture exotic elegant fragrance contrasts creamy beauty tuberose mouthwatering green sweetness kalamanzi sugar cane striking juxtaposition starts top notes tangy fruitiness citrus combined languorous floral notes tuberose ylang ylang ylang ylang apparent stages scent's development serves emphasize strengthen velvety enveloping quality tuberose sugar cane hand adds fresh aspect composition keeping becoming overwhelmingly heady buttery sweet many tuberose scents prone base notes tubereuse couture resinous little powdery like rest fashionable blend refined,"kalamanzi oil, green jasmine shoots, ylang-ylang, sugar cane, tuberose, sumatra benzoin, papyrus"

AMAZE Parfum Eau de Parfum,People of the Labyrinths,"To say this fragrance has been highly anticipated would be an understatement. The first fragrance from People of the Labyrinths, Luctor et Emergo, has a rabid cult following that includes all of us here at Luckyscent and we've spent hours discussing what this line's new scent would be like â 'incredibly complex', 'cutting edge', 'something no one expects!' And that last one would be correct, because none of us expected a simple, elegant rose scent. Saffron and henna warm up the opening and there are soft woods and musk in the mix, but mostly there is rose. Not a bouquet of roses or a rose garden, but a single, perfect, magical rose that we can envision clearly --- it's the enchanted rose in 'Beauty and the Beast' floating in its glass dome, wondrous and eternal and glowing. Initially the rose is a bit forceful, but as you wear A*MAZE it melts into your skin and becomes warm and powdery and subtle, as if you just emerged from a rose petal bath. This is a must-try for rose lovers, and you know who you are, but it will also have a lot of appeal for those who enjoy soft, clean fragrances because the drydown is essentially a rosy skin scent. It has even earned the love of one staffer who has sworn repeatedly that she would never wear a rose fragrance. We told you it was enchanting.","henna, saffron, taif rose, orange blossom, wardia rose, agarwood, sandalwood, musk, civet",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/21304.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,say fragrance highly anticipated would understatement first fragrance people labyrinths luctor et emergo rabid cult following includes us luckyscent we've spent hours discussing line's new scent would like 'incredibly complex' 'cutting edge' 'something one expects ' last one would correct none us expected simple elegant rose scent saffron henna warm opening soft woods musk mix mostly rose bouquet roses rose garden single perfect magical rose envision clearly enchanted rose 'beauty beast' floating glass dome wondrous eternal glowing initially rose bit forceful wear maze melts skin becomes warm powdery subtle emerged rose petal bath must try rose lovers know also lot appeal enjoy soft clean fragrances drydown essentially rosy skin scent even earned love one staffer sworn repeatedly would never wear rose fragrance told enchanting,"henna, saffron, taif rose, orange blossom, wardia rose, agarwood, sandalwood, musk, civet"
Ambre Russe Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"The moment we smelled Ambre Russe, we knew that we found our new Holy Grail amber scent. It is a baroque, luxurious perfume; its very notes spell excess. The legendary wealth of the Tsars, the rivers of vodka and champagne, the tea and honey, the sinful leather, the incense burned as an atonement for one's sins â it's all here. As rich as it sounds, however, the fragrance is not heavy or overwhelming; the lavish notes are blended masterfully, smoothly, in a composition that is warm, sensual and comforting. After the initial hot blast of amber and incense, a velvety, honey-like accord becomes apparent, along with the feisty and exhilarating 'boozyness', which lightens the mood of this dark brew. The tea note, combined with spices and leather, adds very enjoyable smokiness and emphasizes the full-bodied, darkly-ornate character of Ambre Russe. This is an extravagant, captivating perfume, quite unlike any other scent we have ever experienced.","tea, incense, vodka, champagne, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ambergris, vanilla, leather",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35700.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,moment smelled ambre russe knew found new holy grail amber scent baroque luxurious perfume notes spell excess legendary wealth tsars rivers vodka champagne tea honey sinful leather incense burned atonement one's sins rich sounds however fragrance heavy overwhelming lavish notes blended masterfully smoothly composition warm sensual comforting initial hot blast amber incense velvety honey like accord becomes apparent along feisty exhilarating 'boozyness' lightens mood dark brew tea note combined spices leather adds enjoyable smokiness emphasizes full bodied darkly ornate character ambre russe extravagant captivating perfume quite unlike scent ever experienced,"tea, incense, vodka, champagne, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ambergris, vanilla, leather"
Cuir Ottoman Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Cuir Ottoman, inspired by 'the erotism and the mystery of the East', is a leather perfume extraordinaire, forceful, elegant and extremely sensual.

A sweet, balsamic leitmotif is always present in the background, perfectly balancing the potent brutality of leather.

Iskander Eau de Parfum,Parfum d'Empire,"Iskander, dedicated to Alexander the Great, is a bracing and fresh fragrance with a slightly spicy and surprisingly warm and earthy undertone. The citrus notes are bright and tangy, the spices are sweetly-piquant, and the musk has an animalic side that we adore. The base of Iskander, with its oakmoss and amber, displays an unexpected, chypre-like, quality and a classic, understated elegance. Minimalist, uncluttered and full of character, Iskander is a scent truly worthy of the Great Conqueror himself.","citron, mandarin, grapefruit, estragon, coriander, orange blossom, oakmoss, amber musk",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/35704.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,iskander dedicated alexander great bracing fresh fragrance slightly spicy surprisingly warm earthy undertone citrus notes bright tangy spices sweetly piquant musk animalic side adore base iskander oakmoss amber displays unexpected chypre like quality classic understated elegance minimalist uncluttered full character iskander scent truly worthy great conqueror,"citron, mandarin, grapefruit, estragon, coriander, orange blossom, oakmoss, amber musk"

Yes, there is a lot of powder here and it's all blended with a deft hand that emphasizes its soft, refined femininity.

Confetto Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"An absolutely gorgeous rendition of almond that teases us with glimpses of bitterness glittering darkly behind the expected sweetness, keeping us unsettled and intrigued and coming back for more. Not that sweetness isn't present in Confetto â it's there, but it's complicated. Without its frequent companions vanilla and rose, almond is less of a comfort food and more of a provocative elixir. A pronounced anise note coaxes out its sensuous side and a soft bed of amber and musk lead it even further away from candyland. For us, Confetto's mesmerizing blend of sugar and shadow created an instant craving and left us weak in the knees.

Dulcis in Fundo Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"This opens with a very fresh, very sweet orange, like a clementine being peeled, complete with the tangy sharpness of citrus oil on your fingers. Then the sweetness intensifies and becomes richer, as if drizzled with Grand Marnier, and a billowy dollop of luscious, creamy, unadulterated vanilla tops it all off. Warm and brazenly sweet, this ambrosial blend is for the woman who wants to smell delicious. This is dessert at its irresistible best: whipped cream being licked off fingers, fits of giggles fueled by liqueur, suggestive whispers over shared spoonfuls. We suspect that more is going on here than citrus and vanilla (some say a saucy little apricot was involved) but perhaps it is just a citrus and a vanilla that get along exceedingly well. Delectable.","citrus fruits, mexican vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33913.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,opens fresh sweet orange like clementine peeled complete tangy sharpness citrus oil fingers sweetness intensifies becomes richer drizzled grand marnier billowy dollop luscious creamy unadulterated vanilla tops warm brazenly sweet ambrosial blend woman wants smell delicious dessert irresistible best whipped cream licked fingers fits giggles fueled liqueur suggestive whispers shared spoonfuls suspect going citrus vanilla say saucy little apricot involved perhaps citrus vanilla get along exceedingly well delectable,"citrus fruits, mexican vanilla"
Fumidus Eau de Parfum,Profumum,"Fumidus means smoky, and smoky it is. The smokiness of aged Laphroaig scotch served neat, It is also earthy âÂ the earthiness of rich, freshly tilled land surrounded by uncut forest. Deep and magnetic and commanding, this blend of rich peat, grassy vetiver and brisk birch conjures up a vast estate and its moody young lord making his way through the fog on an unruly stallion. It's outdoorsy, but in a way that makes it clear that you don't just work in the forest, you own that forest yourself, along with a good bit of grassland and quite possibly a castle. Unmistakably masculine and very sexy.","essence distilled scotch, vetiver root, birch bark",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/33914.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,fumidus means smoky smoky smokiness aged laphroaig scotch served neat also earthy earthiness rich freshly tilled land surrounded uncut forest deep magnetic commanding blend rich peat grassy vetiver brisk birch conjures vast estate moody young lord making way fog unruly stallion outdoorsy way makes clear work forest forest along good bit grassland quite possibly castle unmistakably masculine sexy,"essence distilled scotch, vetiver root, birch bark"
Cardinal Eau de Parfum,HEELEY,"A mesmerizing incense blend that comes dangerously close to putting us into an actual trance. It conjures up a grand, stone-walled cathedral -- not dark, dank or gloomy, but a place of light, majesty and infinite calm. We can envision the dreamy tendrils of smoke rising through sunlight streaming in the stained glass windows and feel the reassuring warmth of wood and sun-warmed stone.

A refined vanilla without being snooty, we can think of several perfumes that trumpet 'vanilla' in their name then try to bury the note under a pile of florals or other notes in an effort to be 'classy.'

Dzongkha Eau de Toilette,L'Artisan Parfumeur,"An incredibly powerful and evocative fragrance composed for l'Artisan Parfumeur by Bertrand Duchaufour. A perfumer who has the passion for travels and who already created Timbuktu inspired by Africa. This time, he drew inspiration from a journey in Bhutan, a little Kingdom located in Eastern Himalayas, between India and China. He composed Dzongkha, a mysterious fragrance inspired by the smell of the stones and incense of the Buddhist temples (the Dzongks), with notes of tanned leather, smoked tea and the evocation of fire places - around which life is organized since the climate is very hard in this region. A fragrance also evocative of the smell of refined flowers that grows in this extraordinarily preserved nature.
A bewildering fragrance, an invitation to spirituality and an inside journey. Its enveloping trail is unexpected, simultaneously intimate and present. This fragrance speaks to both women and men and tells a unique story on each skin: that of Dzongkha, the language of Bhutan. In the top note of Dzongkha, the freshness of peonies and the pink flavor of lychees vibrate with cardamom. The heart of the fragrance is accompanied by chai notes (spicy tea with milk) that soften the strength of wood where vetiver stands out in the fumes of incense. This intensity is accentuated by cypriol (Indian papyrus) and leather notes. Iris with its powdery bottom note symbolizes both the stony aspect and the softness of the fragrance.","lichee, cardamom, peony, iris, tea leaves, incense",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/15238.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,incredibly powerful evocative fragrance composed l'artisan parfumeur bertrand duchaufour perfumer passion travels already created timbuktu inspired africa time drew inspiration journey bhutan little kingdom located eastern himalayas india china composed dzongkha mysterious fragrance inspired smell stones incense buddhist temples dzongks notes tanned leather smoked tea evocation fire places around life organized since climate hard region fragrance also evocative smell refined flowers grows extraordinarily preserved nature bewildering fragrance invitation spirituality inside journey enveloping trail unexpected simultaneously intimate present fragrance speaks women men tells unique story skin dzongkha language bhutan top note dzongkha freshness peonies pink flavor lychees vibrate cardamom heart fragrance accompanied chai notes spicy tea milk soften strength wood vetiver stands fumes incense intensity accentuated cypriol indian papyrus leather notes iris powdery bottom note symbolizes stony aspect softness fragrance,"lichee, cardamom, peony, iris, tea leaves, incense"

1270 Eau de Parfum,Frapin,"Named for the year the Frapin family established itself in the Cognac region of France (and continues to make cognac to this day), 1270 was created by Beatrice Cointreau, great granddaughter of Pierre Frapin. Together with Frapin's Cellar Master, she sought to create a noble fragrance full of the scents surrounding the creation of cognac. 1270 is dry, rich, velvety and smooth. The flowers of the once-proud Folle Blanche (a grape nearly extinct from the region), the vineyard grass, the wine warehouse, the rich smell of damp earth in the cellars, the wood of new casks, the loamy smell of humus where the ancestral cognacs are stored all these notes can be detected in 1270. Gorgeous is putting it mildly... this scent defies flowery prose. A true masterpiece.","exotic woods, spice, raisin, vine flowers, pepper, candied orange, nut, hazelnut, prune, cocoa, coffee, leather, woods, white honey, vanilla",https://static.luckyscent.com/images/products/22600.jpg?width=400&404=product.png,named year frapin family established cognac region france continues make cognac day created beatrice cointreau great granddaughter pierre frapin together frapin's cellar master sought create noble fragrance full scents surrounding creation cognac dry rich velvety smooth flowers proud folle blanche grape nearly extinct region vineyard grass wine warehouse rich smell damp earth cellars wood new casks loamy smell humus ancestral cognacs stored notes detected gorgeous putting mildly scent defies flowery prose true masterpiece,"exotic woods, spice, raisin, vine flowers, pepper, candied orange, nut, hazelnut, prune, cocoa, coffee, leather, woods, white honey, vanilla"
